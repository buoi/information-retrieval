            "Physics (from Ancient Greek: φυσική (ἐπιστήμη), romanized: physikḗ (epistḗmē), lit. 'knowledge of nature', from φύσις phýsis 'nature') is the natural science that studies matter, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves.Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.\n",
            "Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.\n",

            "History\n",
            "Ancient astronomy\n",
            "Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. Early civilizations dating back before 3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians, ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilisation, had a predictive knowledge and a basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. The stars and planets, believed to represent gods, were often worshipped. While the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence, these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found to traverse great circles across the sky, which however did not explain the positions of the planets.\n",
            "According to Asger Aaboe, the origins of Western astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia, and all Western efforts in the exact sciences are descended from late Babylonian astronomy. Egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies, while Greek poet Homer wrote of various celestial objects in his Iliad and Odyssey; later Greek astronomers provided names, which are still used today, for most constellations visible from the Northern Hemisphere.\n",
            "\n",
            "Natural philosophy\n",
            "Natural philosophy has its origins in Greece during the Archaic period (650 BCE – 480 BCE), when pre-Socratic philosophers like Thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause. They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment; for example, atomism was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by Leucippus and his pupil Democritus.\n",

            "Physics in the medieval European and Islamic world\n",
            "The Western Roman Empire fell in the fifth century, and this resulted in a decline in intellectual pursuits in the western part of Europe. By contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire) resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and continued to advance various fields of learning, including physics.In the sixth century Isidore of Miletus created an important compilation of Archimedes' works that are copied in the Archimedes Palimpsest.\n",
            "\n",
            "In sixth century Europe John Philoponus, a Byzantine scholar, questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics and noted its flaws. He introduced the theory of impetus. Aristotle's physics was not scrutinized until Philoponus appeared; unlike Aristotle, who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus relied on observation. On Aristotle's physics Philoponus wrote:But this is completely erroneous, and our view may be corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument. For if you let fall from the same height two weights of which one is many times as heavy as the other, you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend on the ratio of the weights, but that the difference in time is a very small one. And so, if the difference in the weights is not considerable, that is, of one is, let us say, double the other, there will be no difference, or else an imperceptible difference, in time, though the difference in weight is by no means negligible, with one body weighing twice as much as the otherPhiloponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration for Galileo Galilei ten centuries later, during the Scientific Revolution. Galileo cited Philoponus substantially in his works when arguing that Aristotelian physics was flawed. In the 1300s Jean Buridan, a teacher in the faculty of arts at the University of Paris, developed the concept of impetus. It was a step toward the modern ideas of inertia and momentum.Islamic scholarship inherited Aristotelian physics from the Greeks and during the Islamic Golden Age developed it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and a priori reasoning, developing early forms of the scientific method.\n",
            "The most notable innovations were in the field of optics and vision, which came from the works of many scientists like Ibn Sahl, Al-Kindi, Ibn al-Haytham, Al-Farisi and Avicenna. The most notable work was The Book of Optics (also known as Kitāb al-Manāẓir), written by Ibn al-Haytham, in which he conclusively disproved the ancient Greek idea about vision, but also came up with a new theory. In the book, he presented a study of the phenomenon of the camera obscura (his thousand-year-old version of the pinhole camera) and delved further into the way the eye itself works. Using dissections and the knowledge of previous scholars, he was able to begin to explain how light enters the eye. He asserted that the light ray is focused, but the actual explanation of how light projected to the back of the eye had to wait until 1604. His Treatise on Light explained the camera obscura, hundreds of years before the modern development of photography.\n",
            "\n",
            "The seven-volume Book of Optics (Kitab al-Manathir) hugely influenced thinking across disciplines from the theory of visual perception to the nature of perspective in medieval art, in both the East and the West, for more than 600 years. Many later European scholars and fellow polymaths, from Robert Grosseteste and Leonardo da Vinci to René Descartes, Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, were in his debt. Indeed, the influence of Ibn al-Haytham's Optics ranks alongside that of Newton's work of the same title, published 700 years later.\n",
            "The translation of The Book of Optics had a huge impact on Europe. From it, later European scholars were able to build devices that replicated those Ibn al-Haytham had built, and understand the way light works. From this, such important things as eyeglasses, magnifying glasses, telescopes, and cameras were developed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Classical physics\n",
            "Physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics.Major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the Solar System with the heliocentric Copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies determined by Kepler between 1609 and 1619, pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy by Galileo in the 16th and 17th Centuries, and Newton's discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation that would come to bear his name. Newton also developed calculus, the mathematical study of change, which provided new mathematical methods for solving physical problems.The discovery of new laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, and electromagnetics resulted from greater research efforts during the Industrial Revolution as energy needs increased. The laws comprising classical physics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at non-relativistic speeds, since they provide a very close approximation in such situations, and theories such as quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales. However, inaccuracies in classical mechanics for very small objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century.\n",
            "\n",
            "Modern physics\n",
            "Modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max Planck in quantum theory and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations. Classical mechanics predicted a varying speed of light, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism; this discrepancy was corrected by Einstein's theory of special relativity, which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light. Black-body radiation provided another problem for classical physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency; this, along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, led to the theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very small scales.Quantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac. From this early work, and work in related fields, the Standard Model of particle physics was derived. Following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs boson at CERN in 2012, all fundamental particles predicted by the standard model, and no others, appear to exist; however, physics beyond the Standard Model, with theories such as supersymmetry, is an active area of research. Areas of mathematics in general are important to this field, such as the study of probabilities and groups.\n",
            "\n",
            "Philosophy\n",
            "In many ways, physics stems from ancient Greek philosophy. From Thales' first attempt to characterize matter, to Democritus' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the Ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament, and Aristotle's book Physics (an early book on physics, which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view), various Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Physics was known as natural philosophy until the late 18th century.By the 19th century, physics was realized as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on philosophy of science and its \"scientific method\" to advance our knowledge of the physical world. The scientific method employs a priori reasoning as well as a posteriori reasoning and the use of Bayesian inference to measure the validity of a given theory.The development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers, but has also raised new questions. Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the philosophy of physics, involves issues such as the nature of space and time, determinism, and metaphysical outlooks such as empiricism, naturalism and realism.Many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance Laplace, who championed causal determinism, and Schrödinger, who wrote on quantum mechanics. The mathematical physicist Roger Penrose had been called a Platonist by Stephen Hawking, a view Penrose discusses in his book, The Road to Reality. Hawking referred to himself as an \"unashamed reductionist\" and took issue with Penrose's views.\n",
            "\n",
            "Core theories\n",
            "Though physics deals with a wide variety of systems, certain theories are used by all physicists. Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature. For instance, the theory of classical mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than atoms and moving at much less than the speed of light. These theories continue to be areas of active research today. Chaos theory, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by Newton (1642–1727).\n",
            "These central theories are important tools for research into more specialised topics, and any physicist, regardless of their specialisation, is expected to be literate in them. These include classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, and special relativity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Classical physics\n",
            "Classical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognised and well-developed before the beginning of the 20th century—classical mechanics, acoustics, optics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. Classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by forces and bodies in motion and may be divided into statics (study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration), kinematics (study of motion without regard to its causes), and dynamics (study of motion and the forces that affect it); mechanics may also be divided into solid mechanics and fluid mechanics (known together as continuum mechanics), the latter include such branches as hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, and pneumatics. Acoustics is the study of how sound is produced, controlled, transmitted and received.  Important modern branches of acoustics include ultrasonics, the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing; bioacoustics, the physics of animal calls and hearing, and electroacoustics, the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics.Optics, the study of light, is concerned not only with visible light but also with infrared and ultraviolet radiation, which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. Heat is a form of energy, the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. Electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century; an electric current gives rise to a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current. Electrostatics deals with electric charges at rest, electrodynamics with moving charges, and magnetostatics with magnetic poles at rest.\n",
            "\n",
            "Modern physics\n",
            "Classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale. For example, atomic and nuclear physics studies matter on the smallest scale at which chemical elements can be identified. The physics of elementary particles is on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also known as high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in particle accelerators. On this scale, ordinary, commonsensical notions of space, time, matter, and energy are no longer valid.The two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space, time, and matter from that presented by classical physics. Classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous, while quantum theory is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena. The theory of relativity is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a frame of reference that is in motion with respect to an observer; the special theory of relativity is concerned with motion in the absence of gravitational fields and the general theory of relativity with motion and its connection with gravitation. Both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in all areas of modern physics.\n",

            "Difference between classical and modern physics\n",
            "While physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability.\n",
            "\n",
            "Loosely speaking, the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside of this domain, observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics. Einstein contributed the framework of special relativity, which replaced notions of absolute time and space with spacetime and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light. Planck, Schrödinger, and others introduced quantum mechanics, a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later, quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity. General relativity allowed for a dynamical, curved spacetime, with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described. General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidate theories of quantum gravity are being developed.\n",

            "Relation to other fields\n",
            "Prerequisites\n",
            "Mathematics provides a compact and exact language used to describe the order in nature. This was noted and advocated by Pythagoras, Plato, Galileo, and Newton.\n",
            "Physics uses mathematics to organise and formulate experimental results. From those results, precise or estimated solutions are obtained, quantitative results from which new predictions can be made and experimentally confirmed or negated. The results from physics experiments are numerical data, with their units of measure and estimates of the errors in the measurements. Technologies based on mathematics, like computation have made computational physics an active area of research.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ontology is a prerequisite for physics, but not for mathematics. It means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world, while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, even beyond the real world. Thus physics statements are synthetic, while mathematical statements are analytic. Mathematics contains hypotheses, while physics contains theories. Mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data.\n",
            "The distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example, mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics. Its methods are mathematical, but its subject is physical. The problems in this field start with a \"mathematical model of a physical situation\" (system) and a \"mathematical description of a physical law\" that will be applied to that system. Every mathematical statement used for solving has a hard-to-find physical meaning. The final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.Pure physics is a branch of fundamental science (also called basic science. Physics is also called \"the fundamental science\" because all branches of natural science like chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology are constrained by laws of physics. Similarly, chemistry is often called the central science because of its role in linking the physical sciences. For example, chemistry studies properties, structures, and reactions of matter (chemistry's focus on the molecular and atomic scale distinguishes it from physics). Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other, properties include physical characteristics of given substances, and reactions are bound by laws of physics, like conservation of energy, mass, and charge. Physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine.\n",
            "\n",
            "Application and influence\n",
            "Applied physics is a general term for physics research, which is intended for a particular use. An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.\n",
            "The approach is similar to that of applied mathematics. Applied physicists use physics in scientific research. For instance, people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics.\n",
            "Physics is used heavily in engineering. For example, statics, a subfield of mechanics, is used in the building of bridges and other static structures. The understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert halls; similarly, the use of optics creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators, video games, and movies, and is often critical in forensic investigations.\n",
            "With the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty. For example, in the study of the origin of the earth, one can reasonably model earth's mass, temperature, and rate of rotation, as a function of time allowing one to extrapolate forward or backward in time and so predict future or prior events. It also allows for simulations in engineering that drastically speed up the development of a new technology.\n",
            "But there is also considerable interdisciplinarity, so many other important fields are influenced by physics (e.g., the fields of econophysics and sociophysics).\n",

            "Scientific method\n",
            "Physicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a physical theory. By using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn from its related experiments and observations, physicists are better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical, unbiased, and repeatable way. To that end, experiments are performed and observations are made in order to determine the validity or invalidity of the theory.A scientific law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of some theory, such as Newton's law of universal gravitation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Theory and experiment\n",
            "Theorists seek to develop mathematical models that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future experimental results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although theory and experiment are developed separately, they strongly affect and depend upon each other. Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimental results defy explanation by existing theories, prompting intense focus on applicable modelling, and when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions, which inspire the development of new experiments (and often related equipment).Physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called phenomenologists, who study complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to a fundamental theory.Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy; electromagnetism was unified this way. Beyond the known universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues, such as parallel universes, a multiverse, and higher dimensions. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories; they then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.\n",
            "Experimental physics expands, and is expanded by, engineering and technology. Experimental physicists who are involved in basic research, design and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and lasers, whereas those involved in applied research often work in industry, developing technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transistors. Feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas that have not been explored well by theorists.\n",
            "\n",
            "Scope and aims\n",
            "Physics covers a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particles (such as quarks, neutrinos, and electrons) to the largest superclusters of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore, physics is sometimes called the \"fundamental science\". Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to root causes, and then connect these causes together.\n",
            "For example, the ancient Chinese observed that certain rocks (lodestone and magnetite) were attracted to one another by an invisible force. This effect was later called magnetism, which was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. But even before the Chinese discovered magnetism, the ancient Greeks knew of other objects such as amber, that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two. This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called electricity. Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force—electromagnetism. This process of \"unifying\" forces continues today, and electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are now considered to be two aspects of the electroweak interaction. Physics hopes to find an ultimate reason (theory of everything) for why nature is as it is (see section Current research below for more information).\n",

            "Research fields\n",
            "Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; condensed matter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; astrophysics; and applied physics. Some physics departments also support physics education research and physics outreach.Since the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialised, and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. \"Universalists\" such as Einstein (1879–1955) and Lev Landau (1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.The major fields of physics, along with their subfields and the theories and concepts they employ, are shown in the following table.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nuclear and particle physics\n",
            "Particle physics is the study of the elementary constituents of matter and energy and the interactions between them. In addition, particle physicists design and develop the high-energy accelerators, detectors, and computer programs necessary for this research. The field is also called \"high-energy physics\" because many elementary particles do not occur naturally but are created only during high-energy collisions of other particles.Currently, the interactions of elementary particles and fields are described by the Standard Model. The model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter (quarks and leptons) that interact via the strong, weak, and electromagnetic fundamental forces. Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging gauge bosons (gluons, W and Z bosons, and photons, respectively). The Standard Model also predicts a particle known as the Higgs boson. In July 2012 CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, announced the detection of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson, an integral part of a Higgs mechanism.\n",
            "Nuclear physics is the field of physics that studies the constituents and interactions of atomic nuclei. The most commonly known applications of nuclear physics are nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons technology, but the research has provided application in many fields, including those in nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging, ion implantation in materials engineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology.\n",
            "\n",
            "Atomic, molecular, and optical physics\n",
            "Atomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO) is the study of matter–matter and light–matter interactions on the scale of single atoms and molecules. The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of their relevant energy scales. All three areas include both classical, semi-classical and quantum treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).\n",
            "Atomic physics studies the electron shells of atoms. Current research focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions, low-temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics. Atomic physics is influenced by the nucleus (see hyperfine splitting), but intra-nuclear phenomena such as fission and fusion are considered part of nuclear physics.\n",
            "Molecular physics focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light. Optical physics is distinct from optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental properties of optical fields and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.\n",
            "\n",
            "Condensed matter physics\n",
            "Condensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter. In particular, it is concerned with the \"condensed\" phases that appear whenever the number of particles in a system is extremely large and the interactions between them are strong.The most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids, which arise from the bonding by way of the electromagnetic force between atoms. More exotic condensed phases include the superfluid and the Bose–Einstein condensate found in certain atomic systems at very low temperature, the superconducting phase exhibited by conduction electrons in certain materials, and the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices.Condensed matter physics is the largest field of contemporary physics. Historically, condensed matter physics grew out of solid-state physics, which is now considered one of its main subfields. The term condensed matter physics was apparently coined by Philip Anderson when he renamed his research group—previously solid-state theory—in 1967. In 1978, the Division of Solid State Physics of the American Physical Society was renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics. Condensed matter physics has a large overlap with chemistry, materials science, nanotechnology and engineering.\n",
            "\n",
            "Astrophysics\n",
            "Astrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of stellar structure, stellar evolution, the origin of the Solar System, and related problems of cosmology. Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.The discovery by Karl Jansky in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of radio astronomy. Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations and interference from the earth's atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for infrared, ultraviolet, gamma-ray, and X-ray astronomy.\n",
            "Physical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century, Hubble's discovery that the universe is expanding, as shown by the Hubble diagram, prompted rival explanations known as the steady state universe and the Big Bang.\n",
            "The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the cosmological principle. Cosmologists have recently established the ΛCDM model of the evolution of the universe, which includes cosmic inflation, dark energy, and dark matter.\n",
            "Numerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of the universe. In particular, the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possible over the next several years. Fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles, complementing similar experiments with the Large Hadron Collider and other underground detectors.\n",
            "IBEX is already yielding new astrophysical discoveries: \"No one knows what is creating the ENA (energetic neutral atoms) ribbon\" along the termination shock of the solar wind, \"but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of the heliosphere—in which the Solar System's enveloping pocket filled with the solar wind's charged particles is plowing through the onrushing 'galactic wind' of the interstellar medium in the shape of a comet—is wrong.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Current research\n",
            "Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.\n",
            "In condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of high-temperature superconductivity. Many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable spintronics and quantum computers.In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model have begun to appear. Foremost among these are indications that neutrinos have non-zero mass. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing solar neutrino problem, and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. The Large Hadron Collider has already found the Higgs boson, but future research aims to prove or disprove the supersymmetry, which extends the Standard Model of particle physics. Research on the nature of the major mysteries of dark matter and dark energy is also currently ongoing.Theoretical attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity into a single theory of quantum gravity, a program ongoing for over half a century, have not yet been decisively resolved. The current leading candidates are M-theory, superstring theory and loop quantum gravity.\n",
            "Many astronomical and cosmological phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily explained, including the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, the baryon asymmetry, the accelerating expansion of the universe and the anomalous rotation rates of galaxies.\n",
            "Although much progress has been made in high-energy, quantum, and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving complexity, chaos, or turbulence are still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling water, the shape of water droplets, mechanisms of surface tension catastrophes, and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern mathematical methods and computers, which enabled complex systems to be modeled in new ways. Complex physics has become part of increasingly interdisciplinary research, as exemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of pattern formation in biological systems. In the 1932 Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, Horace Lamb said:\n",
            "I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.\n",

            "Tensor networks or tensor network states are a class of variational wave functions used in the study of many-body quantum systems.  Tensor networks extend one-dimensional matrix product states to higher dimensions while preserving some of their useful mathematical properties.The wave function is encoded as a tensor contraction of a network of individual tensors.  The structure of the individual tensors can impose global symmetries on the wave function (such as antisymmetry under exchange of fermions) or restrict the wave function to specific quantum numbers, like total charge, angular momentum, or spin.  It is also possible to derive strict bounds on quantities like entanglement and correlation length using the mathematical structure of the tensor network.  This has made tensor networks useful in theoretical studies of quantum information in many-body systems.  They have also proved useful in variational studies of ground states, excited states, and dynamics of strongly correlated many-body systems.\n",

            "\n",
            "Tensor networks have been adapted for supervised learning, taking advantage of similar mathematical structure in variational studies in quantum mechanics and large-scale machine learning.  This crossover has spurred collaboration between researchers in artificial intelligence and quantum information science.  In June 2019, Google, the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and X (company), released TensorNetwork, an open-source library for efficient tensor calculations.\n",

              "{'200 (South Park)': '\"200\" is the fifth episode of the fourteenth season of the American animated television series South Park, and the 200th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 14, 2010. In the episode, Tom Cruise and all other celebrities who have been mocked by residents of South Park in the past plan to file a class action lawsuit against the town, but Cruise promises to end the lawsuit if the town can get the Islamic prophet Muhammad to meet him.\\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. To celebrate their landmark episode, Parker and fellow series co-creator Matt Stone combined many of South Park\\'s past storylines and controversies. The Muhammad subplot, similar to the one previously featured in the season 10 episode \"Cartoon Wars\", refers to Comedy Central\\'s past refusal to allow images of Muhammad to be shown on the network in response to the riots and threats generated from controversial cartoons in 2005 and 2007 of Muhammad in European newspapers.\\n\"200\" includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes, including Cruise, Rob Reiner, Steven Spielberg, Kanye West, Paris Hilton, George Lucas, Mel Gibson and Barbra Streisand. An additional subplot includes Cartman learning he may not know the true identity of his father. The season 2 episode \"Cartman\\'s Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\" claimed that Cartman\\'s hermaphrodite mother is his father, but the events of \"200\" and the subsequent episode reveal that this is not the case.\\n\"200\" received mostly positive reviews. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 3.33 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night. Both \"200\" and the sequel episode \"201\" were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010.\\nWithin a week of the episode\\'s original broadcast date, the website for the radical Muslim organization Revolution Muslim posted an entry warning Parker and Stone that they risked being murdered for airing the episode, which several media outlets and observers interpreted as a threat. As a result, Comedy Central heavily censored portions of \"201\" by removing references to Muhammad and the episode\\'s closing speech. The episode was rated TV-MA L in the United States.\\n\\nPlot\\nWhile on a school field trip to a candy factory, Butters spots actor Tom Cruise working there, packing fudge into boxes. Stan, who previously told Cruise that his acting is not as good as others\\' in \"Trapped in the Closet\", accidentally insults him again by calling him a \"fudge packer\", as Cruise claims to be fly fishing. Cruise then recruits 200 other celebrities who have been ridiculed by the town of South Park to bring a class action lawsuit against the town. Stan returns to the factory with his father Randy to try to apologize and convince Cruise to drop the suit, but also finds it difficult not to call him a fudge packer as well since he was literally packing fudge while they spoke. An angry Cruise agrees to do so, but only if they can help Cruise meet Muhammad. This causes an uproar because depictions of Muhammad are forbidden, and the townsfolk fear that forcing Muhammad to appear in public will drive Muslim radicals to bomb the town. Stan and Kyle go to the Super Best Friends, a squad of superhero-like religious figures (Jesus Christ, Gautama Buddha, Moses, Krishna, Laozi, Joseph Smith and \"Seaman\") of which Muhammad is a member, to request he return with them to South Park. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Cruise and the other celebrities only want Muhammad for his \"goo\", as Rob Reiner, previously shown to be filled with \"goo\" in \"Butt Out\", has invented a machine to transfer Muhammad\\'s \"goo\" to the celebrities, which they believe will make them immune to ridicule, just like Muhammad.\\nBy this time, Cartman arrives with \"Mitch Conner\", a face painted on his hand as one-half of a ventriloquist act. Previously, Connor had successfully impersonated actress Jennifer Lopez in \"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\", and now Cartman and Connor return to the Lopez imitation in order to get involved in the lawsuit along with the other celebrities. Connor soon secretly convinces Cartman that they should steal Muhammad\\'s goo for themselves to sell on the black market for more than the lawsuit could offer. Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan convince the Super Best Friends to let Muhammad come to town, but only if he stays in the back of a U-Haul truck and is not seen. When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise\\'s limo, they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit. South Park is about to give Muhammad to the celebrities when the exchange is interrupted by a bomb planted by the Ginger Kids, a group of fair-skinned, red-haired children who are tired of being made fun of for their physical appearance.  The Gingers want Muhammad for themselves, hoping to use his goo for their own means. They threaten to blow up the town if Muhammad is not turned over to them.\\nThe people of South Park decide to turn Muhammad over to the Gingers, fearing the violence that will befall their town if they do not. The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt Mecha-Streisand, a giant mechanical monster form of Barbra Streisand, who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. The celebrities hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor\\'s scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his hermaphroditic mother was his father, Connor insists this is a lie. Cartman confronts his school teacher Mr. Garrison and Garrison\\'s old hand puppet Mr. Hat, who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha-Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction as the episode ends on a cliffhanger, setting the stage for 201.\\n\\nProduction\\nWritten and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, \"200\" was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 14, 2010. It was the 200th episode of the series. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone conceive, write and produce most South Park episodes within a week of their broadcast date in order to maintain a sense of energy and timeliness. The idea for \"200\", however, was conceived before the fourteenth season began in March 2010, and before any of the season fourteen episodes that preceded it were conceived. While trying to decide how to celebrate the 200th episode, Parker and Stone started reviewing the plots and controversies of previous episodes, many of which had a common thread of mocking a particular celebrity. This led to the idea of the having all the celebrities band together in a class action lawsuit against the town. Parker said their reactions mirrored the real-life reactions some of the celebrities had to their portrayals, adding, \"If they could join forces, they probably would.\"Stone said in writing the episode, they were determined not to produce a clip show, but to merge all of the old ideas into a new, original script. The process proved challenging for the duo because it involved incorporating many ideas, subplots and characters into a single episode. Parker and Stone included a joke about this process at the start of the episode, when Cartman and Kyle are fighting with each other, and Stan accuses them of just \"rehashing a bunch of old stuff\". In honor of the 200th episode, the website SouthPark200.com was launched, offering a forum to fans to post their congratulations to South Park and view those posted by others. Various people have contributed to the site, including the creators of the animated series The Simpsons (who used the opportunity to revisit another previous South Park theme, the episode \"Simpsons Already Did It\", saying \"We already [produced 200 episodes]. Twice.\"), members of the rock band Rush and Denver Nuggets basketball player Chauncey Billups. The site also includes congratulations from All in the Family creator Norman Lear, who guest-starred in the 100th episode \"I\\'m a Little Bit Country\", and figure skater Brian Boitano, who was featured in the song \"What Would Brian Boitano Do?\" in the 1999 film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.\\n\\nTheme\\nMuhammad subplot\\n\"200\" features jokes and references to past South Park episodes, storylines, characters and controversies. The episode revolves heavily around efforts to bring Muhammad into public view. This is based on two past controversies in 2005 (Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy) and 2007 (Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, which was responded to with reactions of violent riots, global protests and death threats toward the artists. As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad whatsoever, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise\\'s efforts to harvest Muhammad\\'s apparent immunity to satire and ridicule. Parker and Stone addressed the Muhammad issue in their two-part tenth season episode \"Cartoon Wars\", during which they attempt to show an image of the prophet, only to reveal that Comedy Central has forbidden any such image from being broadcast on their network. However, Muhammad had already been featured on-screen in the fifth season episode \"Super Best Friends\", in which he is among a band of religious figures modeled after the superheroes in the Super Friends cartoons from the 1970s and 1980s. (The Super Best Friends are featured once again in \"200\".) The episode \"Super Best Friends\" aired in 2001, before the Jyllands-Posten and Vilks controversies. Stan makes reference to that past use of Muhammad\\'s image in \"200\" by saying of Muhammad, \"I saw him once...a while ago...\" This reference was purposely included to reflect the irony that an image that was previously not a problem had suddenly become an issue due to new circumstances. Stone said, \"Something that was OK is now not OK, and that\\'s just fucked up.\" The \"Super Best Friends\" episode continues to be run uncensored by Comedy Central in repeats, even though new images of Muhammad remained prohibited.Additionally, Muhammad has long been featured as one of the many characters shown in an image of dozens of South Park residents during the show\\'s opening credits. That image, however, has gone largely unnoticed, and thus has not drawn much controversy. When asked whether they feared retribution for mocking Muhammad, Parker said, \"We\\'d be so hypocritical against our own thoughts, if we said, \\'Okay, well let\\'s not make fun of them because they might hurt us. Okay, we\\'ll rip on the Catholics because they won\\'t hurt us, but we won\\'t rip on [Muslims] because they might hurt us.\\'\" The Muhammad subplot in \"200\", like the \"Cartoon Wars\" episodes, advocates for free speech and speaks out against censorship, both of Muhammad\\'s image and any subject considered taboo. \"200\" also demonstrates the double standard in the handling of offensive images of Muhammad and other religious figures, particularly in the scene in which Muhammad is censored altogether, but Buddhism founder Gautama Buddha is shown snorting cocaine in front of the South Park children. The extreme measures the South Park boys go to in order to conceal Muhammad, like hiding him in a window-less truck and dressing him as a mascot, demonstrate the absurdity of the fear in showing the prophet, as does the fear of retaliation that the South Park residents show after Randy draws a stick figure-like drawing of him, which is not censored.\\n\\nCelebrities\\n\"200\" includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes. One of the most prominently parodied is Tom Cruise, who was the center of the ninth season episode \"Trapped in the Closet\". Cruise spent much of that episode hiding in a closet, a reference to rumors about his sexuality. In \"200\", he is found working in a fudge factory as a \"fudge packer\", a reference to alleged homosexuality. The episode also reveals Cruise\\'s house consists mostly of closets, a reference to both homosexuality and the original episode in which Cruise was mocked. Other celebrities mocked in \"200\" include:\\n\\nActor Ben Affleck (\"How to Eat with Your Butt\", \"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\")\\nFilm director Michael Bay (\"Imaginationland Episode I\", Cartmanland)\\nPope Benedict XVI (\"Bloody Mary\", \"Fantastic Easter Special\")\\nal-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden (\"Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants\")\\nMagician David Blaine (\"Super Best Friends\")\\nU2 vocalist Bono (\"More Crap\")\\nSinger/songwriter Jimmy Buffett (\"Tonsil Trouble\")\\nPolitician Hillary Clinton (\"The Snuke\")\\nLawyer Johnnie Cochran (\"Chef Aid\")\\nSinger/songwriter Phil Collins (\"Timmy 2000\")\\nPolitician Gary Condit (\"Butters\\' Very Own Episode\")\\nComedian Bill Cosby (\"Trapper Keeper\", \"Here Comes the Neighborhood\", \"Clubhouses\")\\nActor Russell Crowe (\"The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer\")\\nActor Michael Douglas (\"Sexual Healing\")\\nActor David Duchovny (\"Sexual Healing\")\\nSubway spokesman Jared Fogle (\"Jared Has Aides\")\\nFilm character Indiana Jones (\"The China Probrem\")\\nActor Mel Gibson (\"The Passion of the Jew, Imaginationland\")\\nTelevision host Kathie Lee Gifford (\"Weight Gain 4000\")\\nSocialite Paris Hilton (\"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset\")\\nWildlife expert Steve Irwin (\"Hell on Earth 2006\", \"Prehistoric Ice Man\")\\nPolitician Jesse Jackson (\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\")\\nSinger Michael Jackson (\"Dead Celebrities, The Jeffersons\")\\nActress Angelina Jolie (\"Lice Capades\")\\nTalk show host David Letterman (\"Sexual Healing\")\\nFilm director George Lucas (\"Free Hat\", \"The China Probrem\")\\nActress Liza Minnelli (\"Freak Strike\")\\nDisney mascot Mickey Mouse (\"The Ring\")\\nActress and television host Rosie O\\'Donnell (\"Trapper Keeper\")\\nSinger and activist Yoko Ono (\"World Wide Recorder Concert\")\\nActress Sarah Jessica Parker (\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\")\\nActor and film director Robert Redford (\"Chef\\'s Chocolate Salty Balls\")\\nFilm director Rob Reiner (\"Butt Out\")\\nActor Michael Richards (\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\")\\nActress Winona Ryder (South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut)\\nActor and television host Bob Saget (\"Cartman\\'s Mom Is a Dirty Slut\")\\nActor Fred Savage (\"Chef\\'s Chocolate Salty Balls\")\\nActor Charlie Sheen (\"Sexual Healing\")\\nActress Brooke Shields (South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut)\\nFilm director M. Night Shyamalan (\"Imaginationland Episode I\")\\nActor and retired football player O. J. Simpson (\"Butters\\' Very Own Episode\")\\nActor and rapper Will Smith (\"Here Comes the Neighborhood\")\\nFilm director Steven Spielberg (\"Cripple Fight\", \"Free Hat\", \"The China Probrem\")\\nSinger Britney Spears (\"Britney\\'s New Look\")\\nTelevision host Martha Stewart (\"Eat, Pray, Queef\", \"Red Hot Catholic Love\")\\nActress Sally Struthers (\"Starvin\\' Marvin,\" \"Mecha-Streisand,\" \"Starvin\\' Marvin in Space,\" \"The Death of Eric Cartman\")\\nActor Billy Bob Thornton (\"Sexual Healing\")\\nActor John Travolta (\"The Entity\", \"Trapped in the Closet\")\\nAnimal rights/Environmental activist Paul Watson (\"Whale Whores\")\\nRapper Kanye West (\"Fishsticks\")\\nTalk show host Oprah Winfrey (\"Here Comes the Neighborhood\", \"A Million Little Fibers\")\\nGolf pro Tiger Woods (\"Sexual Healing\")Near the end of \"200\", the celebrities seek assistance from singer and actress Barbra Streisand, who resembles a giant two-legged mechanical monster. This is a reference to Streisand\\'s appearance in the first-season episode \"Mecha-Streisand\", in which she transforms into a monster in the style of Mechagodzilla from the Godzilla franchise. The Mecha-Streisand featured in \"200\" is designed with more sophisticated computer imagery than the original, which was a simple cut-out style cartoon like the rest of South Park. Although Parker and Stone have maintained that most of the celebrities they mock in South Park are chosen at random, with no personal animosity behind it, Barbra Streisand is one of the few they actively and vehemently dislike. Streisand, in turn, has been critical of South Park and her portrayal in it, and has accused the show of adding \"to the cynicism and negativity in our culture, especially in children\".\\n\\nCartman\\'s father\\nThe episode ends with a cliffhanger involving Cartman\\'s father. The identity of Cartman\\'s father made up a major plot point at the end of the first season, culminating in the second season episode \"Cartman\\'s Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\", in which it is revealed Cartman\\'s mother, Liane Cartman, is a hermaphrodite and, in fact, is Cartman\\'s father. \"200\" is the first episode to return to the matter and suggest this was not the actual truth. Throughout the episode, Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner, who had, presumably, just been made up by Cartman in trying to fool Kyle in the seventh-season episode \"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\", resuming his role in pretending to be Jennifer Lopez and utilizing many offensive Hispanic stereotypes in his portrayal of her. The hand puppet portrayal is very similar to the work of Spanish ventriloquist Señor Wences.Several other references to previous South Park episodes are featured throughout \"200\". It marks the reappearance of Mr. Hat, a hand puppet that had been frequently used by Mr. Garrison during the early South Park seasons, but had long been abandoned in later episodes. During the second half of \"200\", an army of red-haired \"ginger kids\" attempt to capture Muhammad themselves. Several South Park episodes, most prominently the ninth-season episode \"Ginger Kids\", have featured the ginger kids, which are children with fair skin, freckles and red hair. In most cases, they have been made the subject of ridicule by Cartman, who views them in an offensively stereotypical way.\\n\\nCultural references\\nDuring one scene, a frustrated Tom Cruise angrily jumps up and down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films. This is a reference to the twelfth season episode \"The China Probrem\", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should \"just have sex with him [Johnny Depp] already\". Cartman\\'s Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell, particularly enchiritos, which is one of the many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character.  Also, when the celebrities are discussing whom to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as \"her,\" to which the discussion goes \"her who?\" \"her\" \"oh...her.\"  This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks \"what did I ever do to you\" and Rick answers \"it wasn\\'t what you did to me, it was what you did to her\" Steve: \"her? oh...her\"\\n\\nReception\\nRatings\\nIn its original American broadcast on April 14, 2010, \"200\" was watched by 3.33 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night. It outperformed the previous week\\'s episode, \"You Have 0 Friends\", which was seen by 3.07 million viewers, and it was seen by roughly 177,000 more viewers than its closest competitor on April 14, USA Network\\'s In Plain Sight. The episode received an overall 2.0 rating/3 share, meaning that it was seen by 2% of the population, and 3% of people watching television at the time of the broadcast. Among viewers between ages 18 and 49, it received a 1.9 rating/5 share, and among male viewers between 18 and 34, it received a 3.7 rating/13 share.\\n\\nReviews\\nThe episode received mostly positive reviews. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said he was surprised by the complexity of \"200\" and the amount of South Park references and subplots it encompassed, especially the questions over Cartman\\'s father. Tucker praised the episode, and said, \"With jokes raining down like hell-fire, the 200th episode spared no one except the South Park kids themselves.\" Ramsey Isler of IGN said it was fun to identify all the references to past South Park moments, but felt \"200\" itself didn\\'t stand out as a great episode. Isler said the new material wasn\\'t very funny, and that the rehashed material was not as funny as the first time they were shown, which was disappointing due to the hype surrounding the episode. The A.V. Club writer Sean O\\'Neal said the episode was funny, but that the original material was far outnumbered by rehashed jokes. O\\'Neal said the use of all the celebrities demonstrated how South Park had been more original in early episodes, but now had \"morph[ed] into something whose default mode is mocking famous people in the news\".Douglas Murray of The Daily Telegraph said of the episode, \"I can\\'t recommend it enough\", and particularly complimented the episode scenes with Buddha snorting cocaine and the South Park townspeople hiding Muhammad. Murray said, \"They make the point about the absurd self-censorship and thuggish intimidation surrounding the Islamic faith better than anything else I\\'ve seen.\" Amy Duncan of Metro said it \"certainly was an episode to remember\". Duncan praised the story, which she said \"develops with [South Park\\'s] usual rude inferences and below-the-belt remarks\". Ryan Broderick of The Hofstra Chronicle said the episode \"came together so simply, so smoothly, and so hilariously that it forgives the last couple lame duck episodes of the season\". Broderick said it avoided the pitfalls of most landmark episodes by providing an original story in addition to the throwback references. Nick Zaino of TV Squad said the episode did not offer much new, but also offer good throwbacks and celebrity spoofs, and didn\\'t \"pull any punches\". Zaino said the episode has \"a wonderful sense of the absurd\", particularly through the use of Mecha-Streisand and Cartman\\'s hand-puppet.The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights and advocacy group, said they were aware of the depiction of Muhammad in \"200\", but declined to put out a formal statement about it because they did not want to draw any more attention to the show. The group\\'s spokesman, Ibrahim Hooper, said, \"People are pretty tired of this whole \\'Let\\'s insult the prophet Muhammad thing.\\'\"\\n\\nRevolution Muslim entry\\nThe website for the organization Revolution Muslim, a New York-based organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk retribution for their depictions of Muhammad. It said that they would \"probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show.\" Filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered by an Islamist in 2004 for making a short documentary on the violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles. The author of the post, Zachary Adam Chesser (who preferred to be called Abu Talhah al Amrikee), said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest.\\nThe entry included audio clips of a sermon by al-Qaeda imam Anwar al-Awlaki, calling for the assassination of anyone who has defamed Muhammad, saying, \"Harming Allah and his messenger is a reason to encourage Muslims to kill whoever does that.\" It also included a link to a 2009 Huffington Post article that gave details of Stone and Parker\\'s mansion in Colorado, and images of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an activist writer and critic of Islam, who lives in permanent security protection because of threats. Comedy Central declined to comment on the post. Before writing the Revolution Muslim post, Chesser wrote an April 15 entry on his Twitter page: \"May Allah kill Matt Stone and Trey Parker and burn them in Hell for all eternity. They insult our prophets Muhammad, Jesus, and Moses.\" Chesser was subsequently sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for this and other offenses.\\nDespite Chesser\\'s statements that the website entry was a warning, several media outlets and observers interpreted it as a threat. Ayaan Hirsi Ali dismissed claims that the website entry was just a warning, calling it \"an assault on the freedom of expression\" that should not be marginalized or overlooked. She said of the episode, \"The \\'South Park\\' episode of last weekend was not just funny, and it wasn\\'t just witty. [It] addressed an essential piece in the times that we are living. There is one group of people, one religion[,] that is claiming to be above criticism.\" New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said he was aware of the website posting, but said, \"We don\\'t think that this threat, as [it] is currently assessed, rises to a crime right now.\"CNN journalist Anderson Cooper said of the episode, \"You might not like South Park the cartoon. You might think it\\'s offensive. [But] the notion that some radical Islamic group in America would make a threat, even a veiled one, against two men\\'s lives because of it is chilling.\" Fox News commentator Bill O\\'Reilly said he would have advised Parker and Stone not to do the episode out of fear of retaliation: \"On the one hand you do have to admire their courage. But I don\\'t know whether the risk–reward [ratio] is worth it.\" The Daily Telegraph writer Douglas Murray said the entry only gave \"200\" more legitimacy, writing, \"[It] of course just confirms the point that the South Park boys were making. [...] I\\'d have said that was point proved. South Park 1: Islamists 0.\" In an episode of Comedy Central\\'s The Daily Show aired on April 22, 2010, host Jon Stewart went into a ten-minute tirade about the alleged death threats, expressing disgust at the alleged hypocrisy of Revolution Muslim\\'s speech while its members enjoy the American lifestyle and freedom of speech.In response to the Revolution Muslim post, the South Park episode \"201\", which aired the following week and concluded the unresolved storylines from \"200\", was heavily censored by Comedy Central. The channel inserted audio bleeps over all references to Muhammad\\'s name and other portions of dialogue, including the entirety of the ending speech by the show\\'s main characters.The Dutch version of Comedy Central began airing commercials for \"200\" during the week of April 26, with the show scheduled to air on April 30. However, \"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\" was shown instead. When asked about this, a spokesperson for Comedy Central Netherlands said they had reluctantly decided the episode to be pulled, along with the episode \"201\". Neither episode is available on the Dutch South Park Studios website; the same applies to the German website as of May 9, 2010. The Swedish affiliate of Comedy Central also refused to broadcast \"200\" and \"201\" in Sweden:\\nComedy Central has decided not to air these two episodes of South Park. It is a decision we\\'ve made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned number[-]one priority, and therefore we have decided to take these precautionary measures.\\n\\nPossible link to Times Square car bomb attempt\\nOn May 1, 18 days after the episode\\'s original airdate, a failed car bomb attempt was discovered by the New York City Police Department near the eastern corner of 1 Astor Plaza in New York City, on West 45 Street, on a side street near the location of the world headquarters of Viacom, Comedy Central\\'s parent company. Some news outlets reported that police are looking into a possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone, although no such link has yet been established. Such speculation was also fueled by statements from U.S. Congressman Peter T. King, who described as one possible motive \"the whole issue with \\'South Park,\\' which Islamic terrorists were threatening to have retribution for.\" However, King stressed the theory was \"one possibility out of a hundred\". Revolution Muslim has denied any involvement with the incident. Younus Abdullah Muhammed, who runs the group\\'s website, was in Times Square at the time speaking out against President Barack Obama with a loudspeaker. But he said of the failed car bomb, \"What do you think, I commanded somebody to blow up a building in the middle of Times Square? [...] It had nothing to do with the \\'South Park\\' controversy. It was not an attack targeting Viacom.\" NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said of the theory, \"We certainly wouldn\\'t rule that out.\" However, media reports indicated Faisal Shahzad, the suspect arrested in connection with the attempted bombing, had trained for months prior to the first broadcast of \"200.\"\\n\\nSri Lanka ban\\nThe depiction of Buddha snorting cocaine in \"200\" and \"201\", prompted the government of Sri Lanka to ban the entire series outright.\\n\\nDigital censorship\\nThe day after the episode aired, the episode was available for streaming on the site. After a week, like the other Muhammad episodes, it was taken off. The message presented to the user for this episode is \"We apologize that South Park Studios cannot stream this episode.\"  The sequel episode, \"201\", also has not been made available for streaming, but a different message describes an intent to potentially post that episode. Similarly the episode and its sequel are not available to stream or buy on services Netflix, iTunes, Hulu, or Amazon Prime Video.  Furthermore, digital copies of these episodes that were purchased prior to their ban from digital distribution are no longer available for streaming or download.\\nWhen the series was transferred to HBO Max in 2020, it was announced that \"200\" and \"201\" would be 2 of 5 episodes cut from the series, alongside \"Super Best Friends\", \"Cartoon Wars Part I\", and \"Cartoon Wars Part II\". The latter two episodes were not previously censored from digital streaming services.\\n\\nHome release\\nAlthough \"200\" was not currently available on the internet legally, and had not re-aired since April 2010, it was confirmed on February 11, 2011 that \"200\" will be released on DVD. \"200\" along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park\\'s fourteenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011.The version presented on the DVD and Blu-ray is the uncensored version, with Muhammad\\'s name unbleeped, unlike the episode that follows, \"201\", which is presented on disc in its original network censored version. During the commentary in both \"200\" and \"201\" Parker and Stone never mention Muhammad directly, referring to him only as \"the prophet of the Muslim faith\".\\nDespite the package claiming otherwise, both \"200\" and \"201\" were completely omitted from the Region 4  and Region 2 releases.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\"200\" Episode Guide at South Park Studios\\n\"200\" at IMDb\\n\"200\" at TV.com',\n",
              " '201 (South Park)': '\"201\" is the sixth episode of the fourteenth season of South Park, and the 201st overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode, \"200\", in which a group of angry celebrities demand South Park produce the prophet Muhammad. In \"201\", a superhero-like group of religious figures team up to save South Park from the celebrities and their monster Mecha-Streisand, while Eric Cartman learns the true identity of his father.\\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. Like \"200\", it alludes to several past storylines and controversies from previous South Park episodes, especially Comedy Central\\'s refusal to show images of Muhammad on the network following controversies in 2005 and 2007 when cartoons depicting Muhammad ran in European newspapers, resulting in riots and threats. Prior to the broadcast of \"201\", the radical Muslim organization Revolution Muslim posted a warning on their website that Parker and Stone risked being murdered for their depiction of Muhammad. Comedy Central modified Parker and Stone\\'s version of the episode, obscuring all images and bleeping all references to Muhammad—to the effect of disruptively obscuring the entire two-minute moral conclusion of the story. Nevertheless, both \"200\" and \"201\" were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010.The censorship drew strong criticism of Comedy Central. Critics said that the network\\'s action would encourage further threats from radical groups. \"201\" was not shown in repeats, has not been made available on the South Park website, and has not been shown in Sweden, Hungary, Australia or the Netherlands. In most places the episode \"Sexual Healing\" was shown instead of episode 201. In the United Kingdom, some parts were removed, and a short on-screen message appears, stating the outline of the removed parts and \"MTV (on Viva)\" or \"Comedy Central\" \"...has refused to air an image of Muhammad on their network\". According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 3.5 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night.\\nOn January 31, 2014, the original, uncensored version of \"201\" was leaked when it was pulled from the South Park Studios servers and was posted online in its entirety without approval by Comedy Central.\\n\\nPlot\\nThe episode opens with Cartman, as his hand-puppet persona Mitch Conner, narrating a flashback to Connor\\'s 1972 medical discharge from his Vietnam War tour of duty in a parody of a scene from the film Apocalypse Now as the song \"Time of the Season\" by the Zombies plays in the background. Back in the present, Mr. Garrison refuses to reveal the identity of Cartman\\'s father, and instead sends Cartman to Dr. Mephisto. Meanwhile, the Ginger Separatist Movement and the townsfolk are negotiating the handover of Muhammad when Mecha-Streisand begins to attack South Park. Muhammad, who is visually obscured throughout the entire episode by a black box superimposed with the word \"CENSORED\", is taken by Stan, Kyle, and Kenny to Dr. Mephisto\\'s lab. The Gingers arrive and take Muhammad and Cartman captive. The Super Best Friends are called to South Park to help; after their powers fail to subdue Mecha-Streisand, they pacify her by having Krishna adopt the form of Neil Diamond and providing her the opportunity to perform a duet with him.\\nThe Gingers contact the celebrities and offer to share Muhammad in exchange for access to the celebrities\\' \"goo transfer machine\", which transfers Muhammad\\'s power to remain free from ridicule to a target individual. Tom Cruise is the first subjected to the process, gaining a \"CENSORED\" box identical to Muhammad\\'s, but further transfers are interrupted when the Super Best Friends arrive to free their comrade Muhammad. Meanwhile, Cartman is taken to the Ginger lair to meet Scott Tenorman, the Head Ginger. Depicted as a melodramatic madman, Scott has decorated his lair to represent the Chili Con-Carnival in which Cartman gained his revenge on Scott by tricking him into eating his own parents. He reveals to Cartman that they shared the same father, former Denver Broncos player Jack Tenorman, meaning that by his act of revenge against Scott, Cartman had killed his own father and fed him to his half-brother.\\nThe fight between the Super Best Friends, celebrities, and Gingers spills over into the Ginger lair, and Tenorman escapes in the confusion. During the fight, Seaman leaps upon Cruise\\'s back, leading Stan to observe, \"Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back.\" The \"CENSORED\" box over Cruise disappears, and all present continue to make jokes based on the fact that the words \"Seaman\" and \"semen\" sound the same. Cruise questions why they are able to do this, which leads to a monologue from Kyle, Jesus Christ, and Santa Claus explaining that the goo does not exist, and that threatening people with violence is the only true answer. In the censored version, this explanation is completely obscured by a continuous audio bleep.\\nAs the town begins to rebuild following the Mecha-Streisand attack (\"for the 39th time\", according to Mayor McDaniels), Stan, Kyle, and Kenny find Cartman crying – not because he learned that he murdered his father, but because he is \"half-ginger\". Mitch Conner reminds Cartman that he is \"half-Bronco\" as well and tells him that makes him \"pretty cool\" and departs. The boys find Cruise crying for a place in which he can live without fear of mockery. Stan, Kenny and Kyle promise to help Cruise get to such a place. The episode\\'s closing shot is of Cruise\\'s corpse lying on the Moon\\'s surface alongside the corpse of the orca featured in \"Free Willzyx\".\\n\\nProduction\\nWritten and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, \"201\" was rated TV-MA-LV in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode \"200\", the 200th entry of the series. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone decided to celebrate their 200th episode by revisiting several subplots that had been featured throughout the show\\'s 14 seasons. Multiple celebrities have been lampooned throughout the series\\' history, inspiring Parker and Stone to have all the past celebrities join in a class action lawsuit against the town of South Park. The ginger kids—children with fair skin, freckles and red hair—have been featured in several past episodes, where they were ridiculed by Cartman, who views them with prejudice. Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner who originally appeared in the seventh season episode \"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\", in which Cartman pretends his hand is Jennifer Lopez and uses many Hispanic stereotypes in his portrayal of her. Cartman regards Connor as a separate entity and has conversations with him, while Stan and Kyle do not accept this idea at all.\\n\"201\" also included several characters and subplots that were not featured in \"200\", such as the return of Dr. Alphonse Mephisto and Kevin, characters that had not been featured on South Park for about 10 years. Other previously recurring characters made appearances in \"201\", including Mr. Hankey, Big Gay Al, Mr. Slave and Pip Pirrup. Scott Tenorman, and the references to Cartman\\'s murder of Scott\\'s parents, were from the fifth season episode \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\". At the end of \"201\", the dead body of Tom Cruise lies alongside the corpse of a killer whale, a reference to the ninth season episode \"Free Willzyx\", in which the South Park boys help an orca escape a marine amusement park and flee to the moon, believing it to be a paradise. Pip Pirrup, who became a background character after his own eponymous episode and made only two speaking roles after before completely disappearing from the show in Season 11, makes a brief appearance and is killed off when Mecha-streisand steps on him.\\n\\nMuhammad storyline\\nOne of the most prominent storylines from \"200\", which continued into \"201\", was the characters\\' efforts to bring Muhammad into public view. This is based on two past controversies in 2005 (Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy) and 2007 (Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, resulting in riots, global protests, and death threats toward the artists. As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad in any form, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise\\'s efforts to harvest Muhammad\\'s apparent immunity to satire and ridicule. Parker and Stone have previously voiced dissatisfaction that images of Muhammad had been censored on the show despite the fact that his image was shown during the 2001 episode \"Super Best Friends\", without any censorship, before the cartoon controversies began. \"201\" continues the theme from \"200\" that argues against fear and censorship, and calls for support of free speech, both of Muhammad\\'s image and any subject considered taboo.\\n\\nThreats and censorship\\nIn the week between the broadcasts of \"200\" and \"201\", the website for the New York-based radical Muslim organization Revolution Muslim posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risked violent retribution for their depictions of Muhammad. The entry stated that they \"will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show.\" Van Gogh was a filmmaker who was murdered by a man named Mohammed Bouyeri in 2004 for making a short film on violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles. The author of the post, Zachary Adam Chesser, said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest.\\nThe entry included audio clips of a sermon by al-Qaeda imam Anwar al-Awlaki calling for the assassination of anyone who has defamed Muhammad, saying, \"Harming Allah and his messenger is a reason to encourage Muslims to kill whoever does that.\" Subsequently, the website for the organization was hacked, temporarily redirecting web traffic to images of Prophet Muhammad with a bomb on his head and an older Muslim man passionately kissing a young boy.Before \"201\" aired, the New York City Police Department increased security at the Comedy Central headquarters in direct response to the threats. Law enforcement officials said Revolution Muslim itself was \"all talk\" and had never engaged in any actual violence but they were concerned that the website post could inspire violence from others.During the original broadcast of \"201\" on April 21, 2010, all references to Muhammad\\'s name were obscured by audio bleeps. Several other portions of dialogue were also censored, including almost the entirety of three consecutive monologues spoken by Kyle, Jesus and Santa Claus at the end regarding the moral of the episode. Muhammad\\'s name appeared in the previous episode, \"200\", without any such censorship. Both episodes obscured all images of what was apparently Muhammad with a black \"CENSORED\" box. Immediately after the episode \"201\" aired, the series website South Park Studios posted a notice that said Comedy Central had inserted \"numerous additional bleeps throughout the episode\" after Parker and Stone submitted their final cut to the network. The network later confirmed they were responsible for the audio censorship.On April 22, 2010, South Park Studios released a brief statement:\\nIn the 14 years we\\'ve been doing South Park we have never done a show that we couldn\\'t stand behind. We delivered our version of the show to Comedy Central and they made a determination to alter the episode. It wasn\\'t some meta-joke on our part. Comedy Central added the bleeps. In fact, Kyle\\'s customary final speech was about intimidation and fear. It didn\\'t mention Muhammad at all but it got bleeped too. We\\'ll be back next week with a whole new show about something completely different and we\\'ll see what happens to it.\\nSome of these developments had been anticipated in the 2006 South Park episodes \"Cartoon Wars Part I\" and \"Cartoon Wars Part II\". These episodes showed South Park\\'s reaction to a controversy regarding censorship of Muhammad depictions on two (fictional) episodes of Family Guy.\\nIn the United States \"201\" has never re-aired following its original debut as South Park would usually repeat during the week, and episodes from earlier in the season were shown instead. Although South Park Studios generally makes unexpurgated versions of their episodes immediately available to view, the notice indicated Parker and Stone did not have network approval to show their original version, and thus no version of \"201\" could be seen on the website.The Canadian Comedy Network aired \"201\" on April 25, 2010, though the episode was censored as the American broadcast was, breaking the channel\\'s multi-year practice of airing South Park completely uncensored. Neither \"200\" nor \"201\" were shown in the version of Comedy Central in the Netherlands, and neither episode is available on the Dutch South Park Studios website. The Swedish affiliate of Comedy Central also refused to broadcast \"200\" and \"201\" in Sweden, claiming:\\nComedy Central has decided not to air these two episodes of South Park. It is a decision we\\'ve made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned number one priority, and therefore we have decided to take these precautionary measures.\\n\"Super Best Friends\" was also pulled from the South Park Studios site following the increased media attention from \"201\".\\n\\nCultural references\\nDuring Mitch Conner\\'s flashback of the Vietnam War at the beginning of the episode, \"Time of the Season\" by English rock group the Zombies plays in the background. The scenes between Cartman and Scott Tenorman closely mirror a scene from the 1988 graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke where the Joker tortures and taunts  Commissioner Gordon. Mecha-Streisand is defeated by her inability to resist performing duets with Neil Diamond, a pop singer-songwriter. During one scene, Mecha-Streisand crushes a building and someone screams, \"The Casa Bonita is gone!\"  This is the name of a real-life restaurant that had been seen in the episode \"Casa Bonita\", and after which Parker and Stone\\'s production facility was named.\\n\\nReception\\nRatings\\nIn its original American broadcast on April 21, 2010, \"201\" was watched by 3.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night. It outperformed the previous week\\'s episode, \"200\", which was seen by 3.33 million viewers.\\n\\nReviews\\nThe A.V. Club writer Sean O\\'Neal said \"201\" was an improvement over \"200\", but nevertheless felt \"201\" was \"less a cohesive episode than a grab bag of balls-out crazy scenes and cameos only loyal fans would really appreciate.\" However, he also said, \"it\\'s sure to become one of, if not the most talked-about episode of South Park ever.\" Even after Comedy Central announced they were responsible for the censorship in \"201\", he speculated as to whether it was possibly a publicity stunt by Parker and Stone to create controversy and increase viewership. Ramsey Isler of IGN said the episode built on the events of \"200\" and delivered a strong payoff, particularly with the subplot about Cartman\\'s father and the way it tied back to \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\". Isler said the bleeps added by Comedy Central provided some unintentional laughs and underscored the episode\\'s underlying theme opposing censorship.\\n\\nResponse to censorship\\nAccording to a Zogby International survey conducted after \"201\" aired, a majority of Americans opposed Comedy Central\\'s censorship of the episode. 71% disagreed with the network\\'s decision to censor \"201\", with only 19% agreeing with the decision. 47% of those who disagreed with the censorship said they disagreed strongly, with only 5% who agreed claiming they felt strongly. Some commentators suggested because Comedy Central responded to Revolution Muslim\\'s warnings by censoring depictions of Muhammad, the Muslim extremists scored a significant public victory.Michael Cavna of The Washington Post wrote, \"To invoke the revivified phrase: The terrorists win.\" Toronto Sun columnist Mike Strobel pointed out Revolution Muslim is a relatively small group of \"a half-dozen wannabe Osamas\", but said because of Comedy Central\\'s response, \"The loonies and terrorists win one. No doubt, they\\'ll try this stunt again.\" Likewise, Jean Marbella of The Baltimore Sun said, \"It\\'s not even that the terrorists have won, it\\'s that wannabe terrorists have won.\" Margaret Wente of The Globe and Mail said the censorship of \"201\" could be \"the lowest point in the history of American TV\", and that it represented a gravitation toward fear in a post-September 11 attacks world. Los Angeles Times columnist Patrick Goldstein said there were \"no easy answers\" and that he was not surprised Comedy Central took the threat seriously, but added, \"in a democracy, artists and political satirists should be allowed to say what they believe, even if it offends some of its audience\". Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant suggested Comedy Central actually drew more attention to the Muhammad controversy, not less, by censoring the episode. UCLA School of Law Professor Eugene Volokh said Comedy Central\\'s actions risk empowering other extremists:\\nThe consequence of this position is that the thugs win and people have more incentive to be thugs. There are lots of people out there who would very much like to get certain kind of material removed, whether religious or political. The more they see others winning, the more they will be likely to do the same. Behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated.\\nSeventeen Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonists protested the threats in a petition released April 27, 2010. Among the signatures were those of Garry Trudeau, Mark Fiore, Tony Auth, David Horsey and Paul Szep. The petition stated:\\nWe, the undersigned, condemn the recent threats against the creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, by the extremist organization, Muslim Revolution. Freedom of expression is a universal right and we reject any group that seeks to silence people by violence or intimidation. In the United States we have a proud tradition of political satire and believe in the right to speak or draw freely without censorship.\\nDuring the April 22 broadcast of Comedy Central\\'s The Daily Show, host Jon Stewart responded to the censorship of \"201\" with a ten-minute monologue about the death threats, expressing disgust toward Revolution Muslim, culminating with a song telling Revolution Muslim to \"go fuck [themselves]\". Stewart criticized Comedy Central\\'s decision to alter the episode, while simultaneously acknowledging they likely did so to protect their employees from \"possible harmful repercussions\". Bill Maher, host of the HBO talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, said the threats against \"201\" demonstrated the importance of the First Amendment and other American civil liberties, and said, \"When South Park got threatened last week by Islamists incensed at their depiction of Muhammad, it served—or should serve—as a reminder that our culture isn\\'t just different than one that makes death threats to cartoonists. It\\'s better.\" He added jokingly, \"If you don\\'t get that, and you still want to kill someone over a stupid cartoon, please make it Garfield.\"As a result of Revolution Muslim\\'s statement, Seattle cartoonist Molly Norris suggested that many people draw and publish pictures of Muhammad on May 20, 2010, which she dubbed the \"first annual Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\". However, very few cartoonists actually joined her in criticizing Islam or depicting the prophet Muhammed; instead, much like Maher and Stewart, they merely praised her for her efforts and condemned the idea of censorship. Norris herself went into hiding, shortly thereafter, on the advice of the FBI. Animated comedy series Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane voiced this ambivalence on the part of the creative community, saying \"No one is a bigger critic of organized religion than I am\", but nevertheless added, \"It\\'s tricky. You pick your battles. You have to judge how real the threat is against how funny the joke is. How much do I care about the joke?\" And The Simpsons also addressed the apparent hypocrisy of those who claimed to stand with South Park in a chalkboard gag during the opening sequence of the April 25, 2010 episode \"The Squirt and the Whale\", with Bart Simpson writing \"South Park—We\\'d Stand Beside You If We Weren\\'t So Scared\".In a 2016 oral history of South Park in The Hollywood Reporter, Vernon Chatman, the voice of Towelie as well as a writer and producer on the show said that after Comedy Central censored the episode, series co-creator Trey Parker purchased a ticket to South Africa and showed it to the head of the network as a threat because Dave Chappelle had fled to Africa, though Parker never actually went.\\n\\nSri Lanka ban\\nThe depiction of Buddha snorting cocaine in \"200\" and \"201\" prompted the government of Sri Lanka to ban the entire series outright.\\n\\nHome release\\nThe fourteenth season of South Park was released April 26, 2011 to DVD and Blu-ray, including the episode \"201\". When playing the episode, prior to the theme playing, a text card appears saying: \"The following episode appears as it originally aired on April 21, 2010. After it aired Matt Stone and Trey Parker released the following statement\" and then shows the original message that was released after the episode aired. Consequently, Muhammad, his name, and the speeches made by Kyle, Jesus, and Santa are still censored as in the broadcast version. Although the end speeches are still censored, the bleeps are accompanied with music on DVD, unlike the April 21, 2010 airing, which featured a raw audio bleep.\\nIn the episode\\'s audio commentary, Parker only comments on the opening scene, noting that they did the episode as intended and sent it in. He and Stone comment that they are not supposed to talk about it. For the next several moments, a large audio beep obscures the commentary before Stone says \"Yeah, that\\'s pretty much it.\" During the commentary in both \"201\" and \"200\" Parker and Stone never mention Muhammad directly, referring to him only as \"the prophet of the Muslim faith\". Despite the package claiming otherwise, both \"200\" and \"201\" were omitted from the Region 4 release and have been completely omitted from the Region 2 (which contains the predominantly Islamic Middle East and North Africa) release as well.\\n\\nOnline leak of uncensored version\\nOn January 31, 2014, the original uncensored version of this episode was illegally leaked and distributed online without any approval of Comedy Central after a user on 4chan realized that the episode existed on the official website\\'s web server and could be downloaded using rtmpdump.\\nKyle: That\\'s because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we\\'ve all wanted to show things that we weren\\'t allowed to show, but it wasn\\'t because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That\\'s obviously the only true power. If there\\'s anything we\\'ve all learned, it\\'s that terrorizing people works.\\nJesus: That\\'s right. Don\\'t you see, gingers, if you don\\'t want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.\\nSanta: That\\'s right, friends.

              " '2DTV': '2DTV is a British satirical animated television show which was produced by Giles Pilbrow for ITV, and officially premiered on 14 October 2001.\\nThe programme was considered the spiritual successor of the 1980s\\' series Spitting Image, which also involved the work of Pilbrow.The programme also paid homage to the studio Hanna-Barbera in the way the show was animated. The voice cast included the talents of Jon Culshaw, Jan Ravens, and Mark Perry. The programme ran for five series before being axed on 23 December 2004 due to falling viewing figures. It was succeeded, in the spring of 2008, by the short lived series Headcases.The show was first announced in August 2001 as part of the new autumn line up by ITV1. The show was nominated for the Golden Rose of Montreux in March 2002 and again in April 2003.\\n\\nBackground\\n2DTV employed the same satirical style as Spitting Image, but used animation rather than puppets. The animation was produced by using computer graphics, frequently with animators working up to the day of broadcast. The producer for the series, Giles Pilbrow, was one veteran of Spitting Image, as were some of the voice artists on the show.\\nThe series was directed by Tim Searle. 2DTV was first broadcast in March 2001, however an un-broadcast pilot episode was recorded nearly six months beforehand. The pilot episode featured the resident newsreader, played by Alistair McGowan, although his character was not carried over when the full seven part first series was commissioned by ITV. Each episode, in the first series, lasted ten minutes.\\nA seven-episode second series began broadcasting in April 2002, once again with each episode lasting ten minutes. The series spawned its own official single, in July 2002, \"Shoot the Dog\", which was performed by George Michael. The music video for \"Shoot the Dog\" features an animated Michael, plus several other characters from 2DTV, performing the song.One commercial for the home media compilation The Best of 2DTV, was banned by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre in November 2002. The commercial depicted George W. Bush taking one VHS out of its case and putting it in his toaster. Ofcom stated that advertisements for products cannot appear to be endorsed by someone without their permission – in this case, George W. Bush.The original advert was reworked into a sketch in which Bush writes a letter complaining about being portrayed as a moron by the media, then proceeding to \"post\" the letter in his toaster. The programme creators then proposed another commercial, satirising Osama Bin Laden, and were informed that this would also be banned on the grounds that Bin Laden would have to give permission for his image to be used. \\nAnother commercial satirised David Beckham compiling his list for Christmas, asking his wife \"how do you spell DVD?\" The banning was later overturned on the grounds that the commercial was legitimate satire, and the commercial was shown unedited. The programme creators claimed that the controversy generated more interest in the show than the adverts could ever have done alone.For the third series each episode was extended to twenty minutes, including advertisements.\\nAfter the third series many of the original cast members, including Jon Culshaw, Jan Ravens, Mark Perry, decided to depart the series, following an announcement that the fourth series would be extended to thirty minutes per episode. New cast members Lewis MacLeod, Kate O\\'Sullivan, and Enn Reitel took over. They appeared alongside the only remaining original cast member, Dave Lamb. \\nAll four returned for the fifth series at the end of 2004, however, due to falling ratings, its broadcast occurred in the graveyard slot and the show was officially axed in December 2004.\\n\\nCast\\nSeries 1–3\\nJon Culshaw – Tony Blair, Jack Straw, William Hague, John Major, George W.

              " 'Ask the Dust (film)': \"Ask the Dust is a 2006 American-German romantic drama film based on the book Ask the Dust by John Fante. The film was written and directed by Robert Towne. Tom Cruise (with Paula Wagner and Cruise/Wagner Productions) served as one of the film's producers. The film was released on a limited basis on March 17, 2006, and was entered into the 28th Moscow International Film Festival. It was filmed almost entirely in South Africa with the use of stages to portray Los Angeles.\\n\\nPlot\\nThe story is set during the Great Depression, specifically around the time of the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. \\nCamilla (Salma Hayek) is a fiery, beautiful Mexican café waitress who aspires to make something of herself and give her and her future children a place and chance in the world. Arturo (Colin Farrell) is a struggling writer who comes to Bunker Hill, Los Angeles to start his writing career. Though he falls in love with Camilla, he does not marry her. Later, Camilla is infected by tuberculosis and leaves Arturo without informing him. When Arturo finds her, she is about to die and he promises to marry her, but Camilla dies and Arturo writes a novel dedicated to Camilla. Arturo writes a dedication in one of his books to her and throws it into the sand.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nThe rights to the novel once belonged to Mel Brooks, though he let them lapse. Towne met Fante in the 1970s. This meeting led to his interest in the project. Despite finishing the script in the early 1990s, he couldn't find financial backing from a studio. During this time, Farrell's role was originally set to be played by Johnny Depp but he dropped out. Later Val Kilmer accepted the role and also dropped out. Another delay was Hayek initially rejecting the role to avoid being typecast as a Mexican immigrant. She accepted the role after eight years.\\nPart of the film was shot at Pinelands High School (Cape Town, South Africa), on fields modified to simulate a Los Angeles scenery.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nThe film received negative to mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 35% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 104 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 58 out of 100, based on 33 reviews.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nAsk the Dust at IMDb\\nAsk the Dust at Rotten Tomatoes\\nAsk the Dust at Metacritic\\nAsk the Dust at Box Office Mojo\\nAsk the Dust at AllMovie\",\n",
              " 'Being Tom Cruise': '\"The Church of Scientology Presents: Being Tom Cruise, Why Scientology Isn\\'t In Any Way Mental\" is a satirical spoof documentary from the series Star Stories, parodying the life of Tom Cruise and his relationship with the Church of Scientology. It is episode 2 of the second series of Star Stories, and first aired on Channel 4 on 2 August 2007. The show recounts Cruise\\'s time with a group of some of his early acting friends. After filming Top Gun, Cruise (Kevin Bishop) is introduced to Scientology by John Travolta (Steve Edge), who convinces him to join the organization by smashing Cruise over the head with a shovel. He meets Nicole Kidman (Dolly Wells) and they start a relationship. After dating Penélope Cruz, Cruise is introduced to Katie Holmes (Laura Patch) by Travolta. Holmes agrees to marry Cruise, and the program ends with a voiceover asking the viewer to visit a Scientology website and purchase expensive products.\\nThe program received positive reception, and The Guardian and the Evening Times highlighted it as the \"pick of the day\". The Daily Mirror described it as a \"brilliant spoof\", and The Sunday Times characterized the show as \"Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is hard not to be amused\". The Herald Sun called it a \"ruthless but spot-on parody\".\\n\\nPlot\\nThe parody of Tom Cruise (Kevin Bishop) is framed through the viewpoint of the actor\\'s association with the Church of Scientology. The show recounts the actor\\'s days with a group of actors known as the Brat Pack, and how he maintains a friendship with Patrick Swayze, an actor from this crowd. (Brat Pack is a nickname given to a group of young actors and actresses who frequently appeared together in teen-oriented coming-of-age films in the 1980s; Cruise has been referred to as a member due to his role in the film The Outsiders.) While filming Top Gun, Cruise is afraid he looks \"a bit gay\" next to his co-stars. His co-stars subsequently turn into the Village People. Cruise has alien spirit guides who appear as \"a pair of giant blobs who speak with Welsh accents\". They comment on Top Gun, \"It\\'s no ET but it\\'s got something.\" Cruise is introduced to Scientology by John Travolta (Steve Edge), who presents it as a \"legitimate alien-race-based religion\". After Travolta bashes him over the head with a shovel, Cruise remarks: \"Ouch. . . wait a minute. Scientology. It all makes perfect sense now.\" Ewan McGregor tries to convince Cruise to convert to the Jedi methodology.When Cruise first meets Nicole Kidman (Dolly Wells), he asks her to sit down so that he will appear taller. Cruise performs his \"dangling-from-the ceiling routine\" from Mission: Impossible – while in bed with Kidman. Cruise asks Kidman how he can prove he is not gay, and she recommends that they make the film Eyes Wide Shut. Stanley Kubrick is portrayed as a sleazy film director, and the program shows a newspaper headline giving a critical review of Eyes Wide Shut. The show portrays Cruise\\'s relationship with Penélope Cruz, who is seen wearing a mantilla. Travolta introduces Cruise to his third wife Katie Holmes (Laura Patch) who is depicted as a robotic Stepford Wife. \"Greetings, Earth Man, I am here to serve you,\" says Holmes to Cruise upon their first meeting. After Cruise asks Holmes to marry him, she states, \"Affirmative\". The show makes fun of Cruise\\'s couch jumping incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show. (This spoof is in reference to a 2005 appearance by Cruise on the Oprah program, where he \"jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his new girlfriend.\") At the wedding of Cruise and Holmes, an alien bride and groom are displayed on the top of the couple\\'s wedding cake, and the show spoofs the couple\\'s wedding vows. A voiceover at the end of the program tells the viewer to visit scientologyisgreat.com and purchase £4,000 worth of books.\\n\\nProduction\\nProduction on the second series of Star Stories was announced by Channel 4 in January 2007, and in addition to Tom Cruise, others set for parodying included Simon Cowell, Britney Spears and \"the 1990s chart battle between Oasis and Blur\". The show was episode two of the second series of Star Stories. The episode was first broadcast on Channel 4 on 2 August 2007. On its website, Channel 4 promoted the episode with the description, \"Hollywood\\'s smallest actor (after Danny DeVito) expounds on Aliens from Outer Space and the best career choices ever.\" In August 2007, the series was set to be remade into a new version in the U.S.\\n\\nLegal issues\\nMultiple publications commented on the potential legal implications of parodying both Tom Cruise and Scientology. \"Given the Church of Scientology\\'s full-throttle reaction to any criticism or mickey-taking, the Star Stories boys are sure to find themselves in the firing line,\" wrote a reviewer for the Evening Times. A review in The Sunday Times commented, \"Taking their careers in their hands, the Star Stories team tackle the notoriously litigious Tom Cruise ... The lawyers must still be having a nice lie down after watching.\"In an interview with The Northern Echo, Star Stories actor Kevin Bishop discussed the legal issues involved with making the series: \"We\\'re not allowed to say anything about anyone that isn\\'t true. It can be quite tricky. Sometimes we\\'ve had to change lines even when the filming is all finished. We go back to the recording studio and put one line over another line. ... The only reason I reckon we\\'ve not been sued is because actually we\\'ve not said anything that technically we can\\'t.\" He said the series was \"well looked after\" by attorneys. In a 2009 interview with The Independent, Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States: \"I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could be bothered to watch it saw the Tom Cruise one. One guy went \\'you can\\'t do that it\\'s Tom Cruise man? [we’ve done it] \\'yeah but you can\\'t do that on TV\\' [it\\'s already gone out] \\'what you’re talking about Scientology, are you fucking nuts?? [er, look we’ve done it it\\'s been on telly and everyone loved and we\\'ve had no complaints] has Tom Cruise seen this?!\"\\n\\nReception\\nThe Guardian and the Evening Times highlighted the Star Stories parody as the \"pick of the day\". Martin Skeggs of The Guardian commented, \"There\\'s everything you ever wanted to know about the world\\'s number one film star, including how he was introduced to Scientology (John Travolta whacked him over the head with a shovel), the time he met Nicole Kidman and asked her if she would mind sitting down to make him look taller\". He characterized the parody as, \"A toned down version of real life, then.\" Barry McDonald of the Evening Times described the episode as \"equally cruel and sidesplittingly hilarious\". He commented, \"This is as close to must-watch television as you\\'re likely to get and a testament to the quality of comedy writing on display.\" In a later review of the program for the Evening Times when it was shown again on re-runs, McDonald wrote, \"I don\\'t care if it\\'s been shown several times before, this is one of the shows which you just have to see again.\" Anila Baig of The Sun highlighted the show as \"Best Spoof\", and wrote, \"pint-sized Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise  is subjected to some serious mocking. We follow his film career, his marriages to Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes (portrayed as a robot) and how everything in his life has been shaped by his belief in Scientology. The show is as crude as ever\". Stephen Milton of The Sun described the parody of Cruise\\'s appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show as \"the best gag in the whole episode\". Aidan Smith of Scotland on Sunday wrote favorably of the show, and noted, \"Fearlessly, in view of how paranoid Scientologists are, the latest target was Tom Cruise. I especially liked the scene where the tiny screen giant winched himself, Mission Impossible-style, on to Nicole Kidman while she slugged from a tinnie like a good Sheila.\"The Daily Mirror described the program as \"far too funny\". A review in The Daily Mirror was positive, commenting, \"If you want to see a brilliant spoof about Tom Cruise\\'s faith in Scientology and his relationship with Katie Holmes, look no further than C4\\'s Star Stories.\" She commented, \"It\\'s so absurd, even Tom will laugh.\" The Advertiser described Star Stories as \"a surprisingly funny sendup of movie stars and pop groups\", and noted of the episode\\'s title, \"This week\\'s episode is titled Being Tom Cruise  - How Scientology isn\\'t in Any Way Mental, which should give you some idea of the vein of humour mined.\" The Sunday Times observed, \"Just when you thought you might go a week without seeing a mention of brand Beckham, here is a documentary on their best friends, brand Tom Cruise, as recorded by the least reverential writers and least convincing lookalikes on the planet. Scientologists might prefer something on the Sci-fi channel.\" Victoria Segal, Sally Kinnes and Sarah Dempster of The Sunday Times highlighted the episode in their \"Critics\\' Choice\" column. They commented that the show\\'s producers \"[give] their own account of his career, his love life and his religion: It\\'s all about aliens. Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is hard not to be amused\". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun highlighted the program as his \"Top Choice\". Adams commented, \"This ruthless but spot-on parody re-enacts Cruise\\'s life and career through Hollywood gossip, rumour and exaggeration (his father is a midget, Katie Holmes a robot, Nicole Kidman a beer-swilling bogan), but is an antidote to every interview he\\'s ever done.\" Writing for The Newcastle Herald, Anita Beaumont commented, \"This is really silly stuff, but it is amusing enough to enliven a fairly dull night of TV.\" The Sunday Mirror wrote that the program \"was as subtle as a sledge hammer\". Simon Hoggart of The Spectator called the program \"a magnificently over-the-top anti-celebrity festival\".\\n\\nSee also\\nRelationship of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\\nScientology in popular culture\\nTom Cruise: Unauthorized (1998)\\nTom Cruise: All the World\\'s a Stage (2006)\\nTom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography (2008)\\nTrapped in the Closet (South Park)\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\"Star Stories\" The Church of Scientology Presents...

              " 'Cartoon Wars Part II': '\"Cartoon Wars Part II\" is the fourth episode in the tenth season of the American animated television series South Park. The 143rd episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 12, 2006. Following \"Cartoon Wars Part I\", it is the second part of a two-episode story-arc, which focuses on Cartman\\'s efforts to get the television series Family Guy cancelled by exploiting fears of retaliation by Muslims to an upcoming Family Guy episode in which the Islamic prophet Muhammad will appear, in violation of some interpretations of Muslim law. Kyle instead urges the president of Fox, the network airing Family Guy, to air the episode in an exercise of free speech.\\nThe episodes were inspired by the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, which began in response to a Danish newspaper\\'s printing of cartoons depicting Muhammed in early 2006, leading to worldwide protests and occasionally violent demonstrations and riots. It also came from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone\\'s general dislike of Family Guy, which they viewed as overly reliant on cutaway gags for humor and less so on story. During production, the duo ran into reluctance from Comedy Central and parent company Viacom, who felt their insistence to depict Muhammad disregarded concerns for public safety. Parker and Stone argued that the network was giving in to hypothetical violence, labeling them hypocrites due to their satirizing of other religions in the past. The network interference was written into the episode\\'s storyline.\\nComedy Central eventually aired the episode with a black title card during the Muhammad sequence, censoring the depiction. The episode received positive reviews from critics; while the episode\\'s censorship did attract headlines, it received more attention for its lampooning of Family Guy. When the series was transferred to HBO Max in 2020, it was announced that \"Cartoon Wars Part I\" and \"Cartoon Wars Part II\" would be 2 of 5 episodes cut from the series, alongside \"Super Best Friends\", \"200,\" and \"201,\" all of which are episodes featuring Muhammad.\\n\\nPlot\\nEric Cartman has an intense dislike for the television program Family Guy. When he learns that an episode of the show is to feature a depiction of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, he exploits fears of retaliation to urge Fox, the network on which Family Guy airs, to pull the episode. Cartman pretends to be a sickly Danish kid with a broken leg, telling the Fox executives that his father was killed by terrorists during the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and pleading that they pull the Family Guy episode. His story touches the executives, who encourage him to try to persuade the writers to yield. Kyle, who likes Family Guy, arrives at the Fox Studio to foil Cartman\\'s plans, but is knocked unconscious by an ally of Cartman\\'s, a kid resembling Bart Simpson who, also wanting to destroy Family Guy, restrains Kyle in a supply shed.\\nCartman is introduced to the Family Guy writing staff, who turn out to be a group of manatees. The staff, who live in a large tank, pick up \"idea balls\" from a large pile of them, each of which has a different noun, a verb or a pop culture reference written on it, and deliver them, five at a time, to a machine that then forms a Family Guy cutaway gag based on those ideas. The manatees refuse to work if any idea ball is removed from their tank, making censorship an unfeasible practice with them. Cartman secretly removes a ball from their tank, causing them to stop working, and then convinces the Fox president that the manatees are spoiled, and abusing the executives\\' generosity. Cartman convinces the president that they need to show them who\\'s boss. The president decides to pull the new Family Guy episode shortly before airtime. Cartman feels victorious, but Kyle shows up, saying he convinced the Bart-like kid to set him free.\\nAfter a physical altercation between Cartman and Kyle, they both go to the Fox president\\'s office. Kyle tells the president that Cartman has duped him into pulling the episode, and despite Cartman\\'s brandishing of a gun, Kyle implores the president not to censor the episode. The network president ultimately decides, in spite of threats of violence from both Cartman and Islamic terrorists, that Family Guy should be aired, and without censorship. The Family Guy episode airs, and features Muhammad in a cutaway gag, handing Peter Griffin a \"salmon football helmet\", but the scene with Muhammad was cut by Comedy Central, and is replaced by a black screen and a title card reading, \"In this shot, Mohammed hands a football helmet to Family Guy. Comedy Central has refused to broadcast an image of Mohammed on their network.\"\\nTerrorist leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, reminding America that it was warned not to show Muhammad, initiates Al-Qaeda\\'s retaliation — a crudely animated video depicting President George W. Bush, Carson Kressley, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, and Jesus Christ defecating on each other and the American flag. After the video ends, al-Zawahiri gloats of their \"retaliation\" by saying they \"burned\" the Americans and that it \"was way funnier than Family Guy.\"\\n\\nProduction\\nThe episode was largely inspired by the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, in which twelve editorial cartoons, most of which depicted the Islamic prophet Muhammad, were published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, leading to protests around the world in early 2006, including violent demonstrations and riots in some Muslim countries. The duo had wanted to create an episode centering on Muhammad months before that particular controversy flared. Parker gathered the episode\\'s title from a headline on a television news broadcast of the controversy: \"Breaking news: Cartoon wars. Muslims angered over cartoon.\" After the incidents, Parker and Stone wanted to include Muhammad \"just […] standing there\", as a harmless and not overtly offensive depiction. They felt \"100% sure\" that Comedy Central would back them up on their efforts, due to the duo\\'s tendency to tackle serious subjects with humor and satire in the past.The network was \"bummed\" when they learned of their intentions, but nonetheless, as South Park as a franchise made the network exorbitant amounts of money, they could not tell them no. According to Stone, Comedy Central was initially supportive of their vision, but backed away when executives in higher positions at parent company Viacom denied the request. As a result, \"Cartoon Wars Part II\" is largely based around real-life censorship they faced in producing the episode. The duo argued with Comedy Central that refusing to show images of Muhammad would be giving into violence; they were partially fascinated with this territory due to its creation of a new taboo, one informed by threats. In the episode, Kyle\\'s impassioned plea to the president of Fox is culled from Parker and Stone\\'s conversations with Comedy Central executives, and he even refers to the Fox president as \"Doug\", in reference to Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog. The network\\'s reluctance to allow the images to be shown factored into the duo\\'s decision to make the episode a two-parter; \"Well, they’re still not letting us show Muhammed […] we\\'ll argue about it for another week\", said Parker. While the duo agreed that the network had the right to air whatever they want, they viewed their censorship as \"wimpy\".Part of Parker and Stone\\'s anger came from the fact that \"Super Best Friends\", a 2001 episode of South Park, featured images of Muhammad uncensored as a superhero, and aired without censorship for several years on both Comedy Central and in local syndication. The duo struggled to come up with how to present Comedy Central\\'s refusal to broadcast the images as a real situation and not a joke. Parker later related previous South Park episodes, \"Cartman Joins NAMBLA\" (2000) and \"Trapped in the Closet\" (2005), which parodied NAMBLA and Scientology, respectively, as similar situations. \"You have to make sure, when you\\'re doing that kind of subject matter, you want people to know what you\\'re doing is a joke and then what really is real, you know, you\\'re trying to make fun of\", said Parker. The duo, instead of settling on the black title card, toyed with \"putting some really incredible quote up or making a big speech. At the end of the day it felt a little too high and mighty, so we ended up doing the driest thing possible.\"\\n\\nCultural references\\n\"Cartoon Wars Part II\" contains several cultural references. The episode parodies the Fox animated sitcom Family Guy, which was revived from cancellation the previous year and attracted immense popularity. Parker stated, \"we totally understand that people love it, that\\'s why we put it in the show, we understand that it speaks to some people and it can just be a simple laugh and that\\'s great and we certainly don\\'t think it should be taken off the air or anything like that, we just don\\'t respect it in terms of writing\", later referring to the writers behind the show as \"smart\" but emphatically criticizing their overuse of \"gag-humor\".In referencing Family Guy, the episode also brings another Fox television sitcom into the equation: The Simpsons. Following the airing of the episode\\'s first part, the duo received flowers from the producers of The Simpsons and phone calls from those involved with King of the Hill at Fox (who remarked, in reference to their mocking of Family Guy, \"you\\'re doing God\\'s work\"). Parker claimed that the majority of Hollywood at the time disliked the success of Family Guy, both for what was viewed as subpar, lazy writing and for petty, jealous reasons, regarding its high ratings. As Parker and Stone immensely respected The Simpsons, they incorporated the reactions into the episode, with Cartman meeting Bart Simpson, with whom he shares a dislike of Family Guy. The duo also inserted a reference to the staff at King of the Hill. \"There was this animation solidarity moment, where everyone did come together over their hatred of Family Guy\", Parker joked.The episode\\'s opening is self-referential; it is an homage to the controversy that erupted when the duo opened the second season of South Park in 1998 not with the conclusion to the \"Cartman\\'s Mom is a Dirty Slut\" cliffhanger, but with an entirely different, unrelated episode revolving around the show-within-a-show characters Terrance and Phillip (\"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\").\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nDespite the controversy surrounding the image of Muhammad, the episode received high acclaim. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a perfect review, with a score of 10 out of 10, saying, \"The really ironic thing here is that South Park already did show Mohammed prominently, in the \"Super Best Friends\" episode in 2001. Clearly Matt and Trey are also commenting on how times have changed, and how the acts of select extremists can create such specific fears in the powers that be; hammering home their point was the episode\\'s conclusion, which featured terrorists responding to Family Guy with a cartoon of their own, showing Jesus defecating on George W. Bush and the American flag, which pointedly was shown without being censored.\" This episode also won an IGN Editors Choice Award. A 2011 review of the episode from The A.V. Club is part of a series that examines episodes that \"exemplify the spirit of its time and the properties that make television a unique medium\". Noel Murray writes that the episode \"slyly deals with censorship and public pressures of varying degrees—including some that are fairly discreet\".During his \"class day\" address at Harvard University on June 7, 2006, Seth MacFarlane addressed Stone and Parker\\'s criticisms in character as Stewie, stating that the \"...cutaways and flashbacks have nothing to do with the story. They\\'re just there to be \\'funny\\'. That is a shallow indulgence that South Park is quite above, and, for that, I salute them.\"In an interview with Rolling Stone in 2012, Seth MacFarlane called the episode \"funny and accurate\".\\n\\nControversy\\nThe situation became one of life imitating art; in the week prior to the episode\\'s airing, the teaser advertisement referenced the situation: \"Will television executives take a stand for free speech? Or will Comedy Central puss out?\" Comedy Central\\'s decision to censor the image was due to concerns for public safety. The network issued a short statement the day following the episode\\'s airing: “In light of recent world events, we feel we made the right decision.” \"Cartoon Wars\" followed only weeks after another religious run-in with the network, in which Comedy Central pulled a rerun of the season nine episode \"Trapped in the Closet\" due its apparent mocking of Scientology. Stone publicly criticized Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog\\'s decision as \"cowardly\" in Daily Variety.Following the episode\\'s airing, the ending attracted publicity, often misrepresenting and simplifying the segment\\'s theme and message and sensationalizing the appearances of Jesus and President George W. Bush. The episode aired during the Holy Week for Christians, prompting outrage from that community over the portrayal of Jesus. Brent Bozell, founder of the conservative organization Parents Television Council, criticized Viacom for celebrating insults to Christianity through the satirical anti-American scene in this episode, as well as another animated series insulting Catholicism, Popetown, which aired on MTV Germany, another Viacom-owned network. William Anthony Donohue of the Catholic League criticized Stone and Parker. \"The ultimate hypocrite is not Comedy Central — that\\'s their decision not to show the image of Muhammad or not — it\\'s Parker and Stone\", he said. \"Like little whores, they\\'ll sit there and grab the bucks. They\\'ll sit there and they\\'ll whine and they\\'ll take their shot at Jesus. That\\'s their stock in trade.\" In response to these criticisms, Parker and Stone agreed with these groups, noting that while images of Muhammed were forbidden, it instead appeared to be “open season” on Jesus, hence their depiction to illustrate the hypocrisy of the network. The duo subsequently made Donohue a villain in the 2007 episode \"Fantastic Easter Special\".In recent years, the episode has become notorious not for its lampooning of censorship and the Muhammad controversy, but for its criticism of Family Guy. \"You’d think [Muhammad] would be the flashpoint. But no. It’s Family Guy everyone’s talking about (at least, in this hemisphere)\", said Scott Brown of Entertainment Weekly. The duo were disappointed upon their realization that fans cared less about their opinions on censorship and freedom of speech, but rather their fixation on Tom Cruise and the controversy surrounding \"Trapped in the Closet\".Following the episode\\'s broadcast, Harper\\'s Magazine approached the duo to print their uncensored, original image of Muhammad in an issue, but Comedy Central would not approve of the request. \"Harper\\'s is in every Barnes & Noble, every Borders in the country now. I saw it in the airport. It has all the Danish cartoons, and nothing happened. The risks were totally overestimated, I thought\", said Stone.At a Television Critics Association (TCA) discussion in July 2006, Herzog responded to criticism directed at him:\\n\\nI don\\'t feel unlike Matt and Trey to a certain degree. You feel bad, but it\\'s a big judgment call made on behalf of, as Matt said, a big media company. The ramifications are Matt and Trey being pissed at you and Matt calling you a coward in Daily Variety. […] But you know, it\\'s just a tough [situation]. Did we over react? For sure. And I think history will probably show that, we hope. We\\'d like to think. And in a perfect world we would have liked to have done it -- [It was] a judgment call; one of the very few, although there seem to have been a lot over the last six months. Matt and Trey enjoy, I think, a very fair amount of creative freedom. But it really just comes down to a judgment call. And like I said, I think history might show we overreacted, but we\\'re willing to live like that.\\nStone referred to the episode\\'s censorship as \"really, beyond creatively disappointing […] because we thought we could do something really important.\"\\n\\nHome release\\n\"Cartoon Wars Part II\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park\\'s tenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 21, 2007.

However, the termination may have been more about money than anything else. Within a week, Daniel Snyder, owner of the Washington Redskins and two hedge funds, secured financial backing to buy the company.In November 2006, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer came to Cruise/Wagner with a deal that gave them a percentage of the ownership in United Artists in an effort to revive the floundering production company.

              " 'Death Race (film)': 'Death Race is a 2008 American dystopian action thriller film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. It stars Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Ian McShane, and Joan Allen.\\nThough referred to as a remake of the 1975 film Death Race 2000 (which in turn is based on Ib Melchior\\'s short story \"The Racer\") in reviews and marketing materials, director Paul W. S. Anderson stated in the DVD commentary that he thought of the film as something of a prequel.\\nA remake had been in development since 2002, though production was delayed by disapproval of early screenplays, then placed in turnaround following a dispute between Paramount Pictures and the producer duo Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner (the latter was the producer without Cruise in the film). Death Race was acquired by Universal Studios, and Anderson re-joined the project to write and direct. Filming began in Montreal in August 2007, and the completed project was released on August 22, 2008. The film received mixed reviews from critics.\\nThree direct-to-video films in the series were then released: Death Race 2 (2010), Death Race 3: Inferno (2013) and Death Race: Beyond Anarchy (2018).\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 2012, the collapse of the US economy and the subsequent increase in crime rates leads to the rise of privatized prisons. One such prison is Terminal Island Penitentiary, whose warden, Claire Hennessey, earns profits from broadcasting \"Death Race\", a vehicular combat racing series, on the internet. Throughout the season, Terminal Island inmates battle each other in specially modified cars on a track cut into the grounds, with the goal of winning their freedom.\\nTowards the end of a race, a masked driver nicknamed Frankenstein is nearing the finish line, pursued by his rival Machine Gun Joe. His navigator, Case, reports that all of his defensive equipment has malfunctioned. Against her protests, Frankenstein refuses to let Joe finish first. Case ejects herself out of the car just before Joe destroys it as it crosses the finish line.\\nIndustrial worker and ex-con Jensen Ames struggles to support his family. When the steel mill he works at is closed, he returns home to his wife Suzy and their new-born daughter, Piper. A masked assailant knocks him unconscious. Jensen wakes up with a bloodied knife in his hand, Suzy dead nearby, and policemen storming into his home and arresting him. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, while Piper is placed in foster care.\\nSix months later, Jensen is transferred to Terminal Island Prison. Hennessey\\'s right-hand man Ulrich calls Jensen to her office. She tells him that Frankenstein had died from the injuries he received at the end of the previous race, and offers to let Jensen go free if he drives Frankenstein\\'s car to win one more race. Jensen accepts the offer and meets Frankenstein\\'s maintenance crew consisting of Coach, Gunner, and Lists; they explain to Jensen that Hennessey wants him to become Frankenstein to rebuild the profits and audience of \"Death Race\", which has halved since Frankenstein\\'s \"disappearance\".\\nOn the first day of the three day race, Jensen meets Case. During the race his vehicle\\'s defensive equipment again mysteriously malfunctions. Jensen is distracted and blindsided by Joe when he sees Pachenko perform the same hand gesture at him as the masked assailant, causing Jensen to realize it was Pachenko who killed his wife. Jensen confronts Pachenko and attacks him after the race - prompting Pachenko to admit Hennessey ordered him to frame Jensen, so she can have a replacement for Frankenstein. On the second day, Jensen threatens to eject Case unless she tells the truth about the malfunctions. Case admits she sabotaged Frankenstein\\'s car to keep him from winning and leaving Death Race, in exchange for her release papers. Jensen then makes Pachenko\\'s car slam head-on into a concrete barrier, and exits the car to break Pachenko\\'s neck. He and Joe then collaborate to destroy a multi-weapon tanker truck added to boost ratings. By the end of the second race day, all racers except Jensen and Joe are killed. Hennessey orders Ulrich to plant a bomb underneath Jensen\\'s car in case he wins, knowing she can always find another person to impersonate Frankenstein. Jensen, who has realized Hennessey never intended to let anyone win their freedom from the start, approaches Joe after the race, suggesting they talk.\\nOn the final race, Jensen and Joe collaborate again, destroying and driving through a weakened wall. Hennessey activates the bomb, not knowing it was removed and disassembled by Coach. She orders helicopters to pursue, though Jensen jumps out of the car as Case takes his place. Case is captured while Joe and Jensen escape on a freight train. Hennessey later opens a present sent due to record-breaking ratings, finding it to be the bomb she planted on Jensen\\'s car. Coach detonates the bomb, killing Hennessey and Ulrich. Six months \"and 2000 miles later\", Joe and Jensen, reunited with Piper, are shown working in Mexico as mechanics, and are soon reunited with Case.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nIn March 2005, following the success of Alien vs. Predator (2004), director Paul W. S. Anderson revealed that he was directing a remake of Death Race 2000 (1975) entitled Death Race 3000 at Paramount Pictures based on a script by J. F. Lawton. The remake would be produced by the producer pair Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner. Anderson described the remake as a riff on the first film. \"It\\'s not a straight remake at all. The first movie was an across-America race. This will be an around-the-world race. And it\\'s set further in the future, so the cars are even more futuristic. So you\\'ve got cars with rockets, machine guns, force fields; cars that can split apart and re-form, a bit like Transformers. Cars that become invisible,\" the director explained. Comingsoon.net reported that \"Paul saw his film almost as a prequel if anything; almost the genesis of the Death Race\", though the film is referred to primarily as a remake in reviews and marketing materials.\\nTwo years later, Roger Corman, the producer of Death Race 2000, elaborated that he had an option agreement with producer Tom Cruise, and that Cruise would portray the lead role. The director said that Cruise had not been happy with the first two screenplays and that a third one was underway.  In June 2006, producer Jeremy Bolt reported that Anderson would direct the remake of Death Race 2000 after completing Resident Evil: Extinction (2007). The producer described the remake\\'s new tone: \"We\\'ve basically taken the idea of reality television and extended it twenty years. So it\\'s definitely a comment on society, and particularly reality television, but it is not as much a parody or a satire as the original. It\\'s more straight.\"  The following August, Paramount ended its relationship with Cruise/Wagner Productions, and Death Race was placed in turnaround. According to reports, when the project was discovered available, Universal Studios acquired it. Cruise and Wagner resumed their roles as producers, and Anderson returned to write and direct the film.In April 2007, actor Jason Statham entered negotiations to star in Death Race, with production slated to begin in late summer or early fall.  Anderson described that Death Race would take place in a prison, and that the film would be \"super-violent\" like its predecessor. \"It has little echoes of the original – a lot of people get run down, but rather than having the points system, which had no pay off anyway, it\\'s a pure race. It\\'s more like Gladiator, with the last person standing – or driving, winning,\" explained the director.  Filming on Death Race began in Montreal in August 2007.\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nThe film drew generally mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 42% rating based on reviews from 159 critics, with an average rating of 4.79/10. The website\\'s critical consensus states, \"Mindless, violent, and lightning-paced, Death Race is little more than an empty action romp.\" Metacritic reports a rating of 43 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore during opening weekend gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on a scale ranging from A+ to F.Robert Koehler of Variety called Death Race \"as hard as metal and just as dumb\" and criticized it for removing the humor of Death Race 2000. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film half a star (out of four), calling it \"an assault on all the senses, including common.\" Keith Phipps of the A. V. Club said the film is \"ideal for those who want to watch a bunch of cars blow each other up, without having to think about it all that much.\" Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle called Death Race \"one of the most boring drags of all time.\"Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle called the film \"an ill-advised and severely wussified remake.\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film one and a half stars (out of four), calling it \"junk\", and saying that \"the chases are pretty cool, but there\\'s absolutely nothing else to see.\" A positive review came from Nathan Lee of The New York Times, who said that \"the movie is legitimately greasy, authentically nasty, with a good old-fashioned sense of laying waste to everything in sight.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews awarded Death Race a score of two and a half stars (out of four), saying that it\\'s \"weak when it comes to things like plot, character, and acting, but it\\'s very good at provoking visceral reactions.\"\\n\\nBox office\\nThe film grossed $75,677,515, of which $36,316,032 was from North America.\\n\\nRelease\\nThe film was originally scheduled for release on September 26, 2008, but was moved to August 22, 2008.\\n\\nHome media\\nThe DVD and Blu-ray were released in the United States on December 21, 2008.

Haslinger recorded the string portion of his score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage.The soundtrack was released on August 19, 2008.\\n\\nPrequels and sequel\\nThe film is followed by two direct-to-video prequel films Death Race 2 (2010) and Death Race 3: Inferno (2013); both take place before this film and were filmed in South Africa. The films were directed by Roel Reiné, and star Luke Goss, Tanit Phoenix, Danny Trejo and Ving Rhames all appeared in the prequels. Lists and 14K are the only returning characters and are portrayed by Frederick Koehler and Robin Shou, respectively. A fourth film is a direct-to-video sequel to the first film, titled Death Race: Beyond Anarchy (2018), also featuring Lists, making him the only character to appear and be played by the same actor in all four films.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n Quotations related to Death Race (film) at Wikiquote\\n Media related to Death Race at Wikimedia Commons\\nOfficial website\\nDeath Race at IMDb\\nDeath Race at AllMovie',\n",

              " 'Ethan Hunt': 'Ethan Matthew Hunt is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Mission: Impossible film series. He is portrayed by Tom Cruise in all films to date.\\n\\nAppearances\\nMission: Impossible (1996)\\nIn the first film, Hunt acts as the IMF point man for an experienced field team led by veteran Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), his mentor. While attempting to recover stolen files containing information on all IMF\\'s field agents during a mission in Prague, the entire team, barring Hunt, is supposedly killed and the files are stolen, leaving Hunt the only suspect as he learns that the mission was a set-up to expose a mole who had been selling secrets to a Czech arms dealer (Vanessa Redgrave). Hunt decides to steal the genuine list himself, demanding that the genuine mole be present at the exchange. He sets up a rogue team of other disavowed agents, including computer expert Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno), and Jim\\'s wife Claire (Emmanuelle Béart), who had in fact survived the mission and chooses to help Ethan clear his name. Ethan later finds Jim alive and deduces that he is the real mole, working with Claire and Krieger; Jim chose to betray the IMF due to his disillusionment with the end of the Cold War. He, Claire, and Krieger intend to escape with the money for the list and frame Ethan for their crimes. Ethan works out their true agenda when Jim attempts to accuse IMF head Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) of being the mole, allowing Ethan to expose their survival to Kittridge. In a final confrontation in the Channel Tunnel, Claire is killed when she tries to protect Ethan in a moment of conscience, and Ethan avenges the rest of the team when he kills Jim and Krieger by destroying their escape helicopter with explosive chewing gum from the Prague mission. Ethan gets Luther reinstated as an IMF agent and considers leaving the IMF, but is offered a mission of his own during the flight home.\\n\\nMission: Impossible 2 (2000)\\nIn the second film, Hunt is tasked with retrieving a deadly genetically engineered virus, known as \"Chimera\", from a rogue IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who intends to release the virus after acquiring a controlling influence on the company that created it so that he can profit from sales of the cure.  Hunt attempts to infiltrate Ambrose\\'s inner circle through Ambrose\\'s former girlfriend, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), an accomplished thief. During their mission, Hunt and Nordoff-Hall engage in an affair that complicates the mission. At the climax, Nordoff-Hall is forced to infect herself with the last virus in order to save Hunt; with Hunt having destroyed the only other traces of the virus, she was thus able to shield Hunt until he could escape. Subsequently racing against time—the virus is incurable twenty hours after infection—Hunt manages to acquire the cure and is forced to kill Ambrose.\\n\\nMission: Impossible III (2006)\\nIn the third film, Hunt is now a semi-retired training officer for IMF and plans a quiet life with his fiancée Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), who does not know about the IMF. He is called back into service to rescue a former student called Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) captured during a mission in Germany, and recovers confidential information via stolen laptop. He is forced to once again go rogue in an attempt to track down the sadistic arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and secure a dangerous mystery item known as the \\'Rabbit\\'s Foot\\'. After an impromptu ceremony, Hunt and Julia are married, only for Owen, who has a double agent working within IMF, to kidnap Julia. With the help of his IMF team: Stickell, Declan Gormley (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), and Zhen Lei (Maggie Q), Hunt finds the Rabbit\\'s foot, saves his wife, and kills Owen Davian in Shanghai.\\nThe later film Mission: Impossible – Fallout confirms that Ethan and Julia were happy for a while, but their marriage was tainted every time they heard a disaster due to the possibility that Ethan could have done something to stop it.\\n\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)\\nIn the fourth film, Hunt—having just escaped from a deep-cover mission in prison—and his IMF team are blamed for an attack that destroys the Kremlin, resulting in the disavowal of the entire IMF. Despite lacking their usual resources, connections, technology, and backup, their mission is to find and stop Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), a former Soviet nuclear strategist who is intent on starting a nuclear war to usher in the next era of human evolution. As they chase Hendricks to Dubai and on to Mumbai, India, they themselves are pursued by a team of Russian agents trying to apprehend them. The team becomes increasingly fractured as individual members fight their own demons while trying to trust the others. Hunt manages to pull the team together, stop a nuclear bomb and clear the IMF of any involvement in the Kremlin attack. It is also revealed that Hunt had Julia\\'s death faked to protect her, something only he and the Secretary of IMF knew about, giving him the pretext to infiltrate the prison his team freed him from in the opening scenes.\\n\\nMission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015)\\nIn the fifth film, Hunt is assigned a mission that culminates in him hanging outside of an A400M military aircraft 5,000 feet above the ground in Belarus to recover a package that contains VX nerve gas. Although this mission succeeds, when he learns that the thieves responsible for stealing the gas lacked the connections to do so, Hunt begins to uncover evidence of the existence of the Syndicate, a consortium of covert operatives who wreak terrorist attacks worldwide. After Hunt is forced to go off-the-grid when he is nearly killed by a Syndicate operative and the IMF is disbanded and absorbed into the CIA due to its controversial and destructive methods, he spends six months trying to track the Syndicate. Eventually, he and his former team learn that the Syndicate was actually originally a British project to perform missions without oversight, but British agent Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) took the plans and went rogue, now seeking to steal files that would grant him access to various established bank accounts to finance future Syndicate operations. Refusing to allow the Syndicate to continue, Hunt and his team are able to capture Lane, with CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) subsequently forced to claim that the disbanding of IMF was a cover to allow them to track the Syndicate.\\n\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout (2018)\\nIn the sixth film, an IMF mission goes wrong when Ethan chooses to save Luther after his friend is taken hostage, allowing a splinter group of the Syndicate, known as the Apostles, to gain access to three plutonium cores that could be used to create nuclear weapons. Forced to work with CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), Ethan is able to assume the identity of Apostle contact John Lark (Liang Yang) and acquire one of the cores in exchange for breaking Solomon Lane out of prison – despite opposition from Ilsa Faust, now under orders to kill Lane or bring him back to Britain – but he, Luther and Benji later use Lane to trick Walker into revealing that he is Lark. When the Secretary is killed by Walker, Ethan\\'s team and Ilsa track Walker and Lane to a medical aid camp where Julia, Ethan\\'s estranged wife, is currently working, Ethan realizing that Lane and Walker intend to detonate the bombs there for both the personal reason of hurting Ethan and the wider-scale reason that such a nuclear detonation would contaminate the water supply for almost a third of the world\\'s population. While Luther, Julia, Benji and Ilsa disable the bombs and confront Lane, Ethan is forced to steal a helicopter that he doesn\\'t know how to fly to pursue Walker and acquire the bomb detonator, culminating in a desperate struggle on a steep cliff that ends with Walker forced off the cliff. With the crisis concluded, Ethan\\'s reputation and the reputation of the IMF is redeemed in the eyes of the CIA, who muse that Ethan\\'s focus on individual lives is important for his superiors as it allows them to focus on the biggest picture.\\n\\nVideo games\\nAside from the Mission: Impossible films, Ethan Hunt has appeared in the 1998 video game based on the first film and the 2003 video game Mission: Impossible – Operation Surma, voiced by Steve Blum. He also appears as a playable character in the crossover game Lego Dimensions, with archive recordings of Tom Cruise being used for his voice.\\n\\nReception\\nAs of March 2020, Hunt was voted #31 on Ranker\\'s \"The Most Hardcore Big Screen Action Heroes\".Vlad Dima, writing in Bright Lights Film Journal, said while the series succeeds due to \"inventive, over-the-top stunts, the relentless trickery, and ultimately... Tom Cruise\\'s star-power\", he said, \"One less obvious element, though, is a myth that slowly develops over the span of the series and comes to full bloom in Fallout... [is Ethan] Hunt\\'s eternal quest... to become the perfect man.\" Dima said Ethan Hunt \"comes from a long line of action heroes\" and that the character (and the films) have become more like James Bond and Jason Bourne. Hunt \"erases all of the weaknesses we have ever noticed in any of these screen heroes\". He is unlike Bourne in knowing his status as \"a good guy\" and unlike Bond in not womanizing, having cared about only two women. Dima said, \"This personal detail seems to be an important requirement in the mythology of the perfect man.\"\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",

It employs the same satirical style as Spitting Image, 2DTV and Bo\\' Selecta!, but using 3D animation created by UK Visual Effects and animation house Red Vision. Red Vision evolved a series of unique production techniques and a sophisticated animation pipeline to deliver the weekly topical elements of the series to hitherto impossible deadlines.\\nThe programme\\'s only series began on 6 April 2008, with weekly episodes until 11 May 2008, airing on Sundays at 10 pm.

The show included celebrities, politicians and members of the British Royal Family in their animated form, taking a role in sketches including scenarios from their own topical issues.The show\\'s name comes from the fact that all the subjects\\' caricatured faces are out of scale with the rest of their bodies.\\n\\nCharacters\\nLampooning people in the public eye, the impressionists got the chance to caricature politicians, royals and celebrities alike. These included Prime Minister Gordon Brown, portrayed as an out of touch, weak, very austere Scrooge like Victorian and has a dark, miserable old character. His Chancellor, Alistair Darling, is depicted as a panicky cry baby who says, \"We\\'re doomed, doomed, doomed\" while jumping around the room. There were also the forgetful Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, the vicious creature David Miliband and Tony Blair who, under the guise of Brown\\'s adviser Ed Balls, tricks Gordon for money.\\nOn the Conservatives\\' side, Leader of the Conservatives, David Cameron who was portrayed as insisting he\\'s an ordinary man of the people for a press conference, before reverting into a volatile, mean spirited, snobbish public schoolboy behind closed doors, He regularly beats his Shadow Chancellor and manservant George Osborne and forces him to do various unpleasant things, i.e. lick dog muck off his shoes (a reference to \"old Etonian\" fagging).\\nShadow Foreign Secretary William Hague is portrayed as an oafish, bitter alcoholic Yorkshireman (referencing his past claims of having drunk \"14 pints a day\" as a teenager) and the then newly elected Mayor of London Boris Johnson portrayed as half-man and half dog, so when he tries to talk about issues, he instead does acts of canine behaviour e.g. chasing his tail and licking his genitals.\\nWhile on the side of the Liberal Democrats, leader Nick Clegg is portrayed as a desperate leader ready to use anything (such as offers at Pizza Hut suggested by his party) as an excuse for the Lib Dems\\' \\'drive for change\\' influencing day to day Britain.\\nThe Royal Family are set up in the same style as they were on Spitting Image; the reasonably sane but a senile Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh \"and his dog (Poochwater)\" who do everything that they can to stop Prince William from marrying \"commoner\" Catherine Middleton (he calls her Kate Middle class) but never succeed, and Prince William and Prince Harry who try to act as \"normal blokes\", but ultimately fail – in one sketch they attempt to order pizza only to ask for caviar toppings.\\nThere were other international politicians that Headcases satirised like President George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, Condoleezza Rice, incompetent farmer Robert Mugabe, strong but dark character former President of Russia, Vladimir Putin and his successor portrayed as a ventriloquist\\'s dummy, Dmitry Medvedev, the sex mad medallion man, Nicolas Sarkozy as a flirty disco dancer who sings in French about international success and President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who is portrayed as a Borat like character who lists reasons why his country should have nuclear technology (including destroying the entire Middle East and most of Central Asia so Iran can move closer to Europe to compete in Euro 2012) calling his adversaries racists.\\nCelebrities impersonated include the populist and selfish former editor of the Daily Mirror newspaper Piers Morgan who gets a heavy object dropped on him each time; Victoria Beckham, a big headed loudmouth with a speech disorder and her dumb husband David, who is considerably shorter, going about their days working in America; Steven Spielberg; transsexual Madonna; Morgan Freeman; large breasted model Jordan and child minded Peter Andre; old and senile action stars Harrison Ford, Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis, styled as \"The (Geriatric) Action Heroes\", who fight their nemesis, money grabbing, snake haired old people hater Heather Mills; unintelligent Brad Pitt and his twisted wife Angelina Jolie, who keeps adopting children and imprisoning them to a factory making hair extensions to rival the golden locks of Jennifer Aniston, veteran newsreader Trevor McDonald; inappropriate uses for Russell Brand (e.g. as a toilet brush); Fabio Capello struggling to learn English leaving everyone confused at what he means when he speaks; far too similar footballers Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, whose attempts to work together for England are portrayed as Laurel and Hardy style slapstick comedy; angry, loud mouthed Jeremy Clarkson making ill-informed judgements; Richard Hammond who was left drowning when global warming hit the 2050 episode of Top Gear; sleepy, drunk and drug addled Pete Doherty and Amy Winehouse; complainers Bono and Bob Geldof; coin operated Jonathan Ross; bachelor George Clooney; Sebastian Coe presenting updates for the 2012 Olympics; Mohamed Al-Fayed and his conspiracy theories involving Fiat Unos; alien Tom Cruise and his robot wife Katie, and common chavs Helen Mirren and Judi Dench, who bully Kate Winslet because they are Dames and she is not.\\n\\nVoice artists\\nRory Bremner\\nJon Culshaw\\nLewis MacLeod\\nKayvan Novak\\nDaniel Maier\\nLucy Porter\\nJess Robinson\\nShelley Longworth\\nKaty Wix\\nKaty Brand\\nOmid Djalili\\nPhil Cornwell\\nLucy Montgomery\\nMark Perry\\nTom Hollander\\nAndrew Lawrence\\n\\nWriters\\nHenry Naylor\\nKevin Day\\nMark Evans\\nLucy Porter\\nCarl Carter\\nTony Cooke\\nSimon Dean\\nRichie Webb\\nMarc Blakewill & James Harris\\n\\nReception\\nSam Wollaston from The Guardian gave the show a mixed review, saying that the writing was good, but the animation was \"soulless\" and the Daily Star simply called it \"Hilarious\". The show\\'s debut opened with four million viewers, having the highest viewers of any programme for the first half of the show. However, the second half of the show was beaten by the news on BBC One. The second episode also attracted 4 million viewers.Peter Fluck was critical of the series. His initial assessment is decidedly lukewarm: the CGI puppets \"look pretty dead\", it might not be rude enough, and, if he were younger, he would bypass television and broadcast on YouTube instead. He is encouraged by the likes of Rory Bremner among the impersonators.\\n\\nDVD release\\nOn 15 June 2008, ITV announced that the only series would be available on DVD, which was released on 7 July.\\n\\nSee also\\nSpitting Image\\n2DTV\\nNewzoids\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nHeadcases at itv.com\\nHeadcases at IMDb\\nHeadcases at British Comedy Guide',\n",
              " 'Jack Reacher (film)': 'Jack Reacher is a 2012 American action thriller film written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, based on Lee Child\\'s 2005 novel One Shot. The film stars Tom Cruise as the title character, with Rosamund Pike, David Oyelowo, Richard Jenkins, Jai Courtney, Werner Herzog, and Robert Duvall also starring. The film entered production in October 2011, and was completed in January 2012. It was filmed entirely on location in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It received mixed reviews but was successful at the box office.\\nThe film was released in North America on December 21, 2012. The musical score was composed by Joe Kraemer, performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony and recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California. Cruise performed all of his own driving stunts during the film\\'s car chase sequence. Cruise reprised his role in the 2016 sequel, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, based on the 2013 novel Never Go Back.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a man drives a van into a parking garage across the Allegheny River from PNC Park, dropping a quarter into the meter. He readies a Springfield Armory M1A and assassinates five people on the river\\'s North Shore Trail from long range before driving off.\\nThe police, headed by Detective Calvin Emerson, find a shell casing as well as the quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint on the coin belongs to James Barr, a former U.S. Army sniper. When the police raid his house, they find the van, equipment for reloading rifle cartridges, the rifle in question, and Barr asleep in his bed.\\nDuring an interrogation by Emerson and District Attorney Alex Rodin, Barr is offered a choice between life in prison in exchange for a full confession or guaranteed death row, as Rodin has never lost a conviction. They are bewildered when Barr instead takes a notepad and writes \"Get Jack Reacher\". Reacher is a drifter and former Army Military Police officer. He arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news report about Barr and the shooting. Emerson and Rodin deny Reacher\\'s request to view the evidence but agree to let him see Barr, who was attacked by fellow inmates and is now in a coma. Reacher meets Barr\\'s defense attorney, Helen Rodin, the District Attorney\\'s daughter, who has been saddled with the apparently hopeless task of saving Barr from the death penalty.\\nHelen can let Reacher see the evidence if he will become her investigator. Reacher retorts that he is not interested in clearing Barr. He reveals that Barr had gone on a killing spree during his tour in Iraq but was not prosecuted because, unbeknownst to Barr, his victims were under investigation for numerous rapes and the U.S. Army wanted them forgotten. Reacher vowed that if Barr tried anything like this again, he would take him down.\\nReacher agrees to investigate if Helen visits the victims\\' families to learn about the people murdered that day. Reacher goes to the crime scene and finds inconsistencies about this location, thinking that a trained shooter would have done the killings from the cover of the van on the nearby Fort Duquesne Bridge. After Helen reports her findings about the victims to Reacher, he suggests that the owner of a local construction company was the intended victim, while the other victims served as a cover-up.\\nAfter an apparently spurious bar fight, Reacher realizes that someone is attempting to strong-arm him into dropping his investigation. Reacher is later framed for the murder of the young woman who was paid to instigate the bar-room brawl, but this only motivates him further. Reacher eventually follows up a lead at a shooting range in the neighboring state of Ohio, owned by former U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Martin Cash, who will talk only if Reacher will demonstrate his U.S. Army sniping skills.\\nThe real perpetrators are a gang masquerading as a legitimate construction firm, led by a former Soviet political prisoner known only as the Zec (prisoner). The gang kidnaps Helen with the aid of Detective Emerson and holds her hostage at a quarry. After he steals Helen\\'s Mercedes-Benz, Reacher outwits the mob guards, killing them (along with Emerson) with Cash\\'s help, before confronting the Zec about the conspiracy. The Zec points out that Reacher has killed most of the witnesses against him and doubts that he would be convicted, while also admitting that any prison sentence he is likely to serve would be relatively easy compared to his time in Siberia. Reacher shoots the Zec in the head on the spot.\\nReacher and Cash flee the scene with confidence that Helen will clear Reacher\\'s name. When Barr awakens from his coma, he tells Helen that he has no recent memory but believes that he must be guilty of the shootings. Barr\\'s mental reconstruction of how he would have committed the shootings confirms that Reacher\\'s theory was correct from the beginning. Still unaware of all these developments, Barr is willing to accept both responsibility and his punishment, fearing that Reacher will mete out justice if the law does not. However, it is clear he will be cleared of charges in this killing spree. Meanwhile, Reacher, sitting in a bus, turns around to a man verbally and physically abusing a woman sitting beside him.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nAttempts to adapt author Lee Child\\'s Jack Reacher novel series into a film have been made ever since the character debuted in 1997\\'s Killing Floor. After being optioned with no success to PolyGram and later New Line Cinema, Paramount Pictures and Cruise/Wagner Productions acquired the film rights in 2005. Screenwriter Josh Olson was then hired to adapt Child\\'s then-most recent novel in the Reacher series, One Shot (2005). In July 2010, Christopher McQuarrie, who previously collaborated with Cruise/Wagner Productions on the 2008 film Valkyrie, signed on to rework Olson\\'s script and ultimately direct the film.\\n\\nCasting\\nIn June 2011, Tom Cruise was in talks for playing the role of Jack Reacher. The following month, Cruise closed a deal with the studios and signed on for the part. Some fans of the novel series became vocal over the casting of Cruise due to the actor\\'s height not matching the description of Reacher in the novels. Explaining the casting decision, author Lee Child said that it would be impossible to find a suitable actor to play the giant Reacher and to recreate the feel of the book onscreen, and that Cruise had the talent to make an effective Reacher. Child also said, \"Reacher\\'s size in the books is a metaphor for an unstoppable force, which Cruise portrays in his own way.\" Of Cruise\\'s relatively small stature, Child said, \"With another actor you might get 100% of the height but only 90% of Reacher. With Tom, you\\'ll get 100% of Reacher with 90% of the height.\"Following the casting of Cruise, Rosamund Pike was cast as the female lead. Other actresses who were in the running for the role included Hayley Atwell and Alexa Davalos. By September 2011, the main cast was locked in with the hiring of David Oyelowo, Richard Jenkins, Jai Courtney, and Robert Duvall. Werner Herzog, primarily known for his directorial work, rounded out the cast in October 2011 when he signed on to play the film\\'s chief villain.In April 2017, Dwayne Johnson revealed that he was in the running to play Jack Reacher before Cruise was hired.In a 2018 interview, two years after the 2016 release of the sequel, Child agreed that the readers were correct in their criticism, stating:\\n\\nI really enjoyed working with Cruise. He\\'s a really, really nice guy. We had a lot of fun. But ultimately the readers are right. The size of Reacher is really, really important and it\\'s a big component of who he is...So what I\\'ve decided to do is – there won\\'t be any more movies with Tom Cruise. Instead we\\'re going to take it to Netflix or something like that. Long-form streaming television, with a completely new actor. We\\'re rebooting and starting over and we\\'re going to try and find the perfect guy.\\n\\nFilming\\nProduction on the film began in October 2011 and was completed in January 2012. Cruise performed all of his own driving stunts during the film\\'s signature car chase sequence. \"Action to me is something very fun to shoot. The challenge in most car chases is you\\'re trying to hide the fact that it\\'s not the actor driving,\" McQuarrie said. \"The challenge here was the exact opposite. We were trying to find a way to show that it was always Tom driving. He\\'s literally driving in every stunt sequence.\"In February 2012, Kevin Messick, one of the film\\'s executive producers, sued Don Granger and Gary Levinsohn, two other producers, for breach of contract over a joint venture agreement, claiming he had \"helped to develop the film, renew Paramount\\'s options for the rights to the book, and participated in the search for a screenwriter\" but starting in July 2010, had been left out of meetings with the screenwriter and the studio and not given certain drafts of the screenplay while it was under development. Messick is suing for \"unspecified damages, his producer\\'s fees and the right to participate in any upcoming sequels.\"\\n\\nMusic\\nThe film\\'s musical score was composed by Joe Kraemer, who previously scored director McQuarrie\\'s The Way of the Gun (2000). Kraemer was announced as the composer for the film in July 2012, having already started work on it. After spending eight weeks working with McQuarrie on materials to present to producers, Kraemer\\'s hiring was approved and he directly began working on the film\\'s opening eight minutes. \"I have a number of tricks that I use to spark the creative process,\" said Kraemer on his scoring process after having seen the film. \"Sometimes I\\'ll use my mathematical understanding of music to devise a theme (such as the open fifths of Reacher\\'s theme), sometimes I\\'ll have an orchestral color in mind (i.e. the music for THE ZEC). The actual composing process probably resembles Max Steiner more than anyone else I know of. I start at the first frame of the movie and work my through to the end, chronologically, in order.\"The film is noted for its balance between music and silence, with music primarily absent or reserved during a majority of the film\\'s action sequences. Discussing his approach to this balance, Kraemer described, \"Music can make such an impact when it enters a scene, and obviously the only way to do that is to have silence beforehand. I also generally like to have long tails on my cues so that they sort of fade away rather than ending abruptly. In this way, I try to weave music in and out very carefully so that the audience is as unaware as possible of the entrances and exits. I often cite Patton as a prime example of great spotting – a three and half hour biopic with, what, twenty-eight minutes of score? That\\'s unheard of today. But it worked!\"The score was performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony and recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California. A soundtrack album for the film was released on December 18, 2012 by La-La Land Records.\\nTrack listing\\n\\nDistribution\\nMarketing\\nThe trailer for Jack Reacher was officially released on Cruise\\'s birthday, July 3, 2012.\\n\\nTheatrical release\\nJack Reacher, then titled One Shot, was originally slated to be released in February 2013. In March 2012, the release date was brought forward by Paramount Pictures to December 21, 2012, hoping to capitalize on the box office success of Cruise\\'s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, which was released at a similar point in 2011. The film\\'s new release date pushed the release of World War Z back six months.The film was released in North American markets on December 21, 2012, with a premiere initially planned for Pittsburgh\\'s SouthSide Works megaplex on December 15, 2012, which was to be attended by the film\\'s stars, and Lee Child.On December 15, 2012, Paramount Pictures announced it was indefinitely postponing the film\\'s premiere screening in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, out of respect for the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which had occurred the day before. The opening scene shows a sniper shooting at people including a woman holding a small child, and one point aiming the cross-hairs directly at her. Writer-director McQuarrie endorsed the decision, saying he and Cruise insisted upon it:\\nNobody should be celebrating anything 24 hours after a tragic event like that. We thought long and hard about it. This was not a snap judgment, because we wanted to give back to the city of Pittsburgh [by having the premiere there], because they were so great to us.The film held its United Kingdom premiere on December 10, 2012 at London\\'s Odeon Leicester Square. It was released in the U.K. on December 26, 2012.\\n\\nHome media\\nJack Reacher was released onto Blu-ray and DVD formats in the United Kingdom on April 22 and in North American territories on May 7, 2013 by Paramount Home Media Distribution. The Blu-ray release contains two commentary tracks and three behind-the-scenes featurettes.  Jack Reacher received a 4K UHD Blu-Ray release on June 26, 2018.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nJack Reacher grossed $80.1 million in North America and $138.3 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $218.3 million, against a budget of $60 million.In North America, the film opened in 3,352 cinemas. Jack Reacher went on to gross $5.1 million on its opening day in the U.S. and Canada, and $15.6 million in its opening weekend. The film held well in its second weekend, dropping only 10.2% to a total of $14.1 million and ranking at No. 5.Upon its opening five-day international start, making $5.5 million in the UK and $4.4 million in France, the film grossed a total of $18.1 million from 32 international markets. Throughout the following weeks, the film expanded to additional international markets and grossed an international total of $136,497,530.\\n\\nCritical response\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 64%, based on 181 reviews, with a rating average of 6.27/10. The website\\'s critical consensus states, \"Jack Reacher is an above-average crime thriller with a smoothly charismatic performance from Tom Cruise.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted score of 50 out of 100, based on reviews from 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade filmgoers gave the film was an \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"Tom Cruise is in fine form as mysterious tough guy Jack Reacher finally reaches the big screen.\"\\nPeter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \"This is Cruise\\'s show. And he nails it. The patented smile is gone, replaced by a glower that makes Jack Reacher a dark and dazzling ride into a new kind of hell.\"Many of the negative reviews still referred to the film as entertaining, including The Guardian, which called it \"outrageous but entertaining\". \\nPeter Debruge of Variety was critical of the casting of Cruise as Reacher: \"Reacher is a brawny action figure whose exploits would have been a good fit for the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone back in the day, but feel less fun when delegated to a leading man like Tom Cruise. The star is too charismatic to play someone so cold-blooded, and his fans likely won\\'t appreciate the stretch. \"\\nLisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"That Cruise fails to make a case for Reacher\\'s allure, though, has less to do with physical dissonance than it does with the film\\'s inability - stupefying inability, really - to otherwise make a case for the character\\'s originality in a movie so choked with visual clichés and dreadfully moldy dialogue.\"\\n\\nSequel\\nWhile Jack Reacher was intended to be a tent-pole for a film series, it was initially reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to its lackluster run at the North American box office. However, in February 2013, the possibility of a sequel became more likely after the film surpassed a gross of $200 million worldwide. On December 9, 2013, it was announced that Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions were moving forward with the development of a sequel, reportedly based on the 2013 Jack Reacher novel Never Go Back.Principal photography on the sequel, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, began on October 20, 2015, in New Orleans. The sequel was directed by Edward Zwick, produced by Tom Cruise, Don Granger, and Christopher McQuarrie and was written by Zwick, Richard Wenk, and Marshall Herskovitz. It stars Tom Cruise, Cobie Smulders, Patrick Heusinger, Aldis Hodge, Danika Yarosh, and Holt McCallany. The plot follows Reacher going on-the-run with an army major who has been framed for espionage, and it reveals a dark conspiracy. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back was released on October 21, 2016, in IMAX and conventional formats. It grossed $161 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nJack Reacher at IMDb\\nJack Reacher at Box Office Mojo\\nJack Reacher at Rotten Tomatoes\\nJack Reacher at Metacritic\\n\\nJack Reacher at the Internet Movie Firearms Database',\n",

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while the first film received an \"A−\".Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine wrote: \"The star gives author Lee Childs’ action-lit ex-military hero an agility, rage and quick wit in this satisfying sequel\". Travers notes that Cruise is very different from the character in the books says critics need to get over it, and says \"Cruise finds the core of Reacher in his eyes, with a haunted gaze that says this lone wolf is still on a mission and still a long way from home. That\\'s the Reacher Lee Child created in his books. And Cruise does him proud.\"Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"a notable drop-off from the first Reacher feature\" and said \"by-the-numbers plotting, seen-it-all-before action moves, banal locations and a largely anonymous cast alongside the star give this a low-rent feel.\"\\nPeter Debruge of Variety magazine wrote: \"Zwick barely manages to tickle our adrenaline, waiting till the climactic showdown amid a New Orleans Halloween parade to deliver a sequence that could legitimately register as memorable.\"\\n\\nCancelled sequel and TV series\\nFollowing the mixed critical reception to Never Go Back, plans for a third installment were delayed, while a reboot in the form of an Amazon Prime exclusive television series was announced. In July of 2020, Christopher McQuarrie stated that he and Cruise had been working on developments for additional movies featuring the titular character. Plans for the third film included darker themes, with intentions for the future movies in the series to be R-rated. The filmmaker further acknowledged the possibility for a return to the series at a later date, stating though the \"franchise has moved on...we haven’t.\"\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nJack Reacher: Never Go Back at IMDb',\n",

              " 'Mission: Impossible (film)': 'Mission: Impossible is a 1996 American action spy film directed by Brian De Palma and produced by and starring Tom Cruise. A continuation of both the original television series of the same name and its revived sequel series (and set six years after the events of the latter show), it is the first installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. The plot follows Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his mission to uncover the mole who has framed him for the murders of most of his Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team.\\nWork on the script had begun early with filmmaker Sydney Pollack on board, before De Palma, Steven Zaillian, David Koepp, and Robert Towne were brought in. Mission: Impossible went into pre-production without a shooting script: De Palma devised several action sequences, but Koepp and Towne were dissatisfied with the story that led up to those events. U2 band members Larry Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton produced a dance rendition of the original theme music, which became a top-ten hit in the US (receiving gold record certification) and six other countries and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.\\nMission: Impossible was a commercial success, eventually becoming the third highest-grossing film of 1996 along with a mostly positive response from critics. Its success spawned the Mission: Impossible film series.\\n\\nPlot\\nJim Phelps and his latest Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team, who had just finished a mission in Kyiv, are dispatched to stop the theft of the CIA non-official cover (NOC) list from the American embassy in Prague by rogue agent Alexander Golitsyn. However, the mission unexpectedly fails: the list is stolen, Phelps is seemingly shot, his wife Claire and another agent die in a car bombing, and the rest of the team, including Golitsyn, are eliminated by unknown assassins and supposed tech malfunctions, with Ethan Hunt being the sole survivor. Meeting with IMF director Eugene Kittridge, Hunt reveals his awareness of a second IMF team sent to monitor them, and learns the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy, and the mission was a setup to lure out a mole within the IMF, who is believed to be working with an arms dealer known as \"Max\" as part of \"Job 314.\" As Hunt is the only surviving member, Kittridge suspects him of being the mole, and Hunt flees, covering his escape by using explosive chewing gum that fellow agent Jack Harmon gave him prior to the mission.\\nReturning to the Prague safe house, Hunt realizes \"Job 314\" refers to Bible verse Job 3:14, \"Job\" being the mole\\'s code name. Claire arrives at the safe house, explaining that she escaped the car bombing after Phelps aborted the mission. Hunt arranges a meeting with Max, and warns her that she has been given a fake list on a disc equipped with a tracking device. Max and her agents escape, taking Hunt with them, just before a CIA team raids their location; Hunt promises to deliver the real list in return for $10 million and Job\\'s identity. Claire chooses to join Ethan, despite his initial protests against it, stating that since she is alive, the IMF will consider her a co-conspirator to Ethan whether she goes with him or not.\\nHunt and Claire recruit two disavowed IMF agents: computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Franz Krieger. They infiltrate CIA headquarters in Langley, steal the real list while narrowly avoiding detection, and flee to London. Kittridge, detecting the theft, has Hunt\\'s mother and uncle falsely arrested for drug trafficking. He provides media coverage of the arrest, forcing Hunt to contact him from Liverpool Street Station. Hunt allows the CIA to trace him to London before hanging up, but is surprised to find Phelps nearby. Phelps recounts surviving the shooting, naming Kittridge as the mole. Hunt, however, realizes Phelps is the mole, having discovered the Bible he has been using to communicate with Max having a Gideons stamp that Phelps stole from Chicago\\'s Drake Hotel during a previous assignment known to Hunt\\'s team. Hunt, pretending to believe Phelps\\' words, pieces together how Phelps betrayed the team: he programmed the elevator to kill Jack, faked being shot, and had the car rigged to explode. Hunt also suspects Krieger in the deaths of the other IMF members, including Golitsyn, in Prague, having recognized his distinctive knife; however, he is unsure whether Claire was involved, since she recommended Krieger. Hunt arranges with Max to exchange the list aboard the TGV train to Paris the next day and secretly sends tickets to Kittridge.\\nOn the train, Hunt remotely directs Max to the list. Max verifies it and directs Hunt to the baggage car, where he can find both the money and Job. Hunt calls Claire and tells her to meet him there. Meanwhile, Stickell uses a jamming device to prevent Max from uploading the data to her servers. Claire reaches the baggage car, finds Phelps and tells him Hunt will arrive shortly. She questions the idea of killing Hunt, since they will need a fall guy, but Phelps reveals himself to be Hunt in a mask, exposing her as a co-conspirator. When the real Phelps arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Hunt dons a pair of video glasses that relays Phelps\\' image to Kittridge, blowing Phelps\\' cover as the mole.\\nPhelps threatens to kill Hunt, but kills Claire instead when she tries to talk him out of it. He climbs to the roof of the train, where Krieger is waiting with a helicopter and a tether. Angry over Claire\\'s murder, Hunt chases after him. As Jim attempts to escape, Hunt launches himself towards Jim. Hunt connects the tether to the train itself, forcing the helicopter into the Channel Tunnel after the train. Hunt attaches explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps, while himself jumping to safety. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents. Hunt is unsure about returning to the team, but on the flight home, an attendant, through a coded phrase, asks him if he wants to take on a new mission.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment and writing\\nParamount Pictures owned the rights to the television series and had tried for years to make a film version but had failed to come up with a viable treatment. Tom Cruise had been a fan of the show since he was young and thought that it would be a good idea for a film. The actor chose Mission: Impossible to be the inaugural project of his new production company and convinced Paramount to put up a $70 million budget. Cruise and his producing partner, Paula Wagner, worked on a story with filmmaker Sydney Pollack for a few months when the actor hired Brian De Palma to direct. They went through two screenplay drafts that no one liked. De Palma brought in screenwriters Steve Zaillian, David Koepp, and finally Robert Towne. When the film was green-lit Koepp was initially fired with Robert Towne being the lead writer and Koepp being brought back on later. According to the director, the goal of the script was to \"constantly surprise the audience.\" Reportedly, Koepp was paid $1 million to rewrite an original script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz. According to one project source, there were problems with dialogue and story development. However, the basic plot remained intact.The film went into pre-production without a script that the filmmakers wanted to use. De Palma designed the action sequences but neither Koepp nor Towne were satisfied with the story that would make these sequences take place. Towne ended up helping organize a beginning, middle and end to hang story details on while De Palma and Koepp worked on the plot. De Palma convinced Cruise to set the first act of the film in Prague, a city rarely seen in Hollywood films at the time. Reportedly, studio executives wanted to keep the film\\'s budget in the $40–50 million range, but Cruise wanted a \"big, showy action piece\" that took the budget up to the $62 million range. The scene that takes place in a glass-walled restaurant with a big lobster tank in the middle and three huge fish tanks overhead was Cruise\\'s idea. There were 16 tons in all of the tanks and there was a concern that when they detonated, a lot of glass would fly around. De Palma tried the sequence with a stuntman, but it did not look convincing and he asked Cruise to do it, despite the possibility that the actor could have drowned.The script that Cruise approved called for a final showdown to take place on top of a moving train. The actor wanted to use the famously fast French train the TGV but rail authorities did not want any part of the stunt performed on their trains. When that was no longer a problem, the track was not available. De Palma visited railroads on two continents trying to get permission. Cruise took the train owners out to dinner and the next day they were allowed to use it. For the actual sequence, the actor wanted wind that was so powerful that it could knock him off the train. Cruise had difficulty finding the right machine that would create the wind velocity that would look visually accurate before remembering a simulator he used while training as a skydiver. The only machine of its kind in Europe was located and acquired. Cruise had it produce winds up to 140 miles per hour so it would distort his face. Exterior shots of the train were filmed on the Glasgow South Western Line, between New Cumnock, Dumfries and Annan. Most of the sequence, however, was filmed on a stage against a blue screen for later digitizing by the visual effects team at Industrial Light & Magic.The filmmakers delivered the film on time and under budget, a rarity in Hollywood, with Cruise doing most of his own stunts. Initially, there was a sophisticated opening sequence that introduced a love triangle between Jim Phelps, his wife Claire and Ethan Hunt that was removed because it took the test audience \"out of the genre\", according to De Palma. There were rumors that  Cruise and De Palma did not get along, and these rumors were fueled when the director excused himself at the last moment from scheduled media interviews before the film\\'s theatrical release.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe film uses Lalo Schifrin\\'s original \"Theme from Mission: Impossible\". Alan Silvestri was originally hired to write the film\\'s score, but his music was rejected and replaced with a new score by composer Danny Elfman. According to some sources, Silvestri had written and recorded some 20 minutes of music, and the decision to replace him was made by producer Tom Cruise during post-production. Elfman had only a few weeks to compose and produce the final score, which used Schifrin\\'s \"The Plot\" theme in addition to his main theme, as well as new themes composed by Elfman for the characters Ethan Hunt, Claire and the IMF.U2 bandmates Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton were fans of the TV show and knew the original theme music well, but were nervous about remaking Schifrin\\'s legendary theme song. Clayton put together his own version in New York City and Mullen did his in Dublin on weekends between U2 recording sessions. The two musicians were influenced by Brian Eno and the European dance club scene sound of the recently finished album Passengers. They allowed Polygram to pick its favorite and they wanted both. In a month, they had two versions of the song and five remixed by DJs. All seven tracks appeared on a limited edition vinyl release.The song entered the top 10 of music charts around the world, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1997, and was a critical and commercial success.\\n\\nMarketing\\nApple Computer had a $15 million promotion linked to the film that included a game, print ads and television spot featuring scenes from the TV show turned into the feature film; dealer and in-theater promos; and a placement of Apple personal computers in the film. This was an attempt on Apple\\'s part to improve their image after posting a $740 million loss in its fiscal second quarter.\\n\\nReception\\nOriginal television series cast\\nSeveral cast members of the original television series that ran from 1966–73, reacted negatively to the film.\\nActor Greg Morris, who portrayed Barney Collier in the original television series, was reportedly disgusted with the film\\'s treatment of the Phelps character, and he walked out of the theater before the film ended. Peter Graves, who played Jim Phelps in the original series as well as in the late-1980s revival, also disliked how Phelps turned out in the film. Graves had been offered the chance to reprise his role from the TV series, but turned it down upon learning his character would be revealed to be a traitor.Martin Landau, who portrayed Rollin Hand in the original series, expressed his own disapproval concerning the film. In an MTV interview in October 2009, Landau stated, \"When they were working on an early incarnation of the first one — not the script they ultimately did — they wanted the entire team to be destroyed, done away with one at a time, and I was against that. It was basically an action-adventure movie and not Mission. Mission was a mind game. The ideal mission was getting in and getting out without anyone ever knowing we were there. So the whole texture changed. Why volunteer to essentially have our characters commit suicide? I passed on it ... The script wasn\\'t that good either!\"\\n\\nBox office\\nMission: Impossible opened on May 22, 1996 in a then-record 3,012 theaters, becoming the first film to be released to over 3,000 theaters in the United States, and broke the record for a film opening on Wednesday with US$11.8 million, beating the $11.7 million Terminator 2: Judgment Day made in 1991. The film also set house records in several theaters around the United States. Mission: Impossible grossed $75 million in its first six days, surpassing Jurassic Park, and took in more than $56 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, beating out The Flintstones. Cruise deferred his usual $20 million fee for a significant percentage of the box office. The film went on to make $180.9 million in North America and $276.7 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $457.6 million.\\n\\nCritical response\\nMission: Impossible received mainly positive reviews from critics. The film has a 64% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10, with the critical consensus reading, \"Full of special effects, Brian De Palma’s update of Mission: Impossible has a lot of sweeping spectacle, but the plot is sometimes convoluted\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"This is a movie that exists in the instant, and we must exist in the instant to enjoy it.\" In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden addressed the film\\'s convoluted plot: \"If that story doesn\\'t make a shred of sense on any number of levels, so what? Neither did the television series, in which basic credibility didn\\'t matter so long as its sci-fi popular mechanics kept up the suspense.\" Mike Clark of USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and said that it was \"stylish, brisk but lacking in human dimension despite an attractive cast, the glass is either half-empty or half-full here, though the concoction goes down with ease.\"However, Hal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, \"There are empty thrills, and some suspense. But throughout the film, we keep waiting for some trace of personality, some color in the dialogue, some hipness in the staging or in the characters\\' attitudes. And it\\'s not there.\" Time magazine\\'s Richard Schickel wrote, \"What is not present in Mission: Impossible (which, aside from the title, sound-track quotations from the theme song and self-destructing assignment tapes, has little to do with the old TV show) is a plot that logically links all these events or characters with any discernible motives beyond surviving the crisis of the moment.\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a \"B\" rating and said, \"The problem isn\\'t that the plot is too complicated; it\\'s that each detail is given the exact same nagging emphasis. Intriguing yet mechanistic, jammed with action yet as talky and dense as a physics seminar, the studiously labyrinthine Mission: Impossible grabs your attention without quite tickling your imagination.\"Many critics have given the CIA break-in, and the final climactic chase sequence, particular praise often in spite of their reception of the rest of the film. Both scenes have frequently featured highly on fans and critics lists of best action scenes from this series, and have been referenced many times in other subsequent works.\\n\\nAccolades\\nHome media\\nMission: Impossible was released by Paramount Home Video on VHS on November 12, 1996 and DVD on January 17, 1998. The film was released on DVD again on April 11, 2006, as a special collector\\'s edition.

He shows McCloy a memory card video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich\\'s colleagues before blackmailing McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals the camera\\'s memory card and delivers it to Ethan. They learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim\\'s red blood cells. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. When Nyah discreetly returns the memory card to Ambrose, he notices it is in the wrong pocket of his jacket.\\nEthan\\'s team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, the only Bellerophon samples were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose\\'s hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus; unbeknownst to him at the time, Nekhorvich injected himself with Chimera to smuggle it out of Biocyte. Ambrose plans to exchange a sample of Bellerophon to McCloy for a sample of Chimera. Ethan\\'s team breaks into Biocyte to destroy the virus before the exchange can take place. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing the plan, then captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of Chimera before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues, culminating in the sample being dropped on the floor between Ambrose and Ethan. Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the sample; she instead injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from simply killing her after she retrieved it for him. Nyah insists that Ethan kill her to destroy the virus but Ethan is unwilling to do so. Ambrose takes Nyah away as Ethan escapes from the laboratory.\\nAmbrose releases Nyah to wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a pandemic. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options, to make him Biocyte\\'s majority shareholder. He predicts that the price of Biocyte\\'s stock will skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon after the Chimera outbreak. Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose\\'s men, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent the eventual outbreak. Ethan kills Ambrose\\'s men but Ambrose chases him to a beach where Ethan defeats him in a brutal fistfight. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan at the beach. As Ethan is about to give Luther the Bellerophon canister, Ambrose recovers and points a gun at Ethan. Ethan throws the canister to Luther and jumps away from Ambrose\\'s shot while kicking up a gun from the sand which he uses to finally kill Ambrose. Luther injects Nyah with the Bellerophon in time to cure her.\\nIMF clears Nyah\\'s criminal record and Ethan starts his vacation with her in Sydney.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nAccording to screenwriter Robert Towne several action sequences were already planned for the film prior to his involvement and before the story had been written.The studio expressed concern over the safety of shooting Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)\\'s entrance in the film, where he is free solo climbing in Moab, Utah\\'s Dead Horse Point State Park. Cruise refused to drop the idea because he could not think of a better way to reintroduce the character. There was no safety net as he filmed the sequence, but he did have a harness. He tore his shoulder when performing the jump from one part of the cliff to another. Most of the scenes were also shot in Sydney, Australia.\\nIn a 2020 interview, Thandie Newton spoke about her tense on-set experiences with Cruise when filming the movie.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe film\\'s original score was composed and conducted by Hans Zimmer and features vocals performed by Lisa Gerrard. In addition, the film includes contemporary music such as Limp Bizkit\\'s rendition of Lalo Schifrin\\'s Mission: Impossible theme entitled \"Take a Look Around\" as well as Metallica\\'s \"I Disappear\".While Ethan is rock climbing during his holiday, Zap Mama\\'s remixed version of \"Iko Iko\" plays on the soundtrack.\\n\\nRelease\\nIn its North American opening weekend, the film grossed $57,845,297, ranking at #1. It held on to the No. 1 spot for three weekends. The film eventually grossed $215,409,889 in its North American release and $330,978,216 in other territories, totaling $546,388,105 worldwide, the highest-grossing film of 2000. It is John Woo\\'s highest grossing film of all time, surpassing Face/Off, and was the highest-grossing film in the Mission: Impossible series at the time of release, holding the record for eleven years before being surpassed by Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.\\nMission: Impossible 2 was released on VHS and DVD on November 7, 2000, with a rare Japanese LaserDisc release following on April 3, 2001 (released extremely late in the format\\'s life), with a potential North American release of this LaserDisc being cancelled in mid-2001. A Blu-ray release followed on June 3, 2008, and an Ultra HD Blu-ray version was released on June 26, 2018.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes indicates the film has an overall approval rating of 57% based on 143 reviews and an average score of 5.9/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Your cranium may crave more substance, but your eyes will feast on the amazing action sequences\". Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 40 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, down from the first film\\'s \"B+\".Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said that \"if the first movie was entertaining as sound, fury, and movement, this one is more evolved, more confident, more sure-footed in the way it marries minimal character development to seamless action.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly felt the film was a \"throwaway pleasure\" but also \"a triumph of souped-up action.\" Ella Taylor of LA Weekly said that \"every car chase, every plane crash, every potential drop off a cliff is a masterpiece of grace and surprise.\" Desson Howe of The Washington Post said that \"[John] Woo [...] takes complete command of the latest technology to create brilliant action sequences.\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, \"Check your brains at the popcorn stand and hang on for a spectacular ride.\"J. Hoberman of The Village Voice called the film \"a vaguely absurd thriller filled with elaborately superfluous setups and shamelessly stale James Bond riffs.\" Dennis Harvey of Variety said the film is \"even more empty a luxury vehicle than its predecessor\" and that it \"pushes the envelope in terms of just how much flashy packaging an audience will buy when there\\'s absolutely nada inside.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader said that \"no hero or villain winds up carrying any moral weight at all.\"In a retrospective commentary in 2012, Brad Brevet noted the film has significant similarities in plot and themes to Alfred Hitchcock\\'s 1946 film Notorious.Mission: Impossible 2 was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards at the 2000 ceremony, including Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Supporting Actress for Thandie Newton. It was also nominated for a Stinker Award at the 2000 ceremony for Worst Song (Limp Bizkit\\'s \"Take a Look Around\").A comedy short titled Mission: Improbable was shown during the 2000 MTV Movie Awards.

The cast includes Cruise, Ving Rhames, Henry Czerny, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Angela Bassett and Frederick Schmidt, all of whom reprise their roles from the previous films, along with Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham, and Esai Morales, who will join the franchise.\\nMission: Impossible 7 is scheduled to be released theatrically on November 19, 2021, by Paramount Pictures, followed by a streaming release on Paramount+ 45 days later. A direct sequel, also directed by McQuarrie, will be released on November 4, 2022.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent and leader of a team of operatives.\\nVing Rhames as Luther Stickell, an IMF agent, a member of Hunt\\'s team and his closest friend.\\nSimon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent and a member of Hunt\\'s team.\\nRebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, a former MI6 agent who allied with Hunt\\'s team during Rogue Nation and Fallout.\\nVanessa Kirby as Alanna Mitsopolis, a black market arms dealer also known as the White Widow.

McQuarrie described Atwell\\'s character as a \"destructive force of nature\", while Atwell explained that her character\\'s loyalties are \"somewhat ambiguous\" and said, \"I\\'ve been living in an existential crisis since October, going \\'who am I? who am I?\\' An actor in search of a character... There\\'s ambiguity…the interesting thing we\\'re exploring is her resistance to a situation she finds herself in. How she starts off, where she becomes. The journey of what she comes into and what is asked of her and potentially where she ends up.\"\\n\\nProduction\\nAnnouncement and casting\\nOn January 14, 2019, Cruise initially announced that the seventh and eighth Mission: Impossible films would be shot back-to-back with McQuarrie writing and directing both films for July 23, 2021, and August 5, 2022 releases. However, in February 2021, Deadline Hollywood revealed that Paramount had decided to no longer move forward with that plan.In February 2019, Ferguson confirmed her return for the seventh installment. In September 2019, McQuarrie announced on his Instagram profile that Hayley Atwell had joined the cast. In September 2019, Pom Klementieff joined the cast for both the seventh and eighth films. In December 2019, Simon Pegg confirmed his return for the film, with Shea Whigham cast for both films. Nicholas Hoult was cast in a role in January 2020, along with the addition of Henry Czerny, reprising his role as Eugene Kittridge for the first time since the 1996 film. Vanessa Kirby also announced she was returning for both films. In May 2020, it was reported that Esai Morales would replace Hoult as the villain in both films due to scheduling conflicts.\\n\\nFilming and COVID-19 shutdown\\nUnder the working title Libra, filming was scheduled to begin on February 20, 2020, in Venice, set up to last for three weeks before moving to Rome in mid-March for 40 days, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, production in the country was halted. Three weeks later, stunt rehearsals began in Surrey, England, just before a hiatus. On July 6, 2020, after another hiatus, crew arriving in the UK were given permission to begin filming without going through the mandatory 14-day quarantine. The set is located at Warner Bros Studios, Leavesden in Hertfordshire.The following month, similar permission was granted for filming in Møre og Romsdal, Norway. That same month, a large fire broke out on a motorcycle stunt rig in Oxfordshire. The scene had taken six weeks to prepare and was \"among one of the most expensive ever filmed in the U.K.\" No one was hurt in the incident.Filming began on September 6, 2020, when McQuarrie started to publish pictures from the sets on his Instagram profile. In October 2020, across Norway, when the previous installment was filmed in Preikestolen, including the municipalities of Stranda and Rauma, with Cruise sighted filming an action scene with Esai Morales atop a train. On October 26, 2020, production was halted in Italy after 12 people tested positive for COVID-19 on set. Filming resumed a week later.In December 2020, during filming in London, an audio recording of Cruise shouting at two production crew members for breaking COVID-19 protocols on set was released online. Cruise was likened to his character Les Grossman from the 2008 film Tropic Thunder as a result. The response from the general public, and that of many celebrities, was supportive; suggesting that his tone, and seriousness were warranted given the extreme circumstances and burden of ensuring production not be halted again. Others took it more negatively, with Leah Remini calling him an “abusive dictator”, blaming Scientology, and suggesting that the rant felt staged.On December 28, 2020, Variety reported that the film would conclude principal photography at Longcross Film Studios in the United Kingdom with production shifting from Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden. Longcross, which is in Surrey in Southeast England, falls within Tier 4, although productions are allowed to continue under strict COVID-19 protocols. In February 2021, filming concluded in the Middle East and the crew would return to London for some \"finishing touches\". It was also announced it was no longer filming directly back-to-back with the eighth film.\\n\\nPolish railway bridge controversy\\nIn late 2019, during the pre-production of the film, a rough concept of a sequence set in Alps in Switzerland included a train going 60 miles an hour through a bridge being blown up, as a reference to the climactic train wreck scene in the 1926 silent film The General. The Swiss government refused to authorize any explosions, therefore the Skydance Media production team embarked on location scouts in different countries to find an unwanted railway bridge. Among those asked to help with staging a \"full-scale train crash\" was Polish-American film producer Andrew Eksner. In November 2019, the Polish State Railways proposed Eksner to use a 151-meter long, 1908 post-German riveted truss bridge on Lake Pilchowickie [pʲilxɔvʲit͡skʲɛ] [pl; es], in the Jelenia Góra Valley, in Lower Silesia. In December 2019, Paramount Pictures producers including McQuarrie landed in southern Poland, accompanied in deep secrecy by officers of the Polish engineering troops. McQuarrie documented the visit on his Instagram profile. For carrying out the Libra project on site, the selected Polish production company Alex Stern was granted a PLN 5.5 million ($1.5 million) cash rebate from the Polish Film Institute.Officially opened in 1912 by Wilhelm II himself, the proposed bridge survived World War II mostly intact, and was used by trains until 2016, when the line was temporarily closed due to the bad condition of the tracks. Despite publicly praising the bridge \"extremely valuable,\" an expert misrepresented conclusions of a commissioned report, that instead of renovating, it would be best to demolish the bridge before building a new one. In March 2020, after rejected Eksner spread the information, local authorities and museum officials were appalled by the producers\\' intention to physically destroy the bridge, instead of using CGI effects. The filmmakers and authorities said the bridge was devastated and intended for demolition anyway.By July 2020, history and railways enthusiasts protested, as did some scientists, filmmakers, and the regional Monuments Heritage Office, along with members of Polish parliament, and The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage. Activists and NGOs launched a petition against the destruction. And as it was long registered provincially, and now being added into Poland\\'s national Registry of Objects of Cultural Heritage, the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage confirmed it was pushing the bridge to play in the movie, with a \"small section\" to be demolished onset in April 2021, before revitalizing the related local heritage railway line altogether. Following the backlash, the General Conservator of Monuments assured there was no question of destroying the bridge.In August 2020, as the story turned international, McQuarrie said there was never a plan to blow up the bridge, and that only unsafe and partially damaged portions could have been destroyed, which needed to be rebuilt, concluding: \"To open up the area to tourism, the bridge needed to go.\" He later added that “there was no disrespect intended.” The production company did not pledge to cover construction costs of a potential new bridge, nor the renovation of the historic one. On August 18, 2020, cultural heritage registration procedures for the Lake Pilchowickie bridge were finalized, effectively preventing it from any damage. Although the Polish State Railways have offered an alternative bridge to be blown up – a disused 1910, 245-meter-long railway bridge over Warta, in west-central Poland – the provincial Conservator initiated its immediate addition into the national Registry. In August 2020, the scouting for another bridge was ongoing.\\n\\nMusic\\nIn early May 2020, the composer Lorne Balfe was confirmed to be returning to compose a score for the seventh and eighth Mission: Impossible films, after scoring the sixth one.\\n\\nRelease\\nMission: Impossible 7 is scheduled to be released on November 19, 2021. It was originally set for release on July 23, 2021, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film will then be available to stream on Paramount+ 45 days after its theatrical debut.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nMission: Impossible 7 at IMDb',\n",
              " 'Mission: Impossible III': 'Mission: Impossible III (stylized as M:i:III) is a 2006 American action spy film co-written and directed by J. J. Abrams (in his directorial debut), co-written by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and co-produced by and starring Tom Cruise in the role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt. It is the third installment in the Mission: Impossible film series, following 2000\\'s Mission: Impossible 2. In the film, Ethan (Cruise) has retired from field work for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) and trains new recruits. However, he is sent back into action to track down the elusive arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman).\\nMission: Impossible III premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 26, 2006, and was released in the United States on May 5, 2006. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who considered it an improvement over its predecessors, and was a commercial success, grossing over $397 million against a $150 million budget. It was followed by Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol in 2011.\\n\\nPlot\\nEthan Hunt has retired from field work for the IMF. He instead trains new recruits while settling down with his fiancée, Julia Meade, a nurse who is unaware of Ethan\\'s true job. He is approached by IMF Assistant Director of Operations John Musgrave about a mission to rescue one of Ethan\\'s protégés, Lindsey Farris. Lindsey was captured while investigating arms dealer Owen Davian. Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner Luther Stickell.\\nThe team rescues Lindsey in Berlin and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey\\'s head. Before he can disable it, it kills her. IMF Director Theodore Brassel reprimands Ethan and Musgrave. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic microdot under the stamp.\\nIMF technician Benji Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in Vatican City to obtain a mysterious object codenamed the \"Rabbit\\'s Foot\". Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospital\\'s chapel. The team infiltrates Vatican City and captures Davian.\\nOn the return flight, Ethan threatens to drop Davian from the plane as he interrogates him about the Rabbit\\'s Foot, but Davian refuses to reveal anything. After landing, Ethan learns that the microdot contains a video of Lindsey warning that Brassel is seemingly working with Davian. The convoy taking Davian across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel is ambushed by mercenaries, who extract Davian. Realizing Julia is also in danger, Ethan races to Julia\\'s workplace, only to discover she has already been kidnapped. Davian calls Ethan and gives him 48 hours to recover the Rabbit\\'s Foot in exchange for Julia\\'s life. Before Ethan can, he is captured by the IMF.\\nMusgrave takes part in Ethan\\'s interrogation. He discreetly mouths that the Rabbit\\'s Foot is located in Shanghai and assists Ethan in escaping. Ethan is declared an enemy of the state and placed on Interpol\\'s most wanted list.\\nEthan secretly travels to Shanghai, where Declan, Zhen, and Luther, sent by Musgrave under the guise of another operation, assist him in acquiring the Rabbit\\'s Foot. As he delivers the Rabbit\\'s Foot to the meeting point, Ethan is tranquilized. When he comes to, a micro-explosive is implanted in his head. Restrained, Ethan sees Davian holding Julia at gunpoint, gagged to a chair. Despite Ethan asserting that he brought the real Rabbit\\'s Foot, Davian shoots Julia and leaves. Musgrave arrives and reveals himself as the IMF traitor; he explains that Julia is still alive, and the woman killed was Davian\\'s head of security disguised as Julia, executed for failing to protect him in Vatican City. The ruse was to confirm the authenticity of the Rabbit\\'s Foot. He arranged for Davian to acquire the Rabbit\\'s Foot and sell it to a terrorist group so that IMF would have reason to launch a preemptive strike, to increase the American military presence in the Middle East.\\nWhen Musgrave lets his guard down, Ethan knocks him unconscious. He frees himself and uses Musgrave\\'s phone to track the last call\\'s location to find Julia. With help from Benji on the phone, he locates the place but encounters Davian and some of his henchmen. Ethan kills the henchmen, but Davian arms the explosive in Ethan\\'s head. Ethan fights and kills Davian. He comes back to free Julia and jury-rigs an impromptu defibrillator to deactivate the explosive. Julia fights off and kills a henchman, then Musgrave, who is carrying the Rabbit\\'s Foot. She resuscitates Ethan, who explains his true IMF career to her.  Back in the US, Brassel and others congratulate Ethan as he leaves for his honeymoon with Julia.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nIn 2002, director David Fincher was slated to direct the next installment of the Mission: Impossible film series for a summer of 2004 release date. Fincher, however, dropped out in favor of another film, later citing creative differences over the direction of the series. Replacing Fincher was director Joe Carnahan, who worked on developing the film for 15 months. Under his involvement, the film was to feature \"Kenneth Branagh playing a guy who\\'s based on Timothy McVeigh,\" as well as Carrie-Anne Moss and Scarlett Johansson in other roles. Thandie Newton was offered to reprise her role as Nyah Nordoff-Hall from Mission: Impossible 2 but she declined, in order to concentrate on her family. Her role in the story was later changed to a new character named Leah Quint, who would have been played by Moss. However, once J.J. Abrams took over directing the project, the character was scrapped.After a dispute over the film\\'s tone, Carnahan quit in July 2004. Tom Cruise then called J. J. Abrams, offering the directorial role for the film after having binge-watched the first two seasons of Alias. Abrams ultimately signed on and production was delayed a year due to his contractual obligations with Alias and Lost. During this time, Branagh, Moss, and Johansson departed from the project because of the many delays in production. On June 8, 2005, Paramount Pictures gave the film the green-light after a new cast of actors was hired and the film\\'s budget was redeveloped, and Cruise took a major pay cut.\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography began in Rome, Italy on July 12, 2005 and ended in October. Location filming took place in China (Shanghai and Xitang), Germany (Berlin), Italy (Rome and Caserta), the United States (California, Virginia and Maryland), and Vatican City. The night scenes involving the skyscrapers were filmed in Shanghai, while some of the Shanghai filming was also done in Los Angeles.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe film\\'s musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino. He is the third composer to take on the series, following Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer. The score album was released on May 9, 2006 by Varèse Sarabande Records. Unlike the previous installments, no soundtrack album featuring the film\\'s contemporary music was released. Despite this, the film features a song by Kanye West entitled \"Impossible\" that also features Twista, Keyshia Cole and BJ.\\n\\nDistribution\\nMarketing\\nTo promote the film, Paramount rigged 4,500 randomly selected Los Angeles Times vending boxes with digital audio players which would play the theme song when the door was opened. The audio players did not always stay concealed, and in many cases came loose and fell on top of the stack of newspapers in plain view, with the result that they were widely mistaken for bombs. Police bomb squads detonated a number of the vending boxes and even temporarily shut down a veterans hospital in response to the apparent \"threat\". Despite these problems, Paramount and the Los Angeles Times opted to leave the audio players in the boxes until two days after the movie\\'s opening.\\n\\n\"Trapped in the Closet\" controversy\\nA blog entry of Hollywoodinterrupted.com in March 2006 alleged that Viacom (parent of Paramount and Comedy Central) canceled the rebroadcast of the South Park episode \"Trapped in the Closet\" due to threats by Cruise to refuse to participate in the Mission: Impossible III publicity circle. These assertions were soon also reported by E! News and American Morning.Fox News attributed threats from Cruise, stating, \"to back out of his Mission: Impossible III promotional duties if Viacom didn\\'t pull a repeat of the episode\", as evidence of \"bad blood\" between Cruise and Viacom. The Washington Post reported that South Park fans \"struck back\", in March 2006, and threatened to boycott Mission: Impossible III until Comedy Central put \"Trapped in the Closet\" back on its schedule. Melissa McNamara of CBS News later questioned whether this boycott hurt the film\\'s box office debut. Political blogger Andrew Sullivan encouraged a boycott of the film, based on claims that Cruise allegedly forced Comedy Central to censor a South Park episode about Scientologists. \"Make sure you don\\'t go see Paramount\\'s Mission: Impossible III, Cruise\\'s upcoming movie,\" Sullivan wrote. \"I know you weren\\'t going to see it anyway. But now any money you spend on this movie is a blow against freedom of speech. Boycott it. Tell your friends to boycott it.\"When asked in ABC\\'s Primetime about his involvement with stopping the episode rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated \"First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here\\'s the thing: I\\'m really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn\\'t really even know about it. I\\'m working, making my movie, I\\'ve got my family. I\\'m busy. I don\\'t spend my days going, \\'What are people saying about me?\\'\"\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nOpening in 4,054 theaters all across the United States, the fourth largest opening ever up to that point, the film topped the box office in its opening weekend. It made $16.6 million on its opening day and $47.7 million in its opening weekend, a solid opening yet almost $10 million lower than the franchise\\'s previous films. The film remained at number one with $25 million during its second weekend, ahead of Poseidon\\'s gross of $22.2 million. The film remained in the Top 10 at the box office for the remainder of its first six weeks. It ended its initial domestic run on July 20, 2006, taking in a total of $134 million. It was the second movie in 2006 to pass the $100,000,000 mark in the box office, following Ice Age: The Meltdown. The $134 million domestic run was significantly lower than that of Mission: Impossible 2.Outside the US, the film grossed $70 million during its first five days (in some Asian countries, it opened two days ahead of its North American release date) and was easily the box-office champion in many countries. As of 2017, its international box office gross has reached $263.8 million for a combined worldwide gross of $397.8 million, the lowest so far of the series and the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2006.In the Netherlands, the film debuted at No. 1 in the week of May 4–10, grossing a total of € 532,384. The following week, the film remained on the top position. In its third, the film dropped to No. 2 and fell to No. 4 to the following week. Next, it maintained the No. 4 position to drop to No. 6 (in the week of June 6 - June 14). In total, the film has grossed over €2,141,162. Mission Impossible III took less than half at the box office than Fallout and to date Mission Impossible III is the lowest-grossing film in the series.\\n\\nCritical response\\nOn the film-critics aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Mission: Impossible III received 71% positive reviews from critics and an average of 6.6/10, based on 224 reviews. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Fast-paced, with eye-popping stunts and special effects, the latest Mission: Impossible installment delivers everything an action fan could ask for. A thrilling summer popcorn flick.\" It holds a similar rating on Metacritic, with an average score of 66/100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" based on a normalized average of 42 reviews.

              " 'Mission: Impossible – Fallout': 'Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a 2018  action spy film written, produced, and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. It is the sixth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series, and the second film to be directed by McQuarrie following the 2015 film Rogue Nation, making him the first director to direct more than one film in the franchise. The cast includes Tom Cruise,\\nVing Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Michelle Monaghan, and Alec Baldwin all of whom reprise their roles from the previous films, along with Henry Cavill, Vanessa Kirby, and Angela Bassett, who join the franchise. In the film, Ethan Hunt and his team must track down missing plutonium while being monitored by a CIA agent after a mission goes wrong.\\nTalks for a sixth Mission: Impossible film began prior to the release of Rogue Nation in 2015. The film was officially announced in November 2015, with McQuarrie confirming his return as writer and director, as well as producer alongside J. J. Abrams and Cruise, the seventh collaboration between the pair. Jeremy Renner confirmed that he was unable to appear in the film due to scheduling conflicts with Avengers: Endgame. Filming took place from April 2017 to March 2018, in Paris, London, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Arab Emirates. Production was notably put on-hold for two months following an injury to Cruise in August 2017.\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout had its world premiere in Paris on July 12, 2018, and was released in the United States on July 27, 2018; it was the first in the series to be released in RealD 3D, and also had an IMAX release. It grossed $791 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of Cruise\\'s career, and the highest-grossing film in the franchise, surpassing Ghost Protocol. It received critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay, cinematography, action sequences, stunts, musical score and acting, and is considered by many critics to be the best installment in the franchise.Two untitled sequels, one of them being Mission: Impossible 7, are both scheduled to be released in November 2021 and 2022, respectively, both directed by McQuarrie.\\n\\nPlot\\nTwo years after anarchist Solomon Lane\\'s capture, the remnants of his organization of rogue clandestine operatives, the Syndicate, continue to wreak havoc around the globe and have reorganized as a terrorist group known as the Apostles. They are allied with a mysterious extremist known as John Lark, who wrote a manifesto calling for the destruction of the current world order.\\nAt a safe house in Belfast, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in Berlin from Eastern European gangsters, before the Apostles can. He is joined by Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell for the mission, but the team fails when Stickell is captured. Hunt\\'s attempt to save Stickell allows agents of the arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis (aka the White Widow) to seize the plutonium. The IMF team later captures nuclear weapons expert Nils Delbruuk, whose security clearance was revoked due to his anti-religious bigotry, and who designed nuclear bombs for the Apostles. Delbruuk explains the Apostles\\' credo that \"there has never been great peace without first a great suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.\" Using a fake broadcast of Dunn posing as Wolf Blitzer, they trick Delbruuk into unlocking a phone that he used to communicate with Lark.\\nFurious at the IMF\\'s failure to secure the plutonium, CIA Director Erika Sloane instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker to shadow Hunt as he attempts to retrieve it. Hunt and Walker infiltrate a nightclub party in Paris where Lark is believed to be buying the cores from Mitsopolis, who is acting as the middleman in the sale of the plutonium. They track a man whom they suspect to be Lark, but after fighting him in a restroom, the man is killed by MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. Hunt assumes the role of Lark without a disguise, and escapes from hitmen sent to kill both Lark and Mitsopolis.\\nIn exchange for the plutonium, Mitsopolis tasks Hunt with extracting Lane from an armored convoy moving through Paris. She provides one of the plutonium cores as a down payment. To prevent Mitsopolis and her brother Zola from killing local police, Hunt and Walker preemptively attack the convoy. Ramming Lane\\'s vehicle into water, they lead police and Mitsopolis\\'s men on a chase across Paris while Dunn and Stickell, in a watercraft, secure Lane. Faust reappears and attempts to kill Lane to prove her loyalty to MI6, but the extraction is successful. Mitsopolis instructs Hunt to deliver both Lane and Faust to London.\\nAt a London safe house, IMF Secretary Alan Hunley reveals evidence doctored by Walker and passed to Sloane, stating Hunt is the real Lark. Eventually, Hunt, the team, and Hunley trick Walker into admitting he is the real Lark and inform Sloane, who sends in a CIA unit to take everyone into custody for transfer to Washington, D.C. However, the CIA unit had been infiltrated by the Apostles, and Walker orders the infiltrators to attack. Walker kills Hunley and escapes, after Hunt chases him across London. As he departs for India with Lane, Walker instructs Hunt to turn himself in and admit that he is Lark or else Hunt\\'s ex-wife Julia will be harmed.\\nThe team deduces that Lane and Walker plan to detonate the remaining two nuclear bombs at a medical camp over the Siachen Glacier, contaminating the water supply of India, Pakistan, and China; with a third of its population affected, the world will descend into an anarchy from which the Apostles hope a new world order will emerge. As the bombs are linked by a failsafe, any attempt to defuse one bomb without the detonator, automatically triggers the other.\\nUpon arrival in Kashmir, Hunt discovers Julia and her new husband Erik are assigned to the medical camp, an arrangement made by Walker to increase the pressure on Hunt. Lane programs the bombs\\' detonator with a 15-minute countdown and gives it to Walker, choosing to remain behind with the bombs. Walker takes off, secretly pursued by Hunt while Dunn, Stickell, and Faust try to find and defuse the nuclear weapons. Stickell attempts to deactivate the first bomb with Julia\\'s help, but they are unable to without the detonator. Faust and Dunn find the second bomb and are ambushed by Lane and subdue him after an intense fight. Following an aerial chase, Hunt uses a commandeered helicopter to ram Walker\\'s helicopter out of the sky. After a fight on a cliff, Walker is killed. Hunt then secures the detonator, allowing the team to deactivate the nukes.\\nIn the aftermath, Sloane hands Lane over to MI6 through Mitsopolis, with Faust earning her exoneration. Julia tells Hunt that he has given her the best life, despite his commitment to the IMF. Faust and the team join Hunt in celebration.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent and leader of a team of operatives\\nHenry Cavill as August Walker, a CIA assassin working for the Special Activities Division tasked with monitoring Ethan and his team\\nVing Rhames as Luther Stickell, an IMF agent and a member of Hunt\\'s team and his closest friend\\nRebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, a former MI6 agent who allied with Hunt\\'s team during Rogue Nation\\nSimon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent and a member of Hunt\\'s team\\nSean Harris as Solomon Lane, an anarchist mastermind who was the leader of the Syndicate during Rogue Nation\\nVanessa Kirby as Alanna Mitsopolis, a black-market arms dealer also known as the White Widow.

Wolf Blitzer makes a cameo appearance as himself, a disguise worn by Dunn.\\n\\nProduction\\nPre-production\\nOn May 23, 2015, The Tracking Board reported that Paramount Pictures was developing a sixth Mission: Impossible film, with Tom Cruise, J. J. Abrams, David Ellison, and Dana Goldberg returning to produce, along with Don Granger and Matt Grimm as executive producers, and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development. On July 28, 2015, Cruise confirmed on The Daily Show that a sixth film was already being developed, and told its host Jon Stewart that the filming would \"probably\" commence in summer 2016. On August 2, 2015, Paramount executive Rob Moore told Variety that the sequel was already in the works, stating that they were \"very happy to be developing this movie with Tom,\" and \"there has to be another movie.\" On November 19, 2015, it was announced that Paramount had again hired Christopher McQuarrie to write the film, while it was possible that he would also direct again, and the studio was moving fast, with plans to begin shooting in August 2016. On November 30, 2015, McQuarrie confirmed through his Twitter account that he would be back for directing duty as well, and also produce the film along with Cruise. \\nOn August 19, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Paramount had halted pre-production on the film due to a dispute over salary between Cruise and the studio, as Cruise wanted to be paid equal to or more than his fee for the Universal Pictures film The Mummy. On September 16, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Cruise\\'s dispute with the studio had been resolved, and production would now begin in spring 2017. In November, Jeremy Renner—who portrayed William Brandt in the fourth and fifth films—stated that he was unsure if he would be part of the sixth film, due to scheduling conflicts with Marvel Studios\\' Avengers: Endgame (2019). In March 2017, it was confirmed at CinemaCon that he would not return for the sixth film.In February, McQuarrie revealed that the film would include more backstory to Ethan Hunt\\'s personal life. On June 13, 2017, Michelle Monaghan was announced to return as Ethan Hunt\\'s wife Julia Meade-Hunt.\\n\\nFilming\\nFilming was slated to start in Paris on April 10, 2017. Other locations included London, New Zealand and Norway. Filming officially began on April 8. Some of the filming also took place in New Zealand in July 2017. The municipality of Forsand in Norway allowed the closing of Preikestolen for a time in autumn for the film\\'s shoot; only crew members and cast were allowed to approach the mountain for nine consecutive days. They also were allowed up to 50 helicopter landings per day. The scenes set in the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir were shot in New Zealand. Director Christopher McQuarrie said that he wanted the climax of the film to be set in a more \"politically complex\" location than New Zealand, so he chose to set this sequence in Kashmir.In August 2017, Cruise injured his right leg on the London set during filming. Following the accident, the studio announced it would halt production for at least nine weeks in order for Cruise\\'s broken ankle and other injuries to heal, but released a statement saying that they would be keeping the July 2018 release date for the film. The injury resulted in a cost of around $80 million for the studio, because they had to pay the cast and crew for the eight-week hiatus so they would not take another job. However, the injury and subsequent costs were offset by insurance, and did not count against the film\\'s final budget. Filming resumed in early October 2017, with Cruise spotted on the set seven weeks after his initial injury, and two weeks earlier than initially planned.Reshoots for Cavill\\'s Justice League coincided with the schedule for Fallout, for which he had grown a mustache which he was contracted to keep while filming. While McQuarrie initially gave the producers of Justice League permission to have Cavill shave the mustache in exchange for the $3 million it would cost to shut down production on Fallout and then digitally fill the mustache in, executives from Paramount rejected the idea, forcing Justice League\\'s VFX team to use special effects to digitally remove the mustache in post-production.On January 25, 2018, the title was revealed to be Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Filming wrapped in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on March 25, 2018. Production in the UAE included filming of a High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) jump scene with Cruise. The scene required Cruise and the crew to train on a ground-based vertical wind tunnel, and then use a C-17 military aircraft to make over one hundred jumps from around 25,000 feet (7,600 m) to end up with three takes that McQuarrie wanted for the film. As the scene was to be set near sunset, they could only make one jump a day to try to get each shot. One of the biggest challenges for the visual effects team was replacing the Abu Dhabi desert with Paris, which is where the jump takes place in the film. Artists re-created the Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées using reference imagery, Lidar scans, and photogrammetry from drone footage that was taken above the building.\\n\\nVisual effects\\nThe visual effects were provided by DNEG and Blind LTD and supervised by Huw Evans, Andrew Booth and Jody Johnson with the help of One of Us and The Third Floor.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe musical score for Mission: Impossible – Fallout was composed by Lorne Balfe. Balfe was confirmed by McQuarrie to be the composer for the film in April 2018, replacing the previous composer Joe Kraemer.The score has been praised by many critics, calling it an epic and inspiring score, with some powerful themes which are balanced with softer more sentimental themes; some also considered it being too \"Nolan-esque\", comparing it to scores by Hans Zimmer (particularly The Dark Knight Rises). The score implements the use of percussion, snares, and bongos to create a jaunty staccato momentum.\\nThe digital album was released through Paramount Music on July 14, 2018. The physical soundtrack was released later in the month by La-La Land Records.\\n\\nAll music is composed by Lorne Balfe.\\n\\nRelease\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout was released in the United States and Canada on July 27, 2018, by Paramount in RealD 3D, IMAX, and IMAX 3D, and August 31, 2018 in China. The film premiered in Paris on July 12, 2018.The first trailer was released on February 4, 2018, during Super Bowl LII, and a second one on May 16, 2018. Marketing spent a total of $140 million on global promotion and advertisements. The film was released in India with some edits to exclude any mention of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.\\n\\nHome media\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout was released for digital download on November 20, 2018 and was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 4, 2018. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, a deleted scenes montage, an isolated score, and three commentary tracks.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout grossed $220.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $571 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $791.1 million, against a production budget of $178 million, becoming Mission: Impossible\\'s highest-grossing film.In the United States and Canada, Fallout was released alongside Teen Titans Go! To the Movies, and was projected to gross $48–65 million in its opening weekend, with some estimates going as high as $75 million. It opened in 4,386 theaters, the most ever for the franchise and the seventh-widest release all time. The film made $6 million from Thursday night previews (including $1 million from IMAX screenings), the highest of the series, a record for Cruise, and a 50% increase from Rogue Nation\\'s $4 million. It went on to debut to $61.2 million, the best of the series and the second-highest of Cruise\\'s career. It made $35 million in its second weekend to remain in first, and marked the best sophomore frame of the franchise. The film made $20 million in its third weekend, finishing second behind newcomer The Meg.In other territories, the film was projected to debut to $75–80 million from 36 countries, for an estimated total global opening of around $135 million. It made $15 million on its first day, including $2.8 million in South Korea. The film ended up overperforming, debuting to $92 million overseas for a worldwide total of $153.5 million. Its largest markets were China ($181 million), South Korea ($24.9 million), the United Kingdom ($9.5 million), and India ($8.2 million).

The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Fast, sleek, and fun, Mission: Impossible – Fallout lives up to the \\'impossible\\' part of its name by setting yet another high mark for insane set pieces in a franchise full of them.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 84% overall positive score and a 65% \"definite recommend,\" while CinemaScore reported filmgoers gave it an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the highest ever for the series.Variety\\'s Peter Debruge called the film \"the series\\' most exciting installment yet,\" saying, \"McQuarrie clearly believes in creating coherent set pieces: His combat scenes are tense, muscular, and clean, shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense.\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a grade of \"A\" and called it one of the best action films ever, writing \"He\\'s only Tom Cruise because nobody else is willing to be—or maybe he\\'s only Tom Cruise so that nobody else has to be. Either way, Fallout is the film he\\'s always promised us, and it is worth the wait.\" Entertainment Weekly\\'s Chris Nashawaty also gave the film an \"A\" grade, commenting on Cruise that \"He\\'s still Hollywood\\'s hungriest movie star\", with the series getting \"better, twistier and more deliriously fun with each installment\". George Simpson of The Express complimented \"the action is brutal and gut-punching, the pacing heart-pumping and the stakes so high it\\'s gasp-inducing at times,\" adding, \"Fallout is an improvement on all the previous films\\' failings, drawing together all the best aspects of them; simultaneously giving off that classic vibe of the original while never being afraid to continually evolve;\" he gave the film five out of five stars. The Telegraph\\'s Tim Robey summed up the film as \"spectacular and eye-popping,\" deeming it \"the blockbuster of the summer\" with \"a pleasingly sinuous plot,\" and calling the film and its series a \"Bond-like franchise\"; he also rated the film five out of five stars.Robert Abele of TheWrap described Cruise as an \"evergreen movie star with the daredevil heart of a stuntman\" and that he \"puts every ounce of effort he can into the long, hard work of maintaining a blockbuster franchise.\" The Hollywood Reporter\\'s Todd McCarthy praised director Christopher McQuarrie, saying that with Mission: Impossible – Fallout he \"tops what he did with Cruise three years ago,\" and also singled out Vanessa Kirby for playing her character with \"a mix of elegance and frisky abandon.\" J.R. Kinnard of PopMatters wrote, \"Though it lacks the gritty humanity of something like George Miller\\'s Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Mission: Impossible – Fallout is no less impressive in its dedication to character-driven action and practical special effects. It\\'s a dazzling, non-stop thriller that\\'s sure to become an instant action classic.\" Screen Daily\\'s Tim Grierson wrote \"Tom Cruise is on fighting form in this thrilling franchise topper... [he is] ageless, riveting and seemingly unstoppable,\" further adding that \"the sixth film in the series is among the most outstanding, delivering a near-exhausting amount of stupendous action sequences paired with deft character drama and the requisite life-or-death stakes.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"there isn\\'t as much [humor] in the dialogue as before,\" but added, \"Crashes and petrolhead spills are what this franchise is reasonably expected to deliver. And this is what it cheerfully does.\"Sight & Sound\\'s Nick Pinkerton wrote \"A strong contender for the most consistently cinematic franchise of the last 25 years, the Mission: Impossible films also offer a case study in the idea of the actor as auteur, with Tom Cruise continuing to present himself as a fearless screen immortal in Fallout.\"The film was listed in 53 critics Top 10 films of 2018.\\n\\nAccolades\\nSequels\\nIt was announced by Cruise on January 14, 2019 that the seventh and eighth Mission: Impossible films will be shot back-to-back with McQuarrie writing and directing both films for November 19, 2021 and November 4, 2022 release.

In November 2019, McQuarrie announced that Pom Klementieff had joined the cast for the seventh and eighth films. In late December Shea Whigham was confirmed for both upcoming movies. In January 2020, McQuarrie announced that Nicholas Hoult had also joined the cast. However, Hoult dropped out of both movies due to scheduling conflicts, and was replaced by Esai Morales in May 2020. In February 2020, McQuarrie announced that Henry Czerny will be returning as Eugene Kittridge in both sequels. In June 2020, it was announced that filming for the seventh installment had been delayed, and would take place in September, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout at IMDb',\n",
              " 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol': 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is a 2011 American action spy film directed by Brad Bird and written by Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec. It is the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series, and also Bird\\'s first live-action film. It stars Tom Cruise, who reprises his role of Impossible Missions Force agent Ethan Hunt, alongside Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, Michael Nyqvist, Anil Kapoor and Léa Seydoux. In the film, Hunt and his team race against time to find a nuclear extremist who gains access to Russian nuclear launch codes when a mission by Hunt\\'s team goes wrong, resulting in the bombing of Kremlin. The IMF is implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to enact \"Ghost Protocol\", disavowing the organization, leaving Hunt and his team without back up. Ghost Protocol was produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams, (the third film\\'s director) and Bryan Burk. It saw the return of editor Paul Hirsch and visual effects supervisor John Knoll from the first film, and is also the first Mission: Impossible film to be partially filmed using IMAX cameras.\\nReleased in the United States by Paramount Pictures on December 16, 2011, the film went on to become the highest-grossing film in the series, with $694 million, until it was surpassed by Mission: Impossible – Fallout. It is the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2011 as well as the second-highest-grossing film starring Cruise. It was followed by Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which was released in July 2015. The film received positive reviews on Metacritic, and Rotten Tomatoes calls it \"popcorn entertainment that really works\".\\n\\nPlot\\nIMF agent Trevor Hanaway is killed in Budapest by assassin Sabine Moreau, who takes his file containing Russian nuclear launch codes so she can give them to a man known only as \"Cobalt\".\\nIMF agent Ethan Hunt has purposely become incarcerated in a Moscow prison to acquire Bogdan, a source of information on Cobalt. With the help of Jane Carter, Hanaway\\'s handler, and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn, Hunt and Bogdan make their escape. IMF tasks Hunt to infiltrate the Kremlin to gain more information on Cobalt. During the mission, an insider broadcasts the IMF team about a supposed detonation, thereby alerting the Kremlin Police. Hunt\\'s team aborts the mission just as a bomb destroys much of the Kremlin. Carter and Dunn escape, but Hunt is captured by SVR agent Anatoly Sidorov and charged with destroying the Kremlin.\\nHunt escapes and meets with the IMF Secretary in Moscow on other business. The Secretary tells Hunt that the President had initiated \"Ghost Protocol\", disavowing IMF, but secretly orders Hunt to continue to pursue Cobalt. Sidorov\\'s forces catch up to Hunt, and the Secretary is killed. Hunt escapes along with the Secretary\\'s aide and intelligence analyst William Brandt. Brandt is able to identify Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a Swedish-born Russian nuclear strategist, who seeks to start a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia. Hendricks used the Kremlin bombing to cover up his theft of a Russian launch-control device, and now is planning a trade with Moreau at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai to gain the required launch codes.\\nThe team travels to Dubai. On the 119th floor of the hotel, they create deceptions using their various gadgetry and disguises to make Moreau believe she is meeting with Hendricks, and vice versa, when in fact they are interacting with the IMF team. Moreau discovers the deception, and in the ensuing chaos, Hendricks manages to escape with the launch codes, evading Hunt\\'s pursuit in the midst of a dust storm. As Moreau tries to escape, she is knocked out of a window by Carter and falls to her death. Brandt accuses Carter of doing this as retribution for Moreau\\'s murder of Hanaway, thus compromising the mission, but Hunt recognizes that Brandt has also been keeping secrets from them, having shown combat skills atypical of a mere analyst. Hunt leaves to meet with Bogdan to get more information on Hendricks, while Brandt tells the others that he had been assigned to secretly protect Ethan and his wife Julia in Croatia. Julia had been killed by a hit squad and Brandt feels responsible for Ethan\\'s loss, which is why he stopped being a field agent.\\nBogdan directs Ethan towards Mumbai, where Hendricks is set to negotiate with Indian billionaire entrepreneur Brij Nath to gain control of an obsolete Soviet military satellite. The IMF team splits up to stop Hendricks; Carter sexually seduces Nath to get the satellite override code, while Hunt, Brandt and Dunn try to stop Hendricks from using Nath\\'s broadcast station. They are too late as Hendricks has sent the launch codes to a Russian Delta III-class nuclear submarine to fire a single missile at San Francisco and disabled the station\\'s computer systems. Brandt and Dunn race to get the systems back online to send the override code, while Hunt pursues Hendricks, eventually having a brutal brawl with him face to face in an automated car park. Hendricks, with the launch device, jumps to his death moments before the missile is set to land. Hunt then uses one of the cars and takes a dangerous fall to use the device; he barely disables the missile before it strikes. Sidorov, who has followed IMF from Dubai to Mumbai, arrives and realizes that the IMF is innocent of the Kremlin bombing.\\nThe team meets in Seattle after Ethan accepts a new mission from Luther Stickell. Brandt confesses to Ethan about his failure to protect Julia. Ethan, however, reveals that her \"death\" and the murder of the Serbians were part of a plot to give her a new identity and enable Ethan to infiltrate the prison. A relieved Brandt happily accepts his mission, and becomes an agent once again. Meanwhile, Julia arrives at the harbor. Ethan and Julia gaze at each other, smiling, from afar before Ethan departs for his next mission.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDespite Mission: Impossible III earning less than its predecessors at the box office, its critical reception was much better than the second film and Paramount Pictures was keen on developing a fourth in the series. In August 2009, Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec were hired to write the film\\'s screenplay. Because of other commitments, J. J. Abrams said that it was unlikely for him to return as director but made note that he will produce the film alongside Tom Cruise. By March 2010, director Brad Bird was in talks of directing the film with Cruise returning to star as Ethan Hunt.The film was originally announced with a working name of Mission: Impossible 4 and code-named \"Aries\" during early production. By August 2010, title considerations did not include the Mission: Impossible 4 name, and thought was given to omitting the specific term \"Mission: Impossible\", which Variety compared to Christopher Nolan\\'s Batman sequel film The Dark Knight. In late October 2010, the title was confirmed as Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.\\nChristopher McQuarrie (who later directed Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Fallout) did an uncredited rewrite of the screenplay, explaining that: On Ghost Protocol I came in on the middle of the shoot to do a rewrite of the screenplay, though they had already started the movie. I had to communicate with the entire staff to determine what I could and couldn\\'t change, what sets had been built or struck, what scenes I could or couldn\\'t reshoot. I learned so much about production being right there. ... The script had these fantastic sequences in it but there was a mystery in it that was very complicated. What I did was about clarity. The mystery had to be made simpler. It\\'s like reaching into a sock and pulling it inside out. It\\'s still a sock, still all the same pieces, but all put together in a different order.\\n\\nFilming\\nThe film was partially shot with IMAX cameras, which made up approximately 30 minutes of the film\\'s run time. Bird insisted that certain scenes of the film be shot in IMAX, as opposed to 3D, as he felt that the IMAX format offered the viewer more immersion due to its brighter, higher quality image, which is projected on a larger screen, without the need for specialised glasses. Bird also believed that the IMAX format would bring back \"a level of showmanship\" to the presentation of Hollywood films, which he believes the industry has lost due to its emphasis on screening films in multiplexes as opposed to grand theaters, and vetoing \"first runs\" in favor of wider initial releases.\\nPrincipal photography took place from October 2010 to March 19, 2011. Filming took place in Budapest, Mumbai, Prague, Moscow, Vancouver, Bangalore, Chennai, and Dubai. Although Cruise appears to be free solo climbing in the film with the help of special gloves, in reality, he was securely attached to the Burj Khalifa at all times by multiple cables. Industrial Light & Magic digitally erased the cables in post-production. Following Cruise\\'s example, Patton and Seydoux also chose to forgo the use of stunt doubles for their fight scene at the Burj Khalifa where Carter exacts her revenge upon Moreau for Hanaway\\'s death.Many of the film\\'s interior scenes were shot at Vancouver\\'s Canadian Motion Picture Park Studios, including a key transition scene in a specially equipped IMF train car and the fight between Hunt and Hendricks in a Mumbai automated multi-level parking garage (which was constructed over a six-month period just for the film). The Vancouver Convention Centre was modified to double as downtown Bangalore. The film\\'s opening Moscow prison escape scenes were shot on location in a real former prison near Prague.Bird, having directed several Disney and Pixar films and short films, incorporated the trademark \"A113\" into the film on two separate occasions. The first is the design print on Hanaway\\'s ring during the flashback sequence, and the second being when Hunt calls in for support and uses the drop callsign, Alpha 1–1–3.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe musical score for Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol was composed by Michael Giacchino, who also composed the music for the third film and collaborated with Bird on The Incredibles and Ratatouille. As in previous installments, the score incorporates Lalo Schifrin\\'s themes from the original television series. \"Lalo is an amazing jazz writer. You know you can\\'t write a straight-up jazz score for a film like this but you can certainly hint at it here and there,\" said Giacchino, explaining the stylistic influence generated by Schifrin\\'s history with the franchise. A soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande on January 10, 2012.\\nAll music is composed by Michael Giacchino.\\n\\nDistribution\\nMarketing\\nIn July 2011, a teaser trailer for Ghost Protocol was released illustrating new shots from the film, one of which being Tom Cruise scaling the world\\'s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Moreover, prior to its release, the studio presented IMAX footage of the film to an invitation-only crowd of opinion makers and journalists at central London\\'s BFI IMAX theater. One of the many scenes that were included was a chase scene in a Dubai desert sandstorm.During November 2011, the Paramount released a Facebook game of the film in order to promote it. The new game allowed players to choose the roles of IMF agents and assemble teams to embark on a multiplayer journey. Players were also able to garner tickets to the film\\'s U.S. premiere and a hometown screening of the film for 30 friends.\\n\\nTheatrical release\\nFollowing the world premiere in Dubai on December 7, 2011, the film was released in IMAX and other large-format theaters in the U.S. on December 16, 2011, with general release on December 21, 2011.\\n\\nHome media\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital download on April 17, 2012. The home media releases, however, do not preserve the original IMAX imagery, and its aspect ratio is consistently cropped to 2.40:1 rather than switching to a 1.78:1 aspect ratio during the IMAX scenes. Blu-ray Disc releases such as The Dark Knight, Tron: Legacy, and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will switch between 2.40:1 for regular scenes and 1.78:1 for IMAX scenes. The film was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on June 26, 2018.\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 239 reviews and an average rating of 7.7/10. The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes reads: \"Stylish, fast-paced, and loaded with gripping set pieces, the fourth Mission: Impossible is big-budget popcorn entertainment that really works.\". Metacritic assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100 based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of four stars, saying the film \"is a terrific thriller with action sequences that function as a kind of action poetry.\" Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger wrote \"The eye-candy—from high-tech gadgets to gorgeous people—has only been ratcheted up. And so has the excitement.\" He also gave the film 3.5 out of four stars. Giving the film three out of four stars, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said \"In its way, the movie has old-Hollywood elegance. The scope and sets are vast, tall, and cavernous, but Bird scales down for spatial intimacy.\"Philippa Hawker of The Sydney Morning Herald gave the film three stars out of five and said it is \"ludicrously improbable, but also quite fun.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly opined that the movie \"brims with scenes that are exciting and amazing at the same time; they\\'re brought off with such casual aplomb that they\\'re funny, too. ... Ghost Protocol is fast and explosive, but it\\'s also a supremely clever sleight-of-hand thriller. Brad Bird, the animation wizard, ... showing an animator\\'s miraculously precise use of visual space, has a playful, screw-tightening ingenuity all his own.\" Roger Moore of The Charlotte Observer gave the film three out of four stars; said \"Brad Bird passes his audition for a career as a live-action director. And Ghost Protocol more than makes its bones as an argument for why Tom Cruise should continue in this role as long as his knees, and his nerves, hold up.\"IndieWire ranked it as one of the best action movies of the 21st century.\\n\\nBox office\\nGhost Protocol grossed $209.4 million in North America and $485.3 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $694.7 million. It is the second-highest-grossing film worldwide in the Mission: Impossible series, and the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2011. It is also the second-highest-grossing film worldwide starring Cruise, surpassing War of the Worlds from the top spot. It was the franchise\\'s highest-grossing film and Cruise\\'s biggest film at the time of release, before being surpassed by Mission: Impossible – Fallout seven years later.\\nIn limited release at 425 locations in North America, it earned $12.8 million over its opening weekend. After five days of limited release, it expanded to 3,448 theaters on its sixth day and reached #1 at the box office with $8.92 million. The film reached the top stop at the box office in its second and third weekends with $29.6 million and $29.4 million, respectively. Though only 9% of the film\\'s screenings were in IMAX theaters, they accounted for 23% of the film\\'s box office.Outside North America, it debuted to a $69.5 million in 42 markets representing approximately 70% of the marketplace. In the United Arab Emirates, it set an opening-weekend record of $2.4 million (since surpassed by Marvel\\'s The Avengers). In two countries outside the U.S. in which filming took place, its opening weekend gross increased by multiples over the previous installment: in Russia, more than doubling, to $6.08 million and in India, more than quadrupling, to $4.0 million. It is the second-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film outside North America. It topped the box office outside North America for three consecutive weekends (during December 2011) and five weekends in total (the other two in 2012). Its highest-grossing markets after North America are China ($102.5 million), Japan ($69.7 million), and South Korea ($51.1 million).\\n\\nAccolades\\nSequel\\nIn December 2011, Pegg suggested that he and Cruise were interested in returning for a fifth Mission: Impossible film. Paramount was also reportedly interested in fast-tracking a fifth film due to the fourth film\\'s success. Bird had stated that he probably would not return to direct a fifth film, but Tom Cruise had been confirmed to return. It was revealed in August 2013 that Christopher McQuarrie would be the director of Mission: Impossible 5. Principal photography began in February 2014 in London. Paramount Pictures released the film on July 31, 2015. The plot centers around Hunt\\'s IMF team in conflict with \"the Syndicate\", an international criminal organization first mentioned at the end of Ghost Protocol.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at IMDb\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at AllMovie\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at Metacritic\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at Box Office Mojo\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at Rotten Tomatoes\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at the TCM Movie Database\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at the American Film Institute Catalog',\n",
              " 'Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation': 'Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation is a 2015 American action spy film written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, from a story by McQuarrie and Drew Pearce and the fifth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. The film stars Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, Sean Harris, Simon McBurney, and Tom Hollander, with Cruise, Renner, Pegg, and Rhames reprising their roles from previous films. Rogue Nation is produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams, and David Ellison of Skydance Productions. In the film, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is on the run from the CIA, following the IMF\\'s dissolution as he tries to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a mysterious global freelance terrorist group composed of many former intelligence officers from many different countries.\\nFilming began on August 21, 2014, in Vienna, Austria, and concluded on March 12, 2015. The film was released in North America by Paramount Pictures on July 31, 2015. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed $682 million worldwide, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2015 as well as the third-highest-grossing film starring Cruise.\\nA sequel, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, was released on July 27, 2018 with McQuarrie returning as writer and director.\\n\\nPlot\\nAfter intercepting nerve gas being sold to Chechen terrorists in Minsk, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is determined to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a consortium of rogue field operatives for various different intelligence agencies turned mercenaries the CIA does not believe exists. As CIA Director Alan Hunley successfully convinces a Senate committee to disband and absorb the IMF, currently without a secretary in charge, into the CIA for its destructive methods and other misconduct, Hunt is captured by the Syndicate at a record shop in London, while their leader, a blond man in glasses, kills the female IMF agent stationed there. Hunt escapes a torture chamber led by Syndicate member Janik \"Bone Doctor\" Vinter with the help of disavowed MI6 agent and now Syndicate operative Ilsa Faust. IMF Field Operations Director William Brandt, knowing Hunley will try to capture Hunt, warns him to stay undercover. Cut off from the IMF, Hunt follows his only lead: the man in glasses, later identified as former MI6 agent Solomon Lane.\\nSix months later, Hunt, still a fugitive living in Paris (luring a CIA team to a decoy safe house in Havana), enlists former colleague Benji Dunn to attend the opera Turandot in the Vienna state theater, predicting that an assassination attempt will be made on the Austrian Chancellor at the performance, and that Lane will also be there. The two stop three snipers, including Faust, but the Chancellor is ultimately killed by a car bomb, and Lane is still not found. Faust willingly drops hints of Lane\\'s plan to Hunt before leaving. After learning the Syndicate is working against \"the old world order\" by committing several terrorist acts, Dunn stays with Hunt instead of reporting back to the CIA, despite knowing his action amounts to treason.\\nHunt, blamed for the Chancellor\\'s death, is pursued by the CIA\\'s Special Activities Division. Brandt contacts Luther Stickell to find Hunt before the CIA does. Stickell tracks Hunt, Dunn, and Faust to Casablanca, where the trio break into and acquire a secret Syndicate file from a secure building. Faust flees with the data, evading both Hunt and Syndicate members, although Hunt kills the pursuing agents. Dunn reveals he copied the data onto a second USB drive, as Stickell and Brandt catch up to them.\\nFaust returns to London and attempts to use the file to quit her mission to infiltrate the Syndicate, but her MI6 handler, Atlee, compels her to continue, whilst discreetly wiping her drive. Meanwhile, Hunt learns that the data is an encrypted British government red box that requires the Prime Minister\\'s biometrics to unlock it. They reach London to confront Faust, where Lane\\'s men abduct Dunn, and use Dunn and Faust to blackmail Hunt into decrypting and delivering the data to them. Despite Brandt\\'s protests, Hunt agrees to do so.\\nAs part of Hunt\\'s plan, Brandt reveals their location to Hunley. During a charity auction in Blenheim Palace near Oxford, Hunley, Brandt, and Atlee take the PM to a secure room for the ostensible purpose of protecting him from Hunt. The PM confirms that the Syndicate was a project proposed by Atlee to perform missions without oversight, which would effectively make the PM \"judge, jury and executioner with zero accountability\"; however, the PM adds that he unequivocally rejected the proposal. Atlee then reveals himself as Hunt in a mask and secures the PM\\'s biometrics, allowing Stickell to decrypt the file. When the real Atlee arrives, Hunt forces him to admit that he began the Syndicate without permission and that he has been covering up its existence after Lane hijacked the project and went rogue, turning the Syndicate against him and MI6. Upon discovering the file contains access to £2.4 billion in various bank accounts, serving as the Syndicate\\'s would-be operating budget, Hunt destroys the data.\\nAt his meeting with Lane outside the Tower of London, Hunt tells Lane he has memorized the data and offers himself in exchange for Dunn and Faust. Dunn escapes after the bomb on him is disarmed, while Hunt and Faust are chased through the Tower of London complex by Lane\\'s men. Faust kills Vinter in a knife fight, while Hunt confronts Lane and lures him into a sealed, bulletproof glass cell where he is gassed unconscious and taken into custody. Having witnessed an IMF operation\\'s success firsthand, Hunley later returns with Brandt to the Senate committee and covers for Hunt and his team, convincing the committee to restore the IMF. After the meeting, Brandt congratulates Hunley, who is now the new IMF Secretary.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent\\nSimon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent\\nJeremy Renner as William Brandt, an IMF Field Operations Director\\nRebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, an MI6 agent undercover in the Syndicate\\nVing Rhames as Luther Stickell, an IMF agent, computer specialist and Ethan\\'s closest friend and ally\\nSean Harris as Solomon Lane, a former MI6 agent who went rogue and became the supreme leader of the Syndicate\\nSimon McBurney as Atlee, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service\\nZhang Jingchu as Lauren, a CIA analyst\\nTom Hollander as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\\nJens Hultén as Janik Vinter, a former KGB operative and Lane\\'s second-in-command\\nAlec Baldwin as Alan Hunley, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency\\n\\nProduction\\nPre-production\\nParamount Pictures announced in August 2013 that Christopher McQuarrie would direct the fifth Mission: Impossible film, from a script by Drew Pearce, with Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt. TC Productions and Bad Robot would produce, and Skydance Productions, who served as co-financers and executive producers of the latest installment, will work closely with the team in the development and production process.\" On November 14, 2013, Paramount announced a release date of December 25, 2015. The same month, Simon Pegg confirmed he would reprise his role as Benji. In May 2014, Will Staples replaced Pearce as screenwriter. Also that month, Jeremy Renner confirmed he was returning in the role of William Brandt, and Cruise said the film would shoot in London, with a later report saying it would first shoot in Vienna in August. At some point, McQuarrie replaced Staples as screenwriter; the final credits list McQuarrie as screenwriter, with story by Pearce.\\nIn July 2014, Rebecca Ferguson was cast and Alec Baldwin was in talks for the film. Baldwin was confirmed to have joined the cast in August 2014, and Ving Rhames was confirmed to be reprising his role of Luther Stickell. On September 5, it was announced that Sean Harris was in negotiations for the villain role. On October 2, Simon McBurney joined the cast of the film. On October 6, Chinese actress Zhang Jingchu joined the film\\'s cast (she only appears for 30 seconds in the finished film). On March 22, 2015, Paramount revealed the film\\'s official title, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, along with a teaser poster and trailer.\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography began in August 2014. On August 21, the production released its first photos from the set in Vienna, Austria. In August actors Cruise and Pegg, along with director Christopher McQuarrie, were in Vienna, at the Metro and on the roof-top of Vienna State Opera. After finishing one-and-a-half weeks of filming in Austria, on August 30, Cruise arrived in the Moroccan capital city of Rabat for filming more scenes. Here the Marrakesh Highway was closed for fourteen days (August 30–September 12). Other filming locations in Morocco include Agadir, Rabat and Casablanca. On September 8 and 9, filming took place in the Marrakesh Stadium, which was closed both days for filming purposes, and Kasbah of the Udayas, in Rabat.After more than a month of shooting in Austria and Morocco, filming moved to London on September 28. Filming of an action scene featuring Ethan Hunt climbing and hanging on the outside of a flying Airbus A400M Atlas took place at RAF Wittering near Stamford. Tom Cruise performed the sequence, at times suspended on the aircraft over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) in the air, without the use of a stunt double. To pull off this particular stunt, the production team were given a limited period of only 48 hours. The plane took off and landed 8 times before they had the perfect shot. On November 9, filming began on Southampton Water, and Fawley Power Station. Tom Cruise trained under diving specialist Kirk Krack to be able to hold his breath for three minutes to perform an underwater sequence which was filmed in a single long take without any edits (though the scene in the movie was cut with several breaks, giving the impression for the scene having several takes). However, stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood claims that Cruise held his breath for just over six minutes.On February 20, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter said filming was halted to give McQuarrie, Cruise, and an unknown third person time to rework the film\\'s ending. Filming ended on March 12, 2015.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe musical score for Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation was composed by Joe Kraemer, who previously collaborated with director McQuarrie on The Way of the Gun and Jack Reacher. Kraemer was announced as the composer for the film in September 2014. The soundtrack was recorded with small orchestral sections at British Grove Studios and with full orchestra at Abbey Road Studios.As well as incorporating Lalo Schifrin\\'s thematic material from the television series throughout the score, three tracks (\"Escape to Danger\", \"A Matter of Going\", and \"Finale and Curtain Call\") interpolate Puccini\\'s Nessun dorma aria from his opera Turandot, featured in the opera house scene.\\nThe physical soundtrack became available from La-La Land Records on July 28, 2015, with the digital album released from Paramount Music on the same day.\\n\\nAll music is composed by Joe Kraemer.\\n\\nRelease\\nParamount had originally scheduled the film for a December 25, 2015 release. On January 26, 2015, Paramount advanced the release date to July 31, 2015. The main reason cited by The Hollywood Reporter was to avoid competition with two other 2015 films, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Spectre. In the United States and Canada, it was released in the Dolby Vision format in Dolby Cinema, the first-ever time for Paramount. On February 13, 2015, Paramount and IMAX Corporation announced that they would digitally remaster the film into the IMAX format and release it in IMAX theaters worldwide on the scheduled date. The film was completed at 2:00AM on July 18, 2015, less than two weeks before its release date. The film was officially released in North America on July 31, 2015. Lotte released the film in South Korea on July 30, 2015. The film was released in China on September 8, 2015.In August 2015, Fox Networks acquired the US cable broadcast rights, for broadcast after its theatrical release. The film is available for FX Networks and its suite of networks: FX, FXX, FXM, as well as the video-on-demand platform FXNow.\\n\\nMarketing\\nParamount Pictures spent $42 million on advertising for the film.A comic book was released in conjunction with the film\\'s DVD/Blu-ray release. It follows Hunt going rogue during the events of the film. The comic is written by the film\\'s writer and director Christopher McQuarrie and illustrated by Lazarus artist Owen Freeman.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nMission: Impossible – Rogue Nation grossed $195 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $487.7 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $682.7 million. Although Rogue Nation was projected to become the highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film and the biggest movie for Cruise, it apparently fell short of eclipsing Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol\\'s final gross to become the third-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film and the third-biggest film for Cruise. It had a worldwide opening of $121 million and an IMAX worldwide opening total of $12.5 million (the third-biggest of July behind The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)). Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $108.9 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.\\n\\nUnited States and Canada\\nIn the United States and Canada, according to pre-release tracking, the film was projected to earn around $40–50 million in its opening weekend, less than what the first three Mission: Impossible films earned in their initial weekend. It made $4 million from its Thursday night showings which began at 8 p.m. from 2,764 theaters, and $20.3 million on its opening day, which is the second-biggest opening day for Cruise (behind War of the Worlds) and the biggest in the Mission: Impossible franchise (breaking Mission: Impossible 2\\'s record), with 16% of ticket sales from the film\\'s 367 IMAX theaters. In its opening weekend the film grossed $55.5 million exceeding expectations and is the second-highest opening in the franchise, behind Mission: Impossible 2 ($57.8 million) and the third-biggest for Cruise behind War of the Worlds ($64.8 million) and Mission: Impossible 2. IMAX contributed $8.4 million of the total opening gross from 369 IMAX screens which is the third-best for a July opening after The Dark Knight Rises ($19 million) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 ($15.2 million). Premium large format grossed up $2.6 million, 13% of Friday\\'s gross with Cinemark XD grossing close to $700,000 at 108 screens. It remained at the top spot for the second weekend earning an estimated $28.5 million (down 48.7%) from 3,988 theaters (32+ theaters) buoyed by strong word of mouth, rapturous reviews and strong plays at IMAX theaters. Revenues from IMAX also dropped steadily by 39% to $4.3 million in its second weekend. It topped the North American box office for two consecutive weekends until surpassed by the music biographical drama Straight Outta Compton in its third weekend. It ended its theatrical run on October 29, 2015, playing in theaters for a total of 91 days, or 13 weeks, earning a total of $195 million at the North American box office which is just 28.6% of its total worldwide gross. It is the fourth-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film behind Mission: Impossible Fallout ($220 million) , Mission: Impossible 2 ($215 million) and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol ($209 million).\\n\\nOther countries\\nElsewhere, the film opened in 40 international markets including 135 IMAX theaters on July 31, 2015 in big markets such the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Australia. It grossed $64.5 million in its opening weekend and went No. 1 in 33 markets and IMAX contributed $4.1 million of its international opening. Revenues from its second weekend increased by 0.5% to $65 million. It added 18 new markets including India, Japan, and Russia and opened at No. 1 in 17 of the 18 markets with the exception of Japan where it was behind Jurassic World. Overall, it opened at No. 1 in 55 of the 63 territories it has been released in and had the biggest opening weekend ever for the franchise in 46 markets and Cruise\\'s best opening in 40 markets. It topped the box office outside of North America for three consecutive weekends before being overtaken by Paramount\\'s own Terminator Genisys in its fourth weekend and four in total.It had the biggest opening for the franchise in the UK, Ireland and Malta ($8.3 million), France ($7 million), India ($7.5 million), Japan ($6.1 million), Russia and the CIS ($5.3 million), Mexico ($5 million), the Middle East ($4.7; including $2.5 million from UAE alone), Taiwan ($5.1 million), Australia ($3.8 million), Germany ($3.2 million), Brazil ($3.1 million) and Pakistan ($1 million). In South Korea, where the franchise has been a hit it opened to $16.95 million (49% above Ghost Protocol), which is the second-biggest opening ever for Paramount, behind Transformers: Dark of the Moon; Cruise\\'s biggest-ever opening; the best for the Mission: Impossible franchise; and the second-biggest opening for a Western film of 2015. It added $8.1 and $3.7 million in its second and third weekend for a total of $41.1 million making South Korea the film\\'s second-highest market followed by Japan ($41.2 million), the United Kingdom ($32 million), France ($20.9 million), and Germany ($13 million). In Japan, it faced competition with the continued run of Jurassic World. In China, Rogue Nation emerged very successful and earned $18.5 million on its opening day of September 8 (including $1.4 million from midnight screenings), which is the country\\'s biggest opening for a Hollywood 2D film, the second-biggest for any 2D film in China (only behind the $22.2 million debut of local 2D film Pancake Man), and the fifth-biggest opening for any film. Despite opening on a Tuesday—during which most children are off to school—the film opened successfully and almost matched the opening figure of North America. Rob Cain of Forbes cited out possible reasons for the successful opening: the well-establishment of the franchise in China (its immediate predecessor Ghost Protocol earned $102.7 million), rapid expansion and growth of Chinese movie market, being the second Hollywood movie (after Terminator Genisys) to be released after the nearly 60-day blackout period in which non-Chinese movies were dabarred from going to general release in the country, and the successful awareness campaign and marketing efforts by the team including Tom Cruise visiting several Chinese cities. It went on to earn an estimated $85.8 million through its opening weekend (Tuesday–Sunday) from 5,500 screens. It is the highest-grossing 2D Hollywood film there with $136.8 million (breaking Interstellar\\'s record). Rogue Nation was projected to make roughly 70% of its worldwide gross abroad, and indeed ended up making $487,287,762 or 71.4% of its entire worldwide gross overseas which is the second highest among the series.\\n\\nCritical response\\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation has a rating of 94% based on 325 reviews and an average rating of 7.50/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation continues the franchise\\'s thrilling resurgence—and proves that Tom Cruise remains an action star without equal.\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 75 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called the film \"preposterously enjoyable\" and said that it \"unfolds with fluid, twisty, old-school pleasure,\" highlighting the performances of Cruise, Pegg, Ferguson, and Baldwin and comparing the action scenes to those of the James Bond films as well as Alfred Hitchcock\\'s The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). He ultimately gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Rogue Nation 3.5 out of 4 stars, highly praising the film\\'s cast and stating that the film \"keeps topping itself\". However, he criticized the villain for not being too memorable or intimidating. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said that McQuarrie\\'s direction allowed Rogue Nation to stand out among the other films in terms of action and its inclusion of female characters, singling out Ferguson\\'s Ilsa as uniquely empowered and action-oriented, also praising her scenes with Cruise. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic praised Cruise, saying \"You overcome the impossible through the application of sheer, unvarnished willpower, a quality that Cruise has always possessed in abundance\" and describing him as the driving force of the film and the franchise. He, too, praised Ferguson among the supporting cast for her role as an action heroine. Joseph Wigler of MTV.com considered the movie as \"one of the most entertaining Ethan Hunt adventures\" which proves that \"the franchise still has plenty of fight left in it, with no signs of slowing down.\" He praised the performances of Cruise and Ferguson, applauding the latter for playing \"the most fascinating character in the entire movie\" and \"one of the most complicated and alluring characters in the entire five film series.\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times stated \"Sleek and bloated, specific and generic, \\'Rogue Nation\\' is pretty much like most of the \\'Impossible\\' movies in that it\\'s an immense machine that Mr. McQuarrie, after tinkering and oiling, has cranked up again and set humming with twists and turns, global trotting and gadgets, a crack supporting cast and a hard-working star.\"A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club remarked, \"Rather than go full auteur on his formulaic material, McQuarrie instead offers a kind of greatest-hits package: \\'Rogue Nation\\' marries the shifting loyalties of Brian De Palma\\'s original to the kinetic action beats of John Woo\\'s series nadir and the all-set-piece structure of Brad Bird\\'s series zenith, adding an omnipotent villain not far removed from the one Philip Seymour Hoffman played in J.J. Abrams\\' entry. It\\'s the least visually or conceptually distinctive of the five movies, leaning on what\\'s worked before rather than forging its own path.\" Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, calling it \"breathlessly thrilling\" and giving high praise to its action sequences, saying \" all you can do is pick your jaw off your lap and grin at the breathtakingly bananas spectacle you\\'ve just witnessed.\" Meanwhile, David Edelstein of Vulture.com called Ferguson the \"best reason\" to see the film. However, he felt it did not surpass its predecessor and singled out several elements of some of the action sequences for criticism. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal also praised Ferguson but felt that she and Cruise had \"zero chemistry\" onscreen.

              " 'Narc (film)': 'Narc is a 2002 American neo-noir crime thriller film written and directed by Joe Carnahan and starring Jason Patric and Ray Liotta. The plot revolves around the efforts of two police detectives in search of the murderer of an undercover police officer. As they investigate, they engage in unethical behavior and uncover dark secrets that will challenge their fragile relationship.\\n\\nPlot\\nUndercover narcotics officer Nick Tellis chases a drug dealer through the streets of Detroit. Tellis shoots and kills the dealer when he holds a child hostage, but a stray bullet hits the child\\'s pregnant mother, causing her to miscarry. Eighteen months later, Tellis is tasked with investigating the murder of an undercover officer, Michael Calvess. Tellis reluctantly agrees to take the case on two conditions: that he will get a desk job if he secures a conviction, and that he is partnered with Detective Henry Oak, whom Tellis has read about in the Calvess case file. The police chief accepts Tellis\\' conditions, but warns him about Oak\\'s instability.\\nDuring their first meeting, Oak reveals to Tellis his belief that the department wants the Calvess case buried and it is all about politics. The detectives visit the scene where a drug dealer has been shot dead in his bathtub, which Tellis surmises the death was accidental. Tellis notes that the shotgun at the scene is a SWAT weapon with the serial number filed off.\\nWhile the partners have a discussion about family, Oak recalls a drug bust decades prior, where he found a 10-year-old girl who was being sold into prostitution by her stepfather, resulting in Oak beating the man; he sees parallels with the current case. Tellis visits Calvess\\' widow Kathryn, and asks about her relationship with her husband while he was on the street. Oak, who is protective of Calvess\\' family, turns up at the house and angrily confronts Tellis.\\nThe detectives next visit the home of a man involved in Tellis\\' shooting. Although they find no evidence to suggest he murdered Calvess, they find another officer\\'s badge on the premises. The man pulls a gun and wounds Tellis before Oak kills him in self-defense. The case assailant is determined to be Calvess\\' killer and the case is closed. However, Tellis and Oak are furious as they believe the killer is yet to be found, and continue to investigate independently.\\nWhen the detectives visit an auto body shop, Oak attempts to force a confession out of a pair of suspects. Tellis is increasingly suspicious of Oak\\'s tactics. Oak finds police-issue guns in a car belonging to one of the suspects, including one that belonged to Calvess. He beats both men until Tellis tells him to get CSI tools from the car.\\nWhen Oak leaves the room, Tellis locks the door and asks for the truth from the suspects. They explain that Calvess, who had fallen into drug addiction, blew Tellis\\' cover eighteen months before and caused the shooting. On the day of the murder, Calvess tried to deal with the two dealers, but it went badly.\\nOak arrives, having trailed Calvess to confirm rumors that he was an addict. Calvess went for his weapon, which was the dealers\\' justification for attacking him. The two men ran off as Oak shot at them. Tellis confronts Oak and accuses him of murdering Calvess, which Oak denies. Tellis then raises the issue of Oaks\\' relationship with Calvess\\' wife Kathryn.\\nKathryn was the ten-year-old girl who was pimped out by her stepfather. Oak considers her the daughter he never had, and has remained close. He has been protecting her by covering crimes she committed in her teenage years. Tellis tells Oak he will make the arrest, and Oak beats him with the shotgun, and resumes brutalizing the dealers.\\nHe turns the tape recorder on and attempts to beat a confession out of the men, threatening to shoot them. Tellis breaks into their car, retrieves a gun, calls for back-up, and re-enters the building. He shoots Oak when Oak refuses to put his gun down. Tellis moves to aid Oak, and, realizing he\\'s dying, pleads for the truth of what happened the night Calvess died.\\nOak explains that Calvess shot at the dealers as they fled from Oak, leaving the shoulder wound. Oak argued with him, explaining that he had had enough of defending Calvess and would turn him in to the department. In despair, Calvess took his gun and shot himself. Oak had been protecting his name and family, so Calvess\\' wife could receive his pension. Oak\\'s motive was to convict the dealers who he felt made Mike a junkie. Oak dies in Tellis\\' arms, leaving the confession on tape, and Tellis with only moments to decide what to do with it.\\n\\nCast\\nReception\\nBox office\\nNarc opened in the U.S on December 17, 2002 in a limited release in 6 theaters and grossed $63,303 with an average of $10,550 per theater and ranking #45 at the box office.

              " 'ScienTOMogy': 'ScienTOMogy was a New Zealand-based parody site lampooning actor Tom Cruise\\'s involvement with Scientology. Initially hosted at the domain name scientomogy.info, the site was created in 2005 in response to the extensive media publicity surrounding Cruise\\'s appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Today Show.\\nScienTOMogy gained press attention after the site proprietor was contacted by the Church of Scientology with a cease and desist letter, alleging copyright infringement by claiming the word \"Scientomogy\" was too close to the word \"Scientology.\" The proprietor initially agreed to relent to the Church\\'s demands, but then decided to keep the site after consulting with attorneys.  Internet traffic to the site later increased dramatically as a result of the media attention surrounding the Church of Scientology\\'s allegations of copyright infringement.\\n\\nDevelopment\\nNew Zealand webmaster Glen Stollery created scientomogy.info in July 2005, after Tom Cruise appeared on The Today Show in an interview speaking about \"the dangers of prescription drugs,\" and following the incident where he jumped the couch over his love for Katie Holmes during an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The site\\'s stated goal was \"exposing Tom Cruise\\'s moronic behavior in his relentless crusade to promote the Church of Scientology.\"The site was mainly used to store parody and satire material, including depictions of Cruise and Holmes in straitjackets, as well as a video showing Cruise shooting lightning at Oprah Winfrey.  To clarify its position as a parody site, ScienTOMogy contained a disclaimer, which it requested that the reader \"understand and agree to..before continuing.\"  The site\\'s disclaimer stated: \"Obviously www.scienTOMogy.info has ABSOLUTELY NO connection whatsoever with the Church of Scientology, it’s [sic] affiliated organizations or, needless-to-say, Tom Cruise. It is designed for commentary and criticism within the limits of Free Speech. All content should be treated as opinion and all trademarks/copyrighted material herein are owned by their respective trademark owners. The Scientology site is here. Thank you. You may continue..\"  On the site, a fake Cruise claims that the Church of Scientology should refer to itself as \"ScienTOMogy\" instead of Scientology, in order to clear up public relations problems.  The parody version of Cruise states \"It\\'s kind of like the word gummy bears. Bears by themselves are scary, but if you just add the word gummy to it, it now becomes a fun, enjoyable treat.\"\\n\\nChurch of Scientology\\'s response\\nThe Web site drew media attention when the Church of Scientology\\'s attorneys Moxon & Kobrin contacted Stollery, claiming the ScienTOMogy domain name was an infringement of their trademark, despite being a different word by one letter.  In September 2005, the Church of Scientology issued a cease and desist order to Stollery demanding he shut down the site and transfer ownership to the Church, threatening him with a $100,000 lawsuit. The Church\\'s law firm stated that \"ScienTOMogy\" would cause a likelihood of confusion with \"Scientology,\" violating the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1125(a).  The Church of Scientology\\'s letter stated: \"You are hereby on notice that the registration and use of this domain name in this fashion has caused your name to be falsely associated with our client’s registered mark, SCIENTOLOGY..The fact that you have changed one letter..does not protect you from trademark infringement.\"  Helena Kobrin, a lawyer for the Church of Scientology, was quoted as saying:  \"You can\\'t use somebody\\'s trademark, regardless of what you\\'re saying, if you haven\\'t been given permission.\"The site responded with a statement: \"The site is purely satirical and is for entertainment. It contains no fact nor claims to do so. The site clearly states in its header, \\'This site has absolutely no connection whatsoever with the Church of Scientology, it\\'s affiliated organisations or, needless to say, Tom Cruise\\'.\"  Stollery originally relented and agreed to change the domain name to \"passionofcruise.info\" on October 13, 2005, which E! News took to be a parody of the film The Passion of the Christ.After consulting with his lawyers in October 2005, Stollery responded to the Church with a far more aggressive stance. Now believing the accusation to be completely frivolous, Stollery publicly refused, challenging the Church with: \"I\\'m keeping my domain, see you in court.\" Again in an interview with ONE News, Stollery reiterated that he was going to retain rights to \"ScienTOMogy\", and not transfer the URL to the Church of Scientology, as they had requested. After the media attention, Stollery said he began to receive \"annoying calls\" from local Scientologists. \"The first few I was stupid enough to answer, but now they just call and call and call. When I did speak to \\'a church member here in Auckland\\' he kept insisting over and over that we meet to talk about my \\'vendetta\\' with the church.\"\\n\\nAftermath\\nThe threats gave the Web site a cult following of its own, taking its normal traffic from one hundred hits per day to one million in a matter of hours.  The Wall Street Journal carried reports commenting on the irony of the situation, noting the site\\'s message that the press exposure due to the threats from the Church of Scientology had increased its traffic over tenfold. Mel Gibson has not raised objections to use of the parody term \"PassionofCruise\". E! News reported that though Stollery had originally agreed to take down the site, it was still running and accessible as of July 2006, when the United Nations\\' World Intellectual Property Organization awarded Cruise rights to the domain name \"TomCruise.com\" over claims of a cybersquatter.In addition to hosting the original cease and desist letter, the Berkman Center for Internet & Society also gives legal commentary on various issues pertaining to the \"ScienTOMogy\" controversy at a page provided by the organization Chilling Effects.  They discuss \"trademark tarnishment\", which may occur if a non-owner of a trademark uses the work in an \"activity that is likely to offend the average person.\" However, the page also notes that the tarnishment would be non-actionable if the usage was non-commercial or parody. The Church of Scientology has not since filed a lawsuit or opened litigation on \"Scientomogy,\" and the site scientomogy.info no longer exists except in archives.\\n\\nSee also\\nScientology and the Internet\\nScientology controversy\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nScienTOMogy.info (via archive.org)\\nScientology objects to \"ScienTOMogy\", Original cease and desist letter from the Church of Scientology hosted at Chilling Effects, with legal commentary from the Berkman Center for Internet & Society',\n",
              " 'Shattered Glass (film)': 'Shattered Glass is a 2003 biographical drama film about journalist Stephen Glass and his scandal at The New Republic. Written and directed by Billy Ray, the film is based on a 1998 Vanity Fair article of the same name by H. G. Bissinger and chronicles Glass\\' fall from grace when his stories were discovered to be fabricated. It stars Hayden Christensen as Glass, alongside Peter Sarsgaard, Chloë Sevigny, and Steve Zahn.The film premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival on August 10, 2003, and received a North American limited release on November 26, 2003. Although a commercial failure, Shattered Glass received acclaim from critics, with particular praise for Christensen\\'s and Sarsgaard\\'s performances.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 1998, Stephen Glass is an associate editor at The New Republic. Among the youngest of the magazine\\'s staff, Glass enjoys popularity with his colleagues for his entertaining stories. Glass serves under editor Michael Kelly, whom the writers hold loyalty towards. However, conflict between Kelly and publisher Marty Peretz results in Peretz firing Kelly. Reporter Charles Lane is promoted by Peretz to replace Kelly despite being disliked by the staff.\\nGlass writes a story entitled \"Hack Heaven\" that details a teenage hacker being hired by a large software firm he infiltrated. The story reaches Forbes Digital Tool where reporter Adam Penenberg finds no corroborating evidence for what Glass described. When contacted by Penenberg about being unable to reach the individuals in his story, Glass provides a number with a Palo Alto area code for the firm. After Lane calls the number, he briefly speaks with an individual identifying as the firm\\'s chairman. Glass and Lane also partake in a conference call with the Forbes staff which further erodes the story\\'s credibility and prompts Glass to claim he was tricked by his sources.\\nLane, looking to protect Glass from the Forbes staff, has Glass take him to a convention center and restaurant where the story took place, but learns that both were closed during the events Glass wrote about. With the story contradicted by this information, Glass tells Lane he had only relied on sources for information and falsified his first-hand experiences to improve the story. Lane decides to suspend Glass instead of firing him due to his popularity, but upon discovering that Glass\\' brother lives in Palo Alto, he realizes that Glass had his brother pose as the firm\\'s chairman. After confronting Glass with this knowledge, Lane re-reads Glass\\' previous stories and comes to the revelation that they were also falsified. With his deception exposed, Glass is fired by Lane.\\nDespite initial pushback, Lane receives support from The New Republic staff for bringing Glass\\' deception to light, while the magazine\\'s attorney questions Glass over which stories of his were fabricated. Closing titles reveal that Penenberg\\'s article on Glass was hailed as a breakthrough for internet journalism, The New Republic determined that 27 of Glass\\' 41 stories were either partially or completely fabricated, Kelly was killed while covering the Iraq War, Glass earned a Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown and wrote a novel paralleling his own life, and Lane joined The Washington Post.\\n\\nCast\\nAdditionally, Louis Philippe Dandenault, Morgan Kelly, Christian Tessier, James Berlingieri, and Brett Watson appear as the Young Republicans described in one of Glass\\' stories. In Glass\\' depiction of \"Hack Heaven\", Owen Roth plays Ian Restil, Bill Rowat plays George Sims, Michele Scarabelli plays Ian\\'s mother, and Terry Simpson plays Joe Hiert. Alec Shumpert, a fictional associate editor at George, is played by Andrew Airlie. Mark Camacho appears as Glass\\' attorney and Lynne Adams appears as a companion of Kelly. Caroline Goodall portrays Highland Park High School teacher Mrs. Duke in the classroom sequences imagined by Glass. Making uncredited appearances are Sean Cullen as The New Republic\\'s attorney and the film\\'s editor Jeffrey Ford as the voice of a security guard at the magazine\\'s office.\\n\\nProduction\\nProducer Craig Baumgarten, working with HBO executive Gaye Hirsch, optioned H.G. Bissinger\\'s Vanity Fair magazine article about Stephen Glass for an HBO original movie. They hired screenwriter Billy Ray based on the script he had written for the TNT film Legalese. Ray grew up with Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as his heroes and studied journalism for a year. It was this love for journalism that motivated him to make Shattered Glass.A sudden change in management put the film into turnaround and it remained inactive for two years until Cruise/Wagner Productions bought it from HBO. They took it to Lionsgate and Ray asked the studio if he could direct in addition to writing it. The challenge for Ray was to make the subject matter watchable because, according to the filmmaker, \"watching people write is deadly dull ... in a film like this, dialogue is what a character is willing to reveal about himself, and the camera is there to capture everything else\". The breakthrough for Ray came when he realized that the film\\'s real protagonist was not Glass but Chuck Lane. According to Ray, \"as fascinating as Stephen Glass is by the end of the movie people would want to kill themselves – you just can\\'t follow him all the way\". He used the Bissinger article as a starting point, which gave him a line of dialogue on which to hook the entire character of Glass: \"Are you mad at me?\" According to Ray, \"you can build an entire character around that notion, and we did\".The character of Caitlin Avey is an amalgamation of Glass\\' friends and The New Republic allies Hanna Rosin and Jonathan Chait.To prepare for the film, Ray interviewed and re-interviewed key figures for any relevant details. He signed some of them as paid consultants and gave several approval over the script. Early on, he spent a considerable amount of time trying to earn the trust of the people who had worked with Glass and get them to understand that he was going to be objective with the subject matter. The real Michael Kelly was so unhappy about how he was portrayed in Bissinger\\'s article that he threatened to sue when Ray first contacted him about the film and refused for two years to read Ray\\'s script, which he eventually approved. Ray attempted to contact Glass through his lawyers but was unsuccessful. Lionsgate lawyers asked Ray to give them an annotated script where he had to footnote every line of dialogue and every assertion and back them up with corresponding notes.The night before principal photography began in Montreal, Ray screened All the President\\'s Men for the cast and crew. He shot both halves of the film differently – in the first half, he used hand-held cameras in the scenes that took place in the offices of The New Republic, but when the Forbes editors begin to question Glass, the camerawork was more stable.Ray\\'s original cut of the film was a much more straightforward account of events but while editing the film he realized that it was not good enough. He raised additional funds to shoot the high school scenes that bookend the film.On April 3, 2003, a little more than six months before the film was released, Michael Kelly was killed while reporting on the invasion of Iraq. The film is dedicated to his memory.\\n\\nRelease\\nShattered Glass premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the Telluride Film Festival, the Boston Film Festival, the Woodstock Film Festival, the Mill Valley Film Festival, and the Austin Film Festival before opening on eight screens in New York City and Los Angeles on October 31, 2003. It grossed $77,540 on its opening weekend. It eventually earned $2,220,008 in North America and $724,744 in other  markets for a total worldwide box office of $2,944,752.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 91% \"Certified Fresh\" rating, based on 172 reviews, with an average rating of 7.68/10. The site\\'s consensus states: \"A compelling look at Stephen Glass\\' fall from grace.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".A. O. Scott of The New York Times described the film as \"a serious, well-observed examination of the practice of journalism,\" and \"an astute and surprisingly gripping drama.\" He added, \"A more showily ambitious film might have tried to delve into Glass\\'s personal history in search of an explanation for his behavior, or to draw provocative connections between that behavior and the cultural and political climate of the times. Such a movie would also have been conventional, facile and ultimately false. Mr. Ray knows better than to sensationalize a story about the dangers of sensationalism. Shattered Glass is good enough to be true\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and felt the film was well-cast and \"deserves comparison with All the President\\'s Men among movies about journalism\". In a dissenting review from The Village Voice, J. Hoberman dismissed the film as \"self-important yet insipid,\" and asks, \"Shattered Glass begs a larger question: What sort of culture elevates Glass for his entertainment value, punishes him for being too entertaining, rewards his notoriety, and then resurrects him again as a moral object lesson?\"Sarsgaard\\'s performance as Charles Lane was singled out by several critics for praise.  USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote of him: \"Sarsgaard deserves more credit than he\\'ll probably get for his multi-layered performance\". Premiere\\'s Glenn Kenny wrote, \"it\\'s Peter Sarsgaard, as the editor who serves Glass his just desserts [sic], who walks away with the picture, metamorphosing his character\\'s stiffness into a moral indignation that\\'s jolting and, finally, invigorating\". His performance ended up winning numerous awards, including \"Best Supporting Actor\" citations from the Boston Society of Film Critics, Kansas City Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics, Online Film Critics Society, San Francisco Film Critics Circle, and the Toronto Film Critics Association, as well as nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards and the Golden Globes. The A.V. Club placed his portrayal of Chuck Lane at number six on a list of the best performances of the decade.Stephen Glass saw the film and, when reflecting about the experience, he said, \"It was very painful for me. It was like being on a guided tour of the moments of my life I am most ashamed of\".\\n\\nAwards and nominations\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nShattered Glass at IMDb\\nShattered Glass at Box Office Mojo\\nShattered Glass at Rotten Tomatoes\\nShattered Glass at Metacritic\\nShattered Glass on MUBI',\n",

              " 'Suspect Zero': 'Suspect Zero is a 2004 American psychological thriller film directed by E. Elias Merhige and starring Aaron Eckhart, Ben Kingsley, and Carrie-Anne Moss. The film was produced by Tom Cruise\\'s co-owned company Cruise/Wagner Productions. It was a box office bomb failing to earn half of its estimated $27 million production costs at the box office.\\nThe film is about the hunt for Suspect Zero, a potential serial killer who is able to kill indefinitely because he is able to remain undetectable by law enforcement agencies. It features various elements from declassified CIA Stargate remote viewing protocols.\\n\\nPlot\\nTraveling salesman Harold Speck is approached by a man in a diner who asks him an uncomfortable question. After leaving the diner, Harold is found dead with his eyelids cut off and clutching a symbol consisting of a circle with a line through it. The murder is investigated by FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart), who was recently suspended for beating suspected serial killer Raymond Starkey. Mackelway receives a series of taunting faxes from someone who may be Speck\\'s killer. As the investigation proceeds, Mackelway and his partner, Fran Kulok (Carrie-Anne Moss), become aware of the possible existence of Suspect Zero, a \"super serial killer\" responsible for hundreds of deaths who leaves no evidence behind to link his crimes together.\\nAnother body is found in the trunk of a car bearing an M.O. similar to Speck\\'s murder. The ownership of the car is traced to a room in a halfway house occupied by Benjamin O\\'Ryan. The agents discover that the room is filled with obsessive-compulsive sketches of the crossed-circle symbol, a Bible which contains sketches of missing persons, and a book on ritual. Questioning the other occupants of the halfway house, Mackelway is told by one of them the symbol represents a zero, not a circle. Information sent by the killer leads Mackelway to O\\'Ryan (Ben Kingsley), who believes himself to be a former member of the FBI. The agents must decide if O\\'Ryan is the key to catching Suspect Zero, or if he is Suspect Zero himself.\\nOutside a bar, O\\'Ryan kills a man who attempts to kidnap and rape a young girl. When Mackelway and Kulok arrive, they find that the body belongs to Starkey, who had been released from prison. Evidence reveals that O\\'Ryan was part of Project Icarus, a secret government project attempting to cultivate telepathic abilities in individuals for military purposes. The experiments gave O\\'Ryan the ability to see the actions of serial killers, driving him to hunt them down. O\\'Ryan demonstrates that Mackelway shares his abilities to some degree. Neither Kulok or Mackelway\\'s superiors are convinced by his theories that O\\'Ryan is chasing the killer rather than being the killer.\\nSuspect Zero is revealed to be a man who drives cross-country in a refrigerated truck. He targets children, whom he abducts and transports to his ranch, where he kills them. Mackelway links these crimes by recognizing that victims had signs of freezer burns while being transported. Mackelway chases one truck driver to a carnival, only to find that the child he saw in his vision as \"captured\" is free. O\\'Ryan suddenly appears and captures Mackelway. After refusing to be frightened, O\\'Ryan spares Mackelway. Eventually, the two men track Suspect Zero to his ranch and find numerous shallow graves. Chasing him, both vehicles crash off the road. Kulok manages to free a child while Mackelway kills Suspect Zero. O\\'Ryan then tries to convince Mackelway to end his suffering by killing him. When Mackelway refuses, O\\'Ryan pretends to attack him, prompting Kulok to shoot him to defend her partner.\\n\\nCast\\nAaron Eckhart – Thomas Mackelway\\nBen Kingsley – Benjamin O\\'Ryan\\nCarrie-Anne Moss – Fran Kulok\\nKevin Chamberlin – Harold Speck\\nHarry J. Lennix – Rich Charleton\\n\\nProduction\\nScreenplay\\nThe film is based on a first draft by Zak Penn, which allegedly impressed Steven Spielberg so much in its depiction of serial killers\\' elongated middle fingers that he went home and checked his children\\'s hands. After it was sold to Universal Studios for $750,000, Cruise/Wagner Productions (founded by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner) became its producers. However the script was put onto the back burner after a deal to make the movie in 1997 with Sylvester Stallone fell through.After several more years, Cruise/Wagner Productions hired Bill Ray to rewrite Penn\\'s original script. Changes included moving the action from Texas, making the lead character a burned-out, disgraced FBI agent rather than a rookie, and turning a maverick criminal profiler into a psychic with the power of remote viewing.\\n\\nFilming\\nThe film began shooting in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 2002. The State was chosen because it offered tax-free incentives and financial funding to film companies using New Mexico. The program was established to entice film makers to the State.\\n\\nReception\\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Suspect Zero holds an approval rating of 18% with a rating average of 4.4/10 based on 129 reviews. Its consensus reads, \"Other than Ben Kingsley, there\\'s not much to like in this preposterous thriller.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \"Generally unfavorable reviews\".Roger Ebert felt that the film was too confusing, stating \"enigmatic flashes of incomprehensible action grow annoying, and a point at which we realize that there\\'s no use paying close attention, because we won\\'t be able to figure out the film\\'s secrets until they\\'re explained to us.\" Nick Schager from Slant Magazine wrote a particularly scathing review of the film, stating \"Suspect Zero proves, uninspired imitation is the lowest form of thriller filmmaking.\" Carla Meyer from the San Francisco Chronicle was also critical of the film, writing, \"Suspect Zero needed to be exceptional, and it isn\\'t. It\\'s merely adequate, with one riveting element but limited chills.\"\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nSuspect Zero at IMDb\\nSuspect Zero at AllMovie\\nSuspect Zero at Rotten Tomatoes\\nSuspect Zero at Box Office Mojo\\nCast/Crew listing by the New York Times\\nNew York Times Review by Manohla Dargis\\n\"Anatomy of a Murder: the Unmaking of Suspect Zero, or How to Kill a Movie in a Hollywood Minute\" back-story commentary',\n",

It is a remake of the Pang Brothers\\' 2002 film of the same name.\\n\\nPlot\\nSydney Wells is a successful classical violinist from Los Angeles who has been blind since she was five years old, caused by an accident with firecrackers. Fifteen years later, after celebrating conductor and pianist Simon McCullough\\'s birthday during rehearsal, Sydney undergoes a cornea transplant, which causes her eyesight to return, a bit blurry at first. As time goes on, Sydney\\'s vision begins to clear; however, she also begins experiencing terrifying visions, mostly of fire and of people dying. She also sees people that are already dead, on one occasion when a girl passes right through her. Sydney attempts to unravel the mystery of the visions, and also to convince others, primarily her visual therapist and fellow violinist, Paul Faulkner, who helps her in her quest. She knows that she is not going insane.\\nAccompanied by Paul, Sydney travels to Mexico, where the cornea donor Ana Cristina Martinez was originally from. She discovers from Ana\\'s mother that the images of fire and death are the result of an industrial accident that Ana foretold. Ana hanged herself because she was unable to stop the accident. Sydney forgives Ana\\'s spirit, who leaves in peace. As Sydney and Paul begin their journey home, they are caught in a traffic congestion caused by a police chase on the other side of the border. Sydney sees the little girl from her vision in the car next to her. She then realizes that this is what her vision has been all along, to save the people that are about to die from an accident.\\nStill able to see the death silhouettes, Sydney begins to get everyone off the highway, starting with a bus filled with people. She and Paul convince everyone to leave the bus and the cars by telling them that there is a bomb inside the bus. However, a driver leading the police chase rushes through the border barriers and collides into a tank truck, igniting leaking gasoline in the process. Sydney sees the little girl trapped in the car, her mother laying on the ground in front of it, already being hit by a passenger and losing consciousness. Paul breaks open the window and gets the girl out. Paul and Sydney carry the girl and her mother to safety just before the tank truck causes a chain explosion. Sydney is blinded by flying glass fragments in the process.\\nAfter recovering at a hospital, she returns to Los Angeles to continue performing as a blind violinist, though with a more optimistic view of her condition.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nRemake rights to the Pang brothers\\' original 2002 Hong Kong film, The Eye, were purchased by Cruise/Wagner Productions.\\nThe band Blaqk Audio provided instrumental versions of the songs, \"Between Breaths\" and \"The Love Letter\" that were used in trailers and on the official website for the 2008 film.

Exteriors were shot to look like the Downtown Los Angeles area. The establishing hospital shots – wherein Sydney is supposed to have had her sight-restoring surgery – are of LAC/USC Medical Center in the Boyle Heights district; 3/4 shots looking north- and southeast of the main 18-floor-high central building (the same building used for the television soap-opera General Hospital). Fictionally, the burned-out Chinese restaurant is supposed to be located just three-blocks from where Sydney lives; the exterior scene, in which Sydney is about to get into a taxicab and travel to Mexico, was filmed on 7th Street, just east of Figueroa, in the downtown area. Shots of Dr. Faulkner\\'s office building are of the Forestry building at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Several other scenes, including outdoor shots, were shot in Albuquerque.\\n\\nReception\\nCritical reception\\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics, many considering it inferior to the original. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 22% based on 78 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10.

              " 'The Last Samurai': 'The Last Samurai is a 2003 American period action drama film directed and co-produced by Edward Zwick, who also co-wrote the screenplay with John Logan and Marshall Herskovitz. The film stars Tom Cruise, who also co-produced, with Timothy Spall, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada, Koyuki, and Shin Koyamada in supporting roles.\\nTom Cruise portrays a United States Captain of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, whose personal and emotional conflicts bring him into contact with samurai warriors in the wake of the Meiji Restoration in 19th century Japan. The film\\'s plot was inspired by the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion led by Saigō Takamori, and the westernization of Japan by foreign powers, though in the film the United States is portrayed as the primary force behind the push for westernization. It is also influenced by the stories of Jules Brunet, a French army captain who fought alongside Enomoto Takeaki in the earlier Boshin War and to a lesser extent by Frederick Townsend Ward, an American mercenary who helped Westernize the Chinese army by forming the Ever Victorious Army.\\nThe Last Samurai grossed a total of $456 million at the box office and was well-received upon its release, receiving praise for the acting, writing, directing, score, visuals, costumes, but criticized in Japan for a romanticized \"storybook\" portrayal of the samurai, who are regarded as more corrupt. It was nominated for several awards, including four Academy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and two National Board of Review Awards.\\n\\nPlot\\nFormer Army Captain Nathan Algren, a bitter alcoholic traumatized by the atrocities he committed during the American Indian Wars, is approached by his former commanding officer, Colonel Bagley, to train the newly created Imperial Japanese Army for Omura, a wealthy Japanese businessman and political figure who intends to use the army to suppress a rebellion of discontented samurai against Japan\\'s new emperor. Despite his hatred of Bagley, an impoverished Algren takes the job for the money, and is accompanied to Japan by his old friend, Sergeant Zebulon Gant. Upon arriving, Algren meets Simon Graham, a British translator and photographer with extensive knowledge of the samurai.\\nAlgren finds the Imperial soldiers are actually conscripted peasants that have no battlefield experience or proper training. Before he can train his men, Algren is informed that the samurai are attacking one of Omura\\'s railroads; Omura sends the army after them, despite Algren\\'s protests that they are not ready. The battle is a disaster, with the undisciplined conscripts fleeing in terror and Gant getting killed. Algren fights to the last before he is surrounded; expecting to die, he is taken prisoner when the enemy commander, Katsumoto, decides to spare him. Algren is taken to Katsumoto\\'s village to live with his family. While he is treated poorly at first, he eventually befriends Katsumoto and earns the respect of his samurai. Algren overcomes his alcoholism and guilt, learns Japanese, and becomes proficient in the samurai style of fighting. He develops sympathy for Katsumoto\\'s cause, recognizing that they are genuinely upset with how Western technology and customs have eroded the traditions of their society and their influence and power. Algren and Taka, Katsumoto\\'s sister and the widow of a samurai killed by Algren, develop an unspoken affection for each other.\\nOne night, a group of assassins infiltrate the village and attempt to kill Katsumoto. Algren saves Katsumoto\\'s life, and then helps defend the village. Katsumoto requests a meeting with Emperor Meiji and is given safe passage to Tokyo. He brings Algren, intending to release him. Upon arriving in Tokyo, Algren finds the Imperial Army is now a well-trained and fully equipped fighting force under Bagley. Katsumoto, to his dismay, discovers that the young and inexperienced Emperor has essentially become a puppet of Omura. At a government meeting, Omura orders Katsumoto\\'s arrest for carrying a sword in public and asks him to perform seppuku to redeem his honor. Algren refuses Omura\\'s offer to betray Katsumoto and kills several armed men who try to ambush him. Algren and Graham assist the samurai in freeing Katsumoto; in the process, Katsumoto\\'s son Nobutada is mortally wounded and sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape.\\nAs the Imperial Army marches to crush the rebellion, a grieving Katsumoto contemplates suicide, but Algren convinces him to fight until the end, and joins the samurai in battle. The samurai use the Imperial Army\\'s overconfidence to lure them into a trap, cutting them off from their artillery and showering them with arrows. The ensuing battle inflicts massive casualties on both sides and forces the Imperial soldiers to retreat. Knowing that Imperial reinforcements are coming and defeat is inevitable, Katsumoto orders his remaining men to join him in a suicidal cavalry charge. During the charge, the samurai break through Bagley\\'s line. Bagley is killed by Algren, but the samurai are quickly mowed down by gatling guns. The Imperial captain, previously trained by Algren and horrified by the sight of the dying samurai, orders all of the guns to cease firing, disregarding Omura\\'s orders. A mortally wounded Katsumoto commits seppuku with Algren\\'s help as the soldiers at the scene kneel in respect.\\nDays later, as trade negotiations conclude, an injured Algren arrives in his old Army uniform and interrupts the proceedings. He presents the Emperor with Katsumoto\\'s sword and asks him to remember the traditions for which Katsumoto and his fellow samurai died. The Emperor realizes that while Japan should modernize, it cannot forget its own culture and history; he promptly refuses to sign the trade treaty. When Omura protests, the Emperor silences him by threatening to seize his family\\'s assets and distribute them among the populace.\\nAlgren subsequently disappears. While various rumors regarding his fate circulate, Graham concludes that Algren has finally found peace as he is seen returning to the village and reuniting with Taka.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War and Indian War veteran haunted by his role in the massacre of Native Americans at the Washita River. Following a dismissal from his job, he agrees to help the new Meiji Restoration government train its first Western-style conscript army for a significant sum of money. During the army\\'s first battle he is captured by the samurai Katsumoto and taken to the village of Katsumoto\\'s son, where he soon becomes intrigued with the way of the samurai and decides to join them in their cause. His journal entries reveal his impressions about traditional Japanese culture, which almost immediately evolve into unrestrained admiration.\\nKen Watanabe as Lord Moritsgu Katsumoto, a former daimyo who was once Emperor Meiji\\'s most trusted teacher. His displeasure with the influence of Omura and other Western reformers on the Emperor lead him to organize his fellow samurai in a revolt, which he hopes will convince the government not to destroy the samurai\\'s place in Japanese society. Katsumoto is based on real-life samurai Saigō Takamori, who led the Satsuma Rebellion.\\nKoyuki Kato as Taka, wife of a samurai slain by Nathan Algren and younger sister of Lord Katsumoto. She and Algren develop feelings for each other, and she gives him her husband\\'s armor to wear in the final battle of the rebellion.\\nShin Koyamada as Nobutada Katsumoto, Katsumoto\\'s son who is responsible for the village where Algren is sent. Nobutada befriends Algren when Katsumoto assigns him to teach Algren Japanese culture and the Japanese language. He dies when he willingly chooses to distract Imperial troops so his father can escape their custody.\\nTony Goldwyn as Colonel Bagley, Nathan Algren\\'s former commanding officer in the 7th Cavalry Regiment, who hires him to serve as a training instructor for the Imperial Army despite Algren\\'s hatred of Bagley for his role in the Washita River massacre. In contrast to Algren, Bagley is arrogant and dismissive of the samurai, at one point referring to them nothing more than \"savages with bows and arrows\". He is killed by Algren who throws a sword into his chest when Bagley tries to shoot Katsumoto in the final battle.\\nMasato Harada as Matsue Omura, an industrialist and pro-reform politician. He quickly imports westernization and modernization while making money for himself through his ownership of Japan\\'s railroads. Coming from a merchant family, a social class repressed during the days of Shogun rule, Omura openly expresses his contempt for the samurai and takes advantage of Emperor Meiji\\'s youth to become his chief advisor, persuading him to form a Western-style army for the sole purpose of wiping out Katsumoto and his rebels while ignoring their grievances. His appearance is designed to evoke the image of Okubo Toshimichi, a leading reformer during the Meiji Restoration. Harada noted that he was deeply interested in joining the film after witnessing the construction of Emperor Meiji\\'s conference room on sound stage 19 (where Humphrey Bogart had once acted) at Warner Brothers studios.\\nShichinosuke Nakamura as Emperor Meiji. Credited with the implementation of the Meiji reforms to Japanese society, the Emperor is eager to import Western ideas and practices to modernize and empower Japan to become a strong nation. However, his inexperience causes him to rely heavily on the advice of men like Omura, who have their own agendas. His appearance bears a strong resemblance to Emperor Meiji during the 1860s (when his authority as Emperor was not yet firmly established) rather than during the 1870s, when the film takes place.\\nHiroyuki Sanada as Ujio, a master swordsman and one of Katsumoto\\'s most trusted followers. He teaches Algren the art of sword fighting, coming to respect him as an equal. He is one of the last samurai to die in the final battle, being gunned down during Katsumoto\\'s charge.\\nTimothy Spall as Simon Graham, a British photographer and scholar hired as an interpreter for Captain Algren and his non-English speaking soldiers. Initially portrayed as a friendly yet mission-oriented and practical-minded companion, he later comes to sympathize with the samurai cause and helps Algren rescue Katsumoto from Imperial soldiers.\\nSeizo Fukumoto as Silent Samurai, an elderly samurai tasked with monitoring Algren during his time in the village, who calls the samurai \"Bob\". \"Bob\" ultimately saves Algren\\'s life (and speaking for the first and only time, \"Algren-san!\") by taking a bullet meant for him in the final battle.\\nBilly Connolly as Sergeant Zebulon Gant, an Irish-American Civil War veteran who served with and is loyal to Algren, persuading him to come to Japan and working with him to train the Imperial Army. During the first battle, he is killed by Hirotaro (Taka\\'s husband) after another samurai wounds him with a spear.\\nShun Sugata as Nakao, a tall samurai who wields a naginata and is skilled in jujutsu. He assists Algren in rescuing Katsumoto, and dies along with the other samurai in the final battle.\\n\\nProduction\\nFilming took place in New Zealand, mostly in the Taranaki region, with Japanese cast members and an American production crew. This location was chosen due to the fact that Egmont/Mount Taranaki resembles Mount Fuji, and also because there is a lot of forest and farmland in the Taranaki region. American Location Manager Charlie Harrington saw the mountain in a travel book and encouraged the producers to send him to Taranaki to scout the locations. This acted as a backdrop for many scenes, as opposed to the built up cities of Japan. Several of the village scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. Studios backlot in Burbank, California. Some scenes were shot in Kyoto and Himeji, Japan. There were 13 filming locations altogether. Tom Cruise did his own stunts for the film.\\nThe film is based on an original screenplay entitled \"The Last Samurai\", from a story by John Logan. The project itself was inspired by writer and director Vincent Ward. Ward became executive producer on the film – working in development on it for nearly four years and after approaching several directors (Francis Ford Coppola, Peter Weir), until he became interested with Edward Zwick. The film production went ahead with Zwick and was shot in Ward\\'s native New Zealand.\\nThe film was based on the stories of Jules Brunet, a French army captain who fought alongside Enomoto Takeaki in the earlier Boshin War and Frederick Townsend Ward, an American mercenary who helped westernize the Qing army by forming the Ever Victorious Army. The historical roles of other European nations who were involved in the westernization of Japan are largely attributed to the United States in the film, although the film references European involvement as well.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe Last Samurai: Original Motion Picture Score was released on November 25, 2003 by Warner Sunset Records. All music on the soundtrack was composed, arranged, and produced by Hans Zimmer, performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony, and conducted by Blake Neely. It peaked at number 24 on the US Top Soundtracks chart.\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nThe film achieved higher box office receipts in Japan than in the United States. Critical reception in Japan was generally positive. Tomomi Katsuta of The Mainichi Shinbun thought that the film was \"a vast improvement over previous American attempts to portray Japan\", noting that director Edward Zwick \"had researched Japanese history, cast well-known Japanese actors and consulted dialogue coaches to make sure he didn\\'t confuse the casual and formal categories of Japanese speech.\" Katsuta still found fault with the film\\'s idealistic, \"storybook\" portrayal of the samurai, stating: \"Our image of samurai is that they were more corrupt.\" As such, he said, the noble samurai leader Katsumoto \"set my teeth on edge.\"In the United States, critic Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"beautifully designed, intelligently written, acted with conviction, it\\'s an uncommonly thoughtful epic.\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 66% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 221 reviews, with an average score of 6.43/10. The site\\'s consensus states: \"With high production values and thrilling battle scenes, The Last Samurai is a satisfying epic\". At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 55, based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".One on-line analyst compares the movie favorably to Dances With Wolves in that each protagonist meets and combats a \"technologically backward people\".  Both Costner\\'s and Cruise\\'s characters have suffered through a series of traumatic and brutal battles.  Each ultimately uses his experiences to later assist his new friends.  Each comes to respect his newly adopted culture.  Each even fights with his new community against the people and traditions from which he came.  []\\n\\nBox office\\nAs of January 1, 2016, the film had grossed $456.8 million against a production budget of $140 million. It grossed $111,127,263 in the United States and Canada, and $345,631,718 in other territories. It was one of the most successful box office hits in Japan, where it grossed ¥13.7 billion ($132 million).\\n\\nAccolades\\nCriticism and debate\\nMotoko Rich of The New York Times observed that the film has opened up a debate, \"particularly among Asian-Americans and Japanese,\" about whether the film and others like it were \"racist, naïve, well-intentioned, accurate – or all of the above.\"Todd McCarthy, a film critic for the Variety magazine, wrote: \"Clearly enamored of the culture it examines while resolutely remaining an outsider\\'s romanticization of it, yarn is disappointingly content to recycle familiar attitudes about the nobility of ancient cultures, Western despoilment of them, liberal historical guilt, the unrestrainable greed of capitalists and the irreducible primacy of Hollywood movie stars.\"According to history professor Cathy Schultz, \"Many samurai fought Meiji modernization not for altruistic reasons but because it challenged their status as the privileged warrior caste. Meiji reformers proposed the radical idea that all men essentially being equal ... The film also misses the historical reality that many Meiji policy advisors were former samurai, who had voluntarily given up their traditional privileges to follow a course they believed would strengthen Japan.\"The fictional character of Katsumoto bears a striking resemblance to the historical figure of Saigō Takamori, a hero of the Meiji Restoration and the leader of the ineffective Satsuma Rebellion, who appears in the histories and legends of modern Japan as a hero against the corruption, extravagance, and unprincipled politics of his contemporaries. \"Though he had agreed to become a member of the new government,\" writes the translator and historian Ivan Morris, \"it was clear from his writings and statements that he believed the ideals of the civil war were being vitiated. He was opposed to the excessively rapid changes in Japanese society and was particularly disturbed by the shabby treatment of the warrior class.\" Suspicious of the new bureaucracy, he wanted power to remain in the hands of the samurai class and the Emperor, and it was for this purpose that he had joined the central government. \"Edicts like the interdiction against carrying swords and wearing the traditional topknot seemed like a series of gratuitous provocations; and, though Saigō realized that Japan needed an effective standing army to resist pressure from the West, he could not countenance the social implications of the military reforms. For this reason Saigō, although participating in the Okinoerabu government, continued to exercise a powerful appeal among disgruntled ex-samurai in Satsuma and elsewhere.\" Saigō fought for a moral revolution, not a material one, and he described his revolt as a check on the declining morality of a new, Westernizing materialism.In 2014, the movie was one of several discussed by Keli Goff in The Daily Beast in an article concerning white savior narratives in film, a cinematic trope studied in sociology, for which The Last Samurai has been analyzed. David Sirota at Salon saw the film as \"yet another film presenting the white Union army official as personally embodying the North\\'s Civil War effort to liberate people of color\" and criticizing the release poster as \"a not-so-subtle message encouraging audiences to (wrongly) perceive the white guy -- and not a Japanese person -- as the last great leader of the ancient Japanese culture.\"\\n\\nSee also\\nForeign government advisors in Meiji Japan\\nŌmura Masujirō\\nFrench Military Mission to Japan (1867)\\nMark Rappaport (creature effects artist)\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nPrimadhy Wicaksono (2007). \"THE INFLUENCE OF BUSHIDO ON NATHAN ALGREN\\'S PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AS SEEN IN JOHN LOGAN\\'S  MOVIE SCRIPT THE LAST SAMURAI\" (PDF).

              " 'The Others (2001 film)': 'The Others (Spanish: Los otros) is a 2001 English-language Spanish gothic supernatural psychological horror film. It was written, directed, and scored by Alejandro Amenábar. It stars Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Elaine Cassidy, Eric Sykes, Alakina Mann and James Bentley.\\nThe Others was theatrically released in the United States on August 2, 2001, by Dimension Films and in Spain on September 7, 2001, by Warner Sogefilms. The film was a box-office success, grossing over $209.9 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, with many praising Amenábar\\'s direction and screenplay, as well as the musical score, atmosphere and Kidman\\'s performance.\\nThe film won seven Goya Awards, including awards for Best Film and Best Director. This was the first English-language film ever to receive the Best Film Award at the Goyas (Spain\\'s national film awards), without a single word of Spanish spoken in it. The Others was nominated for six Saturn Awards including Best Director and Best Writing for Amenábar and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Alakina Mann, and won three: Best Horror Film, Best Actress for Kidman and Best Supporting Actress for Fionnula Flanagan. Kidman was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Drama and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, with Amenábar being nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, a rare occurrence for a horror film.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 1945, Grace Stewart awakens one day from a nightmare in the immediate aftermath of World War II. She lives in a remote country house in Jersey with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a rare disease characterized by photosensitivity (possibly  xeroderma pigmentosum). Grace hires three new servants— housekeeper Mrs. Bertha Mills, gardener Edmund Tuttle, and a mute girl named Lydia. Mrs. Mills explains to Grace that she worked in the same house many years before. When odd events occur at the house, Grace begins to fear there are unknown \"others\" present. Anne claims to have seen a group of people in the house several times: a man, a woman, an old woman and a child called Victor, who claimed that \"the house is theirs\". After Grace hears footsteps and unknown voices, she orders the house to be searched. She then finds a 19th-century photo album of mourning portrait photographs. When Grace asks Mrs. Mills about her previous experience in the house, Mrs. Mills recounts that many left due to an outbreak of tuberculosis.\\nAt night, Grace witnesses a piano playing itself and becomes convinced that the house is haunted. She runs outside in search of the local priest to bless the house. Before leaving, Grace instructs Tuttle to check a small nearby cemetery to see if a family has been buried there with a little boy named Victor. Tuttle finds the cemetery but covers the gravestones with leaves at the order of Mrs. Mills who assures him that Grace will learn the reasons behind the unexplained events in due time. Outside, Grace runs into her husband Charles, who she thought had been killed in the war. Charles greets his children after a long absence, but is distant during his short stay at the house. Later, Grace checks up on her daughter, Anne, whom she has left to play in a spare room.  Instead, to her horror Grace finds an old woman on the floor in the room wearing her daughter\\'s communion dress, veil down.  The old woman claims in Anne\\'s voice \"I am your daughter\".  Frightened, Grace attacks the old woman only to find that the old woman is merely an illusion and Grace has inadvertently attacked her own daughter. Later, Anne tells her brother that their mother has gone mad in the same way she did \"that day\" but he does not recall.  Charles says he must leave for the front, even though Grace claims that the war is over. The two embrace and lie motionless together in bed.\\nThe next morning, Charles has left and the children are screaming that the curtains are gone, thus letting in the sunlight. Grace accuses the servants of having removed the curtains against her wishes and expels them from the house. That night, the children sneak outside and discover that the headstones in the cemetery belong to the recently banished servants. The children run away in fear when they turn to see that the servants are approaching them toward the cemetery in the foggy dark of night. Meanwhile, Grace finds a photograph that has slipped out of the Book of the Dead and fallen onto the floor under some furniture. The photograph displays the corpses of the three servants, Mrs. Mills, Tuttle and Lydia, who perished during a tuberculosis outbreak in 1891. The children run upstairs and hide in the bedroom where they are discovered by \"the other\" elderly woman. Mrs. Mills returns to the house and tells Grace to go upstairs and talk to the intruders.\\nGrace discovers that the old woman is in fact a medium in a séance with Victor\\'s parents, who has found out via automatic writing that Grace smothered her children to death with a pillow in a fit of despair before committing suicide. Grace realizes that \"the others\" are the family that has moved into the house, and that she, her children, and the servants are, in fact, dead.\\nFollowing this display of supernatural and spiritual activity, Victor and his family vacate the house and leave it in the occupancy of the ghosts of its predecessors. However, because they are dead, Anne and Nicholas\\' ghosts are finally allowed to play in the sun. Mrs. Mills informs the Stewarts that others will come back to the house and they will have to learn to coexist together, but Grace ominously states that the house is theirs. As she says this, more \"For Sale\" signs are posted outside.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nThe production crew visited Penshurst Place in Kent to film at the Lime Walk in the gardens. The Lime Walk was used in the scene where Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) went looking for a priest in the thick fog and instead met her husband who had returned from the war. Filming locations are, among other spots, Palacio de los Hornillos in Las Fraguas, Cantabria, Northern Spain, and in Madrid.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nThe Others was released August 10, 2001 in 1,678 theaters in the United States and Canada and grossed $14 million its opening weekend, ranking fourth at the box office. It stayed in fourth for three more weeks, expanding to more theaters. During the weekend of September 21–23, it was second at the box office, grossing $5 million in 2,801 theaters. The film, which cost $17 million to produce, eventually grossed $96.5 million in the United States and Canada and $113.4 million in other countries, for a worldwide total gross of $209.9 million.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nMany critics praised the performances of the stars especially Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 83% approval rating based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"The Others is a spooky thriller that reminds us that a movie doesn\\'t need expensive special effects to be creepy\". On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 74 out of 100, based on 29 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, praising that \"...Alejandro Amenábar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric\". However, he noted that \"in drawing out his effects, Amenábar is a little too confident that style can substitute for substance\".Although the film deals primarily with the spiritual interaction of ghosts with each other rather than with living humans, William Skidelsky of The Observer has suggested that it was inspired by the 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw written by Henry James.\\n\\nAccolades\\nGoya Awards:\\nBest Cinematography (Javier Aguirresarobe)\\nBest Director (Alejandro Amenábar)\\nBest Editing (Nacho Ruiz Capillas)\\nBest Film\\nBest Production Design\\nBest Production Supervision\\nBest Original Screenplay (Alejandro Amenábar)\\nBest Sound\\nKansas City Film Critics Circle Awards:\\nBest Actress (Nicole Kidman)\\nLondon Film Critics:\\nBest Actress of the Year (Nicole Kidman)\\nOnline Film Critics:\\nBest Actress (Nicole Kidman)\\nBest Original Screenplay (Alejandro Amenábar)\\nSaturn Awards:\\nBest Actress (Nicole Kidman)\\nBest Supporting Actress (Fionnula Flanagan)\\nBest Horror Film\\n\\nPlanned remake\\nIn April 2020, Sentient Entertainment had acquired the remake rights to the film.

His films have grossed over $4 billion in North America and over $10.1 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing box office stars of all time.Cruise began acting in the early 1980s and made his breakthrough with leading roles in the comedy film Risky Business (1983) and action drama film Top Gun (1986). Critical acclaim came with his roles in the drama films The Color of Money (1986), Rain Man (1988), and Born on the Fourth of July (1989). For his portrayal of Ron Kovic in the latter, he won a Golden Globe Award and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. As a leading Hollywood star in the 1990s, he starred in several commercially successful films, including the drama A Few Good Men (1992), the thriller The Firm (1993), the horror film Interview with the Vampire (1994), and the romance Jerry Maguire (1996). For his role in the latter, he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and received his second Academy Award nomination.\\nCruise\\'s performance as a motivational speaker in the drama film Magnolia (1999) earned him another Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. As an action star, he has played Ethan Hunt in all six of the Mission: Impossible films from 1996 to 2018. He also starred in science fiction and action films, including Vanilla Sky (2001), Minority Report (2002), The Last Samurai (2003), Collateral (2004), War of the Worlds (2005), Knight and Day (2010), Jack Reacher (2012), Oblivion (2013), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and The Mummy (2017).\\nCruise has been married to actresses Mimi Rogers, Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes. He has three children, two of whom were adopted during his marriage to Kidman and the other of whom is a biological daughter he had with Holmes. Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs, which he credits with helping him overcome dyslexia. In the 2000s, he sparked controversy with his Church-affiliated criticisms of psychiatry and anti-depressant drugs, his efforts to promote Scientology as a religion in Europe, and a leaked video interview of him promoting Scientology.\\n\\nEarly life\\nThomas Cruise Mapother IV was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, to electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934–1984) and special education teacher Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer; 1936–2017). His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and had English, German, and Irish ancestry. Cruise has three sisters named Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. One of his cousins, William Mapother, is also an actor who has appeared alongside Cruise in five films. Cruise grew up in near poverty and had a Catholic upbringing. He later described his father as \"a merchant of chaos\", a \"bully\", and a \"coward\" who beat his children. He elaborated, \"[My father] was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he\\'d lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, \\'There\\'s something wrong with this guy. Don\\'t trust him. Be careful around him.\\'\"Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada. When his father took a job as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces, his family moved in late 1971 to Beacon Hill, Ottawa. He attended the new Robert Hopkins Public School for his fourth and fifth grade education. He first became involved in drama in fourth grade, under the tutelage of George Steinburg. He and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival. Drama organizer Val Wright, who was in the audience, later said that \"the movement and improvisation were excellent [...] it was a classic ensemble piece\". In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa. That year, his mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States. In 1978, she married Jack South. Cruise\\'s father died of cancer in 1984. Cruise briefly took a church scholarship and attended a Franciscan seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio; he aspired to become a priest before he became interested in acting. In total, he attended 15 schools in 14 years. In his senior year of high school, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game. He went on to star in the school\\'s production of Guys and Dolls. In 1980, he graduated from Glen Ridge High School in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.\\n\\nCareer\\nActing\\nAt age 18, with the blessing of his mother and stepfather, Cruise moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. After working as a busboy in New York, he went to Los Angeles to try out for television roles. He signed with CAA and began acting in films. He first appeared in a bit part in the 1981 film Endless Love, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in Taps later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of The Outsiders. That same year he appeared in All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as \"A Generation X classic, and a career maker for Tom Cruise\". He also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film Legend, released in 1985. By 1986\\'s Top Gun, his status as a superstar cemented.\\n\\nCruise followed up Top Gun with The Color of Money, which came out the same year, and which paired him with  Paul Newman. 1988 saw him star in Cocktail, which earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Film and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in 1989\\'s Born on the Fourth of July, which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People\\'s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise\\'s first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.\\nCruise\\'s next films were Days of Thunder (1990) and Far and Away (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest, followed by the legal thriller The Firm, which was a critical and commercial success. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan\\'s Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice\\'s best-selling novel. The film was well-received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film, however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in Daily Variety praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of Mission: Impossible, which he produced. It was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the Jim Phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series.In 1996, he took on the title role in Jerry Maguire, for which he earned a Golden Globe and his second nomination for an Academy Award. In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in the erotic Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut, and took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in Magnolia, for which he received another Golden Globe and nomination for an Academy Award.\\nIn 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the Mission Impossible films, Mission: Impossible 2. The film was helmed by Hong Kong director John Woo and branded with his gun fu style, and continued the series\\' blockbuster success at the box office, taking in almost $547M in worldwide figures. Like its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year, and had a mixed critical reception. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for this film.\\nHis next five films were major critical and commercial successes. The following year Cruise starred in the romantic thriller Vanilla Sky (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction action film Minority Report which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the science fiction short story by Philip K. Dick.\\n\\nIn 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick\\'s period action drama The Last Samurai, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor. In 2004, Cruise received critical acclaim for his performance as Vincent in Collateral, directed by Michael Mann. In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4 million worldwide. Also in 2005, he won the People\\'s Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star and the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100 million at the box office.In 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the Mission Impossible film series, Mission: Impossible III. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed nearly $400 million at the box office. In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in Lions for Lambs, which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as \"Les Grossman\" in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr.  This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller Valkyrie released on December 25, 2008 to box office success.In March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy Knight and Day, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010. On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. The film was released in December 2011 to high critical acclaim and box office success. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise\\'s biggest commercial success to that date.\\n\\nOn May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist. In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie Rock of Ages, in which he played the character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012.Cruise starred as Jack Reacher in the film adaptation of British author Lee Child\\'s 2005 novel One Shot. The film was released on December 21, 2012. It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $217 million worldwide. In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film Oblivion based on director Joseph Kosinski\\'s  graphic novel of the same name. The film met with mixed reviews and grossed $286 million worldwide. It also starred Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko. In 2014, Cruise starred in the science fiction-action film Edge of Tomorrow, which received positive reviews and grossed over $370 million.In 2015, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the Mission: Impossible series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which he also produced. Returning cast members included Simon Pegg as Benji and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, with Christopher McQuarrie as director. The film earned high critical acclaim and was a commercial success.Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff\\'s 1932 horror movie The Mummy. The new film, also titled The Mummy received negative reviews and flopped at the box office. In 2018, Cruise again reprised Ethan Hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, Mission: Impossible – Fallout. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed over $791 million at the box office. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it is Cruise\\'s biggest commercial success to date.\\n\\nProducing\\nCruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993, and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise\\'s films, the first being Mission: Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise\\'s first project as a producer.\\n\\nCruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as \"one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood.\" Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise\\'s tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise\\'s exceptional commercial prowess.Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise\\'s film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on Erik Larson\\'s New York Times bestseller The Devil in the White City about a real-life serial killer, H. H. Holmes, at Chicago\\'s World\\'s Columbian Exposition. Kathryn Bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the World\\'s Fair, in which DiCaprio will star.Cruise has produced several films in which he appeared. He produced Mission: Impossible, Without Limits, Mission: Impossible 2, The Others, Vanilla Sky and many others.\\n\\nBreak with Paramount\\nOn August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In the Wall Street Journal, chairman of Viacom (Paramount\\'s parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise\\'s value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views. Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount\\'s announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms.Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount\\'s discontent over Cruise/Wagner\\'s exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the Mission: Impossible franchise.\\n\\nManagement of United Artists\\nIn November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists. Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA\\'s chief executive.\\nProduction began in 2007 of Valkyrie, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007, Cruise signed to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. Lambs was released on November 9, 2007, opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.\\nIn August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise\\'s share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nRelationships and wealth\\nCruise splits his time between homes in Beverly Hills, California; Telluride, Colorado; Clearwater, Florida; Dulwich, London; and East Grinstead, West Sussex. He had several relationships with women in the early-to-mid-1980s, including Rebecca De Mornay, Patti Scialfa, and Cher.Cruise married actress Mimi Rogers on May 9, 1987. They divorced on February 4, 1990. Rogers introduced Cruise to Scientology.Cruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. They adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. In 2007, Kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to Cruise, saying that it was wrongly reported and explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy.Cruise was next romantically linked with Penélope Cruz, his co-star in Vanilla Sky (2001). Their relationship ended in 2004. An article in the October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair stated that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, Scientologist leaders launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of \"auditions\" of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology. Scientology and Cruise\\'s lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing Vanity Fair of \"shoddy journalism\" and \"religious bigotry\". Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.In April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On April 27 that year, Cruise and Holmes—dubbed TomKat by the media—made their first public appearance together in Rome. A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show, infamously jumping up and down on Winfrey\\'s couch during the show. Media coverage at the time implied that Oprah was somewhat taken aback by Cruise\\'s overexhuberent couch-outburst, which distracted from the intended promotion of Cruise\\'s current film, War of the Worlds. On October 6, 2005, Cruise and Holmes announced they were expecting a child. In April 2006, their daughter Suri was born. On November 18, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, in a Scientologist ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars. Their publicists said the couple had \"officialized\" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony. There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the Church of Scientology. David Miscavige, the head of Scientology, served as Cruise\\'s best man. On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise. On July 9, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers. New York law requires all divorce documents remain sealed, so the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available.\\n\\nSpaceflight mission\\nCruise is sponsored for an upcoming spaceflight mission on the SpaceX AX-1 mission in late 2021, as part of a project to film an upcoming unnamed movie in space on board the International Space Station.\\n\\nScientology\\nCruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs. He became involved with Scientology in 1990 through his first wife, Mimi Rogers. Cruise struggled with dyslexia at an early age and has said that Scientology, specifically the L. Ron Hubbard Study Tech, helped him overcome dyslexia.\\n\\nAdvocacy of Scientology\\nIn addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Paris city council revealed that Cruise had lobbied officials Nicolas Sarkozy and Jean-Claude Gaudin. They described him as a militant spokesman for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him.Cruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City 9/11 rescue workers detoxification therapy based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This drew criticism from the medical profession and from firefighters.For such activities, Scientology leader David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004.\\n\\nCriticism of psychiatry\\nIn January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement \"I think psychiatry should be outlawed.\" Further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an antidepressant to which Shields credits her recovery from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. In response, Shields argued that Cruise \"should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them\". This led to a heated argument between Matt Lauer and Cruise on NBC\\'s Today on June 24, 2005.Medical authorities view Cruise\\'s comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness. Shields herself called Cruise\\'s comments \"a disservice to mothers everywhere.\" In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the psychoactive drugs which are routinely prescribed for treatment.  It was reported that Cruise\\'s anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise\\'s presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor\\'s office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.\\n\\nYouTube video removal\\nOn January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him. The Church of Scientology said the video had been \"pirated and edited,\" and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology. YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.After YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the fair use clause. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of June 2020, the video has achieved over 14 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the website.\\n\\nScientology\\'s purported influence on Cruise\\nIn 2013, Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple\\'s daughter Suri from Scientology. He also said that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the church.In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise\\'s next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, Cruise\\'s sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005. DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan. Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.The 2015 documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief cast a spotlight on Cruise\\'s role in Scientology. The film alleges that Cruise used Sea Org workers as a source of free labor. In the film, Cruise\\'s former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Tom Cruise\\'s suggestion, which Cruise\\'s lawyer denies.\\n\\nLegacy\\nIn 2006, Premiere ranked Cruise as Hollywood\\'s most powerful actor, as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine\\'s 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor. The same year, Forbes magazine ranked him as the world\\'s most powerful celebrity. The founder of CinemaScore in 2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the \"two stars, it doesn\\'t matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up\".October 10, 2006, was declared \"Tom Cruise Day\" in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because of \"his love for and close association with Japan.\" While reviewing Days of Thunder, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise\\'s 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the Tom Cruise Picture. Ebert listed nine key ingredients that make up the Tom Cruise Picture; the Cruise character, the mentor, the superior woman, the craft he must hone, the arena it takes place in, the arcana or knowledge he must learn, the trail or journey, the proto enemy, and the eventual enemy of the character. Some of Cruise\\'s later films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered to be part of this formula.\\n\\nWidescreenings compares two of these Cruise characters in an article on the film A Few Good Men,\\n[screenwriter] Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a \\'hot shot\\' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.\\n\\nLitigation\\nIn 1998, Tom Cruise successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality. Cruise won the libel case.In May 2001, Cruise filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had told the celebrity magazine Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise, and Slater was later ordered to pay $10 million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. Cruise requested a default judgment and, in January 2003, a Los Angeles judge decided against Slater after the porn actor said that his story was false.Cruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis for $100 million, because Davis had alleged (though never confirmed) that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.In 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise\\'s behest. That suit was dismissed by a Central Civil West court judge in Los Angeles on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired on Sapir\\'s claim.In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In Touch and Life & Style magazines for defamation after they claimed Cruise had \"abandoned\" his six-year-old daughter. During deposition, Cruise testified that due to his work load 110 days had passed without him seeing her. The suit was ultimately settled between the two parties.\\n\\nFilmography\\nAwards and nominations\\nSee also\\nProject Chanology § Tom Cruise video\\nRock of Ages soundtrack (2012)\\nSupercouple\\nTom Cruise: Unauthorized (1998)\\nTom Cruise: All the World\\'s a Stage (2006)\\nTom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography (2008)\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nTom Cruise – official site\\nTom Cruise at AllMovie\\nTom Cruise discography at Discogs\\nTom Cruise on Facebook\\nTom Cruise at IMDb\\nTom Cruise at the TCM Movie Database\\nTom Cruise on Twitter\\nTom Cruise on Yahoo!

              " \"Tom Cruise: All the World's a Stage\": 'Tom Cruise: All the World\\'s A Stage is an authorized biography of actor Tom Cruise, written by British film critic Iain Johnstone.  The book was first published by Hodder & Stoughton in a paperback format and an audiobook in 2006, and then again in a hardcover format on March 1, 2007, and a second paperback release, on May 1, 2007.\\n\\nContents\\nTom Cruise: All the World\\'s A Stage details some of Cruise\\'s early life, and his role as head of the family after his father left to become \"an itinerant hippy in California.\"  The author chronicles Cruise\\'s film career, including his first role in Endless Love in 1981, his breakthrough in Risky Business, and other popular films such as Top Gun, Jerry Maguire and the Mission: Impossible films.  He cites Cruise\\'s role as \"Frank Mackey\" in the film Magnolia as one of his best performances.  Johnstone also writes about Cruise\\'s relationships with Mimi Rogers and Nicole Kidman, and the luxurious lifestyle maintained by Cruise and Kidman during their relationship.  Johnstone puts Kidman in a sympathetic light regarding their 2001 divorce.The book discusses Cruise\\'s relationship with Scientology, and controversy in the media, including his public criticism of actress Brooke Shields, and his \"TV sofa-bouncing.\"  He also discusses the lengthy production of director Stanley Kubrick\\'s Eyes Wide Shut, noting the fact that Universal Studios and Paramount Pictures allowed representatives from the Church of Scientology to frequent the film sets during production.\\n\\nReception\\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian called the book \"an unpretentious model of clarity and humility, simply rounding up the known facts.\"  In his review of the 2006 edition of the book, Bradshaw wrote that Johnstone had presented a neutral overview of events in Cruise\\'s life, and did not offer any strong opinions of his own in the book.  He criticized the work for being \"incurious about what it is like\" to be Tom Cruise.  In his review in The Independent, William Cook described the tone of the book as \"respectful not reverential\".  Cook also wrote: \"Johnstone\\'s businesslike biog feels as if written at arm\\'s length - but this distance allows him to state some awkward facts about Cruise\\'s Scientology. It\\'s hard to believe he could have been quite so frank in an authorised biography.\"The book received a critical review in The West Australian, and a review in Australia\\'s The Daily Telegraph thought the book was almost \"dull\".  Christopher Bray of London\\'s The Daily Telegraph also criticized the work, and wrote that the book failed to answer any of the \"interesting questions\", commenting: \"You will read this book in vain for any suggestion that what we think we know of Cruise\\'s real life might be no more than PR smoke and mirrors.\"  In a review in The Spectator, Roger Lewis was critical of the book, and wrote: \"The eulogies Johnstone collects are endless.\"  Barbara Chabai of the Winnipeg Free Press also criticized the lack of depth to the work, writing that Johnstone \"has simply repackaged facts from Cruise\\'s interviews with other reporters into a neat but unfeeling tome that offers all the depth of an Entertainment Tonight feature.\"  Both The Guardian and the Winnipeg Free Press noted the absence of any discussion or mention of the controversial 2005 episode of South Park which spoofed Cruise, \"Trapped in the Closet\".\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nBeing Tom Cruise\\nRelationship of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\\nTrapped in the Closet (South Park)\\nTom Cruise: Unauthorized (1998)\\nTom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography (2008)\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",
              " 'Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography': 'Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography is an unauthorized biography of actor Tom Cruise, written by Andrew Morton.  The book was published in the United States in hardcover format on January 15, 2008 by St. Martin\\'s Press, with a first printing of 400,000 copies, and an audio format on five CDs by Macmillan Audio.Cruise\\'s lawyers and the Church of Scientology have released several statements which question the truthfulness of assertions made by Morton in the book. In an official 15-page statement released to the press, the Church called the book \"a bigoted, defamatory assault replete with lies\".  The book was not published in the United Kingdom or New Zealand due to strict libel laws in those countries. Although initially not published in Australia, it was later published there and became popular.The book hit number one on Amazon.com\\'s list of top sellers three days after it was published, and was number one on The New York Times Best Sellers list one week after publication. It was the number one bestseller in Australia for publisher AbeBooks in 2008. The book received mixed and critical reviews in The New York Times. The San Jose Mercury opined that it should be taken \"with the proper grain of salt\".\\n\\nContents\\nMorton\\'s book describes Cruise\\'s relationship with Katie Holmes, his sexuality, and Cruise and Holmes\\' beliefs.  Morton also asserts in the book that Holmes had to \"audition\" for the status of Cruise\\'s girlfriend, and won the part over other actresses.  The book also discusses details about Cruise\\'s marriages to Mimi Rogers and Nicole Kidman, his relationship with Penélope Cruz, his behavior on The Oprah Winfrey Show, and his denunciation of Brooke Shields for using anti-depressants to help her cope with postpartum depression. Morton consulted a former senior Scientologist, who asserted that Kidman\\'s lawyer had advised her not to publicly discuss Scientology or to speak out against it, even though she \"hated\" Scientology when Cruise left her in 2000.  Morton\\'s source stated \"I told the lawyer if she wants to stay with the children she will have to be quiet and not speak out about Scientology.\"  Morton writes that Holmes joined Scientology in June 2006, and agreed that \"if she or any of her children were ever to suffer mental or terminal illness, they must turn only to Scientology\\'s treatments\".  Morton asserts that model Sofia Vergara stopped seeing Cruise in 2005 weeks before he met Holmes, and Vergara felt \"she had been deliberately targeted not only as a possible bride for Tom, but as a high-profile Scientology recruit who would be an alluring figurehead for a future recruitment drive in Latin America\".Morton asserts in the book that Cruise is the \"de facto second-in-charge\" in the Church of Scientology.  When asked by the Associated Press what evidence he had about this, Morton stated \"Scientology would be a shadow of what it is today if it had not been for the involvement of Tom Cruise. He has been the poster boy. More than that, he has been recruiting fellow celebrities - people like Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith. ... More than that, he\\'s been the front man for the organization.\"Morton writes that Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige consults Cruise on \"every aspect of planning and policy,\" that Miscavige joined Cruise and Holmes on their 2006 honeymoon in the Maldives, and that Church of Scientology officials select many of the employees that staff Cruise\\'s mansion.  According to Morton, Miscavige invited Cruise to the Church of Scientology\\'s Gold Base in Hemet, California in 1989.Kidman and Cruise were invited to Gold Base in 1990 after spending time together on the set of Days Of Thunder.  Morton writes \"When Tom confided to the Scientology leader about the couple\\'s fantasy of running through a meadow of wild flowers together, his friend apparently decided to make his dream come true.\"  Morton writes that around the same time Cruise was beginning his relationship with Rogers, Miscavige made an announcement at a Church of Scientology rally, \"The most important recruit ever is in the process of being secured. His arrival will change the face of Scientology forever.\"\\n\\nResearch\\nAccording to Morton, he began researching Tom Cruise after publishing his best-selling book on Princess Diana, Diana: Her True Story. Morton stated that he became interested in writing about the actor after watching Cruise jump on Oprah\\'s couch during a May 23, 2005 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, and lecture Matt Lauer on his beliefs regarding psychiatry during a June 24, 2005 appearance on The Today Show \"I wondered: what is a 43-year-old man, who has been married twice before to women he has said were the loves of his life, with his son and daughter watching, doing behaving in this fashion — all because of Katie Holmes, a woman he has known for a matter of days? ... What was going on? I wanted to know more.\"In an interview with the Associated Press, Morton stated that he asked Cruise for an interview, but was turned down: \"I asked Tom for an interview and he declined. The Church of Scientology has got a very controversial reputation and that is what he is linked with. An unauthorized biography would essentially be a compromise … I want to investigate it without any kind of fetters.\"  Morton consulted with private investigator and former adult film actor Paul Baressi, who investigated Cruise\\'s private life.  He also consulted with Los Angeles, California attorney Graham Berry.  Baressi stated he had begun investigating Cruise after his marriage to Nicole Kidman ended, but after six years of research on the actor had not been able to find any evidence that Cruise was gay.  Baressi gave all of his research to Morton, and later told InTouch magazine:  \"Everything I have found, and everything I know, points to Tom being heterosexual.\"  Morton also traveled to Toronto, Ontario, Canada to interview people who knew Cruise when he was filming Cocktail.  Several Paramount Pictures employees were interviewed about Cruise\\'s termination by Sumner Redstone.  The book had initially been planned for a February 2006 publication date.Prior to the book\\'s publication, legal counsel for Cruise made statements to the press regarding the author\\'s research.  When an attorney for Tom Cruise read reports that Morton had obtained letters asserting Cruise had a homosexual affair while filming Eyes Wide Shut, he commented on a November 2005 letter he had written to Morton: \"I wrote a letter to Mr. Morton back in November and said he obviously was entitled to write the book but \\'make sure you check your facts\\'. If he tries to use my letter to create the impression that Mr. Cruise did have a gay affair, we will certainly sue … because the story is false. Mr. Cruise is not gay.\"  In an interview with InTouch Weekly, Cruise\\'s attorney Bertram Fields commented on the book: \"To the extent that Mr. Morton\\'s book sticks to the truth, it can\\'t \\'ruin\\' or \\'harm\\' Tom … My guess is this book will be dull except for those parts that are lies.\"  Cruise\\'s publicist also stated that the book will consist of fabricated lies.\\n\\nMedia coverage\\nOn November 11, 2007, the Daily Express reported that Andrew Morton had gone into hiding due to threats from Scientologists related to his work on the book.  Morton was quoted as stating: \"I have received threats from the Scientologists and things have become pretty heavy — to the extent that it\\'s almost more than my lawyers can handle … I’m not telling anyone where I’m moving to. I intend to disappear for a while.\"  This quote was later repeated in other media sources.  On November 23, 2007, the Daily Express issued an apology to the Church of Scientology.  The paper stated that their original piece about threats from Scientologists to Morton was incorrect, and wrote: \"We apologise to the Church of Scientology and its members for the embarrassment and distress caused by the article.\"  A December 2007 article in the New York Post stated: \"Mumbles out of London say Morton changed his phone number, moved from his home and lived in a secret place because Certain Persons were hassling him.\"When St. Martin\\'s Press heard of a November 2007 InTouch Weekly cover story on the contents of the book, the publisher responded by stating that InTouch had not received an advance copy of Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography and was simply speculating.  Brian Smith of St. Martin\\'s Press was interviewed for the InTouch article, and commented on the book: \"No one has dared to write a book like this.  So it\\'s going to really be dealing with stuff no one has written about before.\"\\n\\nResponse from Cruise and Church of Scientology\\nThe Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph reported that lawyers for Cruise are preparing a lawsuit against publisher St. Martin\\'s Press, seeking US$113 million in damages. Eliot Abelson, general counsel for the Church of Scientology, discussed the possibility of litigation from the Church in statements to the Daily Mail.  An article in The Times wrote \"The Church of Scientology is reported to be considering filing suit against the US publishers.\"The book has been criticized by representatives for both Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology.  In an interview with The Daily Mail, attorney Bertram Fields called the book a \"boring, poorly researched book by a man who never talked to anyone involved in Tom Cruise\\'s life or anyone close to him,\" and criticized what he believed to be Morton\\'s lack of independent research for the work.  Fields said that Cruise would not read the book, saying \"He has no intention of reading it. He\\'s very, very busy with a lot of things right now.\" Paula Wagner, Tom Cruise\\'s business partner in their company Cruise/Wagner Productions, released a statement supporting Cruise and criticizing Morton\\'s work.  Wagner called the book \"a disgraceful piece of gossip-mongering, filled with distortions and outright lies that no sensible person will take seriously\".Eliot Abelson said that the Church had attempted to contact Morton and give him a tour, but \"received nothing\".  Abelson stated \"This was a pre-ordained mission to trash Tom Cruise. He didn\\'t ask to speak to David Miscavige and wrote some horrible things about him which are totally untrue. No one has ever made complaints of that kind,\" and denied that Cruise was second-in-command of the Church of Scientology \"He is a parishioner, a well respected parishioner, but that\\'s what he is. The only person who runs the Church and makes policy decisions is David Miscavige.\"  \"It\\'s not too late for St. Martin\\'s Press to pull this book,\" Abelson said.On January 14, 2008, Church of Scientology public affairs director Karin Pouw released a 15-page statement criticizing the book.  In the statement, the Church of Scientology called the book \"a bigoted, defamatory assault replete with lies,\" and said that Cruise \"is a Scientology parishioner and holds no official or unofficial position in the Church hierarchy,\" and that \"Accuracy and truth were not on Morton\\'s agenda.\"  Cruise\\'s publicity firm Rogers & Cowan, also issued a statement, which criticized Morton for not interviewing \"one person who has known or worked with Tom\" in the past 25 years, and also criticized Morton for writing \"outlandish and malicious lies to sell books\".In January 2008 the niece of David Miscavige released a statement on the internet in favor of Morton\\'s book. Jenna Miscavige Hill, whose father Ron Miscavige is the older brother of David Miscavige, criticized Pouw\\'s statement about the book. Hill stated: \"I am absolutely shocked at how vehemently you insist upon not only denying the truths that have been stated about the church in that biography, but then take it a step further and tell outright lies.\" Hill\\'s statement was part of an open letter to a Church of Scientology official which described how her family had been broken apart by Scientology policies. In response, Karin Pouw told the Agence France-Presse \"The church stands by its statement of 14 January. The church does not respond to newsgroup postings.\" Hill told the Agence France-Presse that she had released the statement in a public forum to draw attention to the Scientology practice of disconnection.The book\\'s publisher, St. Martin\\'s Press, called the possibility of a lawsuit from Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology \"unfortunate\", stating \"It is unfortunate that lawyers for both Mr. Cruise and Scientology have felt the need to threaten us with legal action at every step of the way.\"  In a statement to Usmagazine.com the publisher supported Morton\\'s research on the book:  \"In the two years that we have worked with Andrew Morton on this book, we have been deeply impressed by his commitment to going beyond the rumors to get the facts that would enable him to paint a balanced and accurate portrait of such an enigmatic public figure.\"\\n\\nReception\\nSales\\nIn November 2007, Irish On-Line reported that the book would not be published in the United Kingdom, because it was anticipated not to contain anything \"sensational\" about Cruise that would make it a blockbuster.  An article in the New York Post attributed this to the \"scandalous\" nature of the book, and what the paper referred to as \"UK\\'s celebrity-friendly libel laws\". For similar reasons the book was not published by major booksellers in New Zealand and Australia, though an underground market for the book sprung up on auction site eBay there; the book was also available in some Australian independent bookstores, with buyers having to pay a significant premium on the cover price.  Copies of the book sold for over A$60 on eBay Australia, and one eBay seller commented \"These things don\\'t happen too often. The book has generated so much attention and the more people are hearing about it, the more that they want to buy it. The censorship factor has also had a major impact.\"The book hit number nine on Amazon.com\\'s list of top sellers the day it was published in the United States, and was at the number one spot three days after publication. Lycos reported that Internet searches for \"Tom Cruise\" jumped 333 percent the week the book was published.  The book hit number one on The New York Times Best Sellers list one week after it was published, and as of February 3, 2008 it was still at the top of the list for hardback non-fiction. As of January 25, 2008, the book was number 16 on Amazon.com\\'s top sellers. On January 31, 2008 the book was listed at number three in non-fiction on a list of \"Publishers Weekly Best-Sellers\" by the Associated Press, and reached the fifth-highest new entry on Nielsen BookScan\\'s survey in February 2008. Though certain bookstores in Australia refused to sell the book due to legal concerns, it was the number one bestseller in Australia for on-line bookseller AbeBooks in 2008, and the number one most-borrowed non-fiction book at libraries in Brisbane in September 2008.\\n\\nReviews\\nThe book received a mixed review in The New York Times, with Janet Maslin writing that \"Mr. Morton has found a number of former Scientologists who are willing to speak freely, and in some cases vengefully, about the group’s purported inner workings. Mr. Morton’s eagerness to include their voices leads him to push the limits of responsible reporting.\" She also stated that Morton, while \"readily assailable\" for some of his remarks in the book, \"is in some larger sense an astute observer. His overall impression of Mr. Cruise makes sense.\" In a separate review, Ada Calhoun of The New York Times wrote that Morton \"…champions the indignation of mostly anonymous former Scientologists in this brutal biography of the controversial religion’s most famous advocate, Tom Cruise\", noted that \"many attributed quotations lack sources\", and concluded her review with the observation that at times the book \"feels about as reliable as the tabloids and yet, astonishingly, somehow meaner.\" Writing in Entertainment Weekly, Mark Harris gave the book a grade of \"C-\", and said \"Cruise emerges from Morton\\'s takedown moderately scratched but as uncracked as ever.\"Teresa Budasi of the Chicago Tribune described the book as \"fascinating\" — though Budasi also brought up a \"question as to what’s true and what isn’t.\" Budasi summed up her impression of the work, writing \"Morton’s book is as much an indictment on Cruise’s chosen faith as it is the life story of one of the world’s biggest movie stars. And by the end you realize that “Scientologist” is what will end up being the role of his lifetime.\"Reviewing the book in The Wall Street Journal, Dave Shiflett said that Morton portrayed Cruise as \"a top-gun Scientologist who is up to no good,\" and that \"Mr. Morton, apparently unfazed by the reputation of the group\\'s notoriously hair-triggered legal department, leaves few stones unhurled.\" Stefanie Roberts of The Independent Florida Alligator wrote \"Author Andrew Morton\\'s narrative, though for the most part irritatingly unbiased, does a fair job of reaffirming how far gone Cruise truly is.\" Roberts wrote that the book would have drawn in more readers if it had \"taken a few more obvious jabs at Cruise.\" Writing in the San Jose Mercury News, Tony Hicks criticized parts of the work, and recommended that it be taken \"with the proper grain of salt\". Hicks wrote that \"Holes and all, it\\'s a hard book to put down, especially with wild tales of Scientology spilling forth page after page. The entertainment value falls off toward book\\'s end, when Morton attempts to wrap up his story with some editorializing and a diagnosis of both Cruise and his religion that, while seeming accurate to a degree, nevertheless comes off preachy.\"\\n\\nSee also\\nBeing Tom Cruise\\nRelationship of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\\nTrapped in the Closet (South Park)\\nTom Cruise: Unauthorized (1998)\\nTom Cruise: All the World\\'s A Stage (2006)\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\"Macmillan: Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography Andrew Morton: Books\".

              " 'Trapped in the Closet (South Park)': '\"Trapped in the Closet\" is the twelfth episode in the ninth season of the American animated television series South Park. The 137th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 16, 2005. In the episode, Stan joins Scientology in an attempt to find something \"fun and free\". After the discovery of his surprisingly high \"thetan levels\", he is recognized as the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the church. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. The title is a reference to the R. Kelly serialized song of the same name and a satirized version of R. Kelly appears in the episode.\\n\"Trapped in the Closet\" generated significant controversy. Tom Cruise, who is portrayed in the episode, reportedly threatened to back out of his promotional obligations for the Paramount Pictures film Mission: Impossible III if Viacom, the owner of both Comedy Central and Paramount, allowed a repeat airing of the episode. A publicist of Cruise denied this, saying \"Tom had nothing to do with this matter. He\\'s been promoting Mission: Impossible III for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from.\" Though the episode was originally scheduled for rebroadcast on March 15, 2006, the episode \"Chef\\'s Chocolate Salty Balls\" was shown instead. Comedy Central representatives stated this change was made as a tribute to Isaac Hayes, but South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone thought otherwise; they issued a satirical statement saying they (Parker and Stone) were \"servants of the dark lord Xenu\". Hayes, the voice of staple character Chef, asked to be released from his contract shortly before the start of the tenth season. The reason for his departure, as reported by Stone, was due to his membership in Scientology and this episode, which Hayes—despite initially supporting the show\\'s satirical take on several talk shows—claimed was very offensive. The episode has since been rebroadcast on Comedy Central multiple times.\\n\"Trapped in the Closet\" was nominated for an Emmy Award in July 2006, in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) category. The episode was featured among Comedy Central\\'s list of \"10 South Parks That Changed The World\", spoofed by Conan O\\'Brien in the opening segment of the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards, and mentioned in the Scientology critique film The Bridge. TV Guide ranked the episode #17 on its list of \"TV\\'s Top 100 Episodes of All Time\".\\n\\nPlot\\nStan takes a free \"personality test\" offered by Scientologists on the street. After answering a long questionnaire, Stan is informed that he is extremely depressed and therefore a perfect candidate for Scientology. They offer to help him out for $240. Back home, Stan asks his parents for the money. His father suggests that he use the money he had been saving for a bicycle. Stan pays the Scientologists and is taken into an auditing room where an attendant reads his \"thetan levels\" using an \"E-meter\". Stan has such a high reading that the Scientology headquarters in Los Angeles is notified. There, the president of Scientology determines that Stan\\'s high reading makes him a reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology\\'s founder and prophet.Later that night, a group of Scientologists, including John Travolta, gather outside the Marsh house to celebrate Hubbard\\'s \"second coming\". The president of Scientology arrives in a helicopter and talks with Stan\\'s parents. They are opposed to Stan\\'s participation, but the president informs them that \"we\\'re not asking him to join us; we\\'re asking him to lead us\". Randy sends Stan to his room, where he finds Tom Cruise waiting. Cruise asks him whether Stan has enjoyed his acting. When \"Hubbard\" replies that his acting is okay but not as good as others\\' such as Leonardo DiCaprio or the Napoleon Dynamite guy, Tom hears that he is \"a failure in the eyes of the prophet\" and locks himself in Stan\\'s closet. He refuses to come out, despite the protests of Randy, Nicole Kidman, the police, Travolta and R. Kelly to \"come out of the closet\". Travolta and Kelly eventually join Cruise in the closet.\\nDownstairs, the church president tries to convince Stan\\'s parents to allow their son to participate. He tells to Stan the great secret behind the church—a condensed version of the story of Xenu, according to the Scientology Operating Thetan III document. During this, an onscreen caption reads \"This is what Scientologists actually believe\". He then begs Stan to continue writing where \"L. Ron\" left off. Stan is impressed by the story and shows his writings to the president who initially approves of the work. Stan suggests that \"to really be a church, you can\\'t charge money to help\", to which the president admits to Stan that the church is in reality a global money-making scam. He asks that Stan continue with that in mind. Stan appears to agree and keeps writing.\\nOutside the house, the president introduces Stan to his followers, where he will read parts of his new doctrine. However, instead of presenting it to them, Stan states that he is not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, and that \"Scientology is just a big fat global scam\". The Scientologists and celebrities in the closet are angry and threaten to sue Stan. Stan dares them to sue, and the episode ends.\\nThe closing credits name only \"John Smith\" and \"Jane Smith\", a reference to Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology\\'s reputation for litigiousness.\\n\\nProduction\\nSouth Park had previously parodied Scientology in a spoof at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. The MTV short was titled \"The Gauntlet\" and included \"John Travolta and the Church of Scientology\" arriving in a spaceship to defeat Russell Crowe (as a gladiator) and attempt to recruit the boys into Scientology. Travolta, along with his fellow Scientologists, was depicted as a Psychlo, as he appeared in the film Battlefield Earth. They had also made fun of Scientology in an earlier episode, titled \"Super Best Friends\", in which David Blaine formed his own cult, called \"Blaintology\". Parker and Stone have acknowledged that this is meant to be a reference to Scientology.Parker stated that Isaac Hayes\\' membership had previously kept the show\\'s creators from writing a full episode which parodies Scientology. However, the decision to ultimately produce a South Park episode satirizing Scientology was partially inspired by the friendship the show\\'s creators have with Penn Jillette. Jillette was originally planning to do an episode of Bullshit! based on Scientology, but Showtime prohibited him from doing so to avoid the possibility of legal action from the Church of Scientology. Parker commented, \"We\\'re going, That\\'s fucked up. And hearing other people say, \\'You can\\'t do that\\' – you can only say \\'You can\\'t do that\\' so many times to Matt and me before we\\'re gonna do it. Finally, we just had to tell Isaac, \\'Dude, we totally love working with you, and this is nothing personal, it\\'s just we\\'re South Park, and if we don\\'t do this, we\\'re belittling everything else we\\'ve ripped on.\\'\"Although some questions were raised prior to the episode\\'s screening about whether it was wise to take swipes at Cruise and Scientology, Comedy Central declared that it supported Stone and Parker. A Comedy Central spokesman told Radar magazine in November 2005 that \"they are free, and have been, to satirize anybody and anything they want to. They\\'ve made fun of MTV, they\\'ve made fun of Viacom, they\\'ve made fun of Comedy Central, and we\\'ve never interfered with them.\"During production on the episode, investigative journalist Mark Ebner served as a consultant to Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Ebner had previously authored The New York Times best seller Hollywood, Interrupted, which includes an analysis of the Church of Scientology and its effects on the culture in Hollywood, and has a chapter on Tom Cruise and John Travolta\\'s relationship to Scientology. On the official Comedy Central website for the South Park episode, it is asserted that the section of \"Trapped in the Closet\" that explains Scientology\\'s portrayal and beliefs was not exaggerated: \"Nothing about what you see here is exaggerated in the slightest. Seriously.\" The title is a reference to the R. Kelly song of the same name, and a depiction of R. Kelly appears in the episode to sing a parody of it.\\n\\nControversy\\nIsaac Hayes\\' departure\\nOn March 13, 2006, Hayes, a Scientologist himself, announced that he was quitting the show because of the series\\' treatment of religion, saying, \"There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices.\" The Guardian observed that the show had mocked most other religions, but that he drew the line at Scientology. Later in an interview on CNN\\'s Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, \"Guys, you have it all wrong. We\\'re not like that. I know that\\'s your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they\\'re doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do.\"Responding to Hayes\\' departure, Stone asserted that \"This is 100 percent having to do with his faith of Scientology... He has no problem—and he\\'s cashed plenty of checks—with our show making fun of Christians.\" According to Stone, neither he nor Trey Parker had \"heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin.\" Stone commented that \"In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons and Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. To bring the civil rights struggle into this is just a non sequitur. Of course we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well.\" According to a later commentary by Stone, prior to the episode\\'s screening Hayes had asked the South Park creators to have Comedy Central pull the episode before it aired and not include it in the series DVD, which they refused.There were many conflicting stories as to the exact nature of Hayes\\' departure. Additional reasons given by Hayes ten months after the departure include \"They didn\\'t pay me enough\", and \"They weren\\'t that nice\". In late 2007, reports emerged claiming that Hayes was in no condition to stay, because of a stroke he suffered in January. According to a Fox News article, Hayes\\' agent Christina Kimball, herself a practicing Scientologist, was the source of the statements that Hayes quit South Park. Stone lent support to this view in a 2007 interview with Rolling Stone, commenting that \"There are reports that Isaac had a stroke and Scientology quit the show for him, and I believe it... It was a brutal, up-close, personal thing with Isaac. If you look at the timeline, something doesn\\'t add up.\" Due to the absence of Hayes, Chef was voiced in \"The Return of Chef\" using pre-recorded snippets of dialog from previous episodes. The character was written out of the series by being struck by lightning, burned, impaled, shot, and mauled at the end of the episode.\\n\\nTom Cruise parody\\nThe creators used the ambiguity of \"coming out of the closet\", having Tom Cruise literally refusing to come out of Stan\\'s closet, in a parody of rumors that Cruise was homosexual. Cruise has a documented history of litigation against others involving rumors as to his sexuality, and some speculated whether Cruise could sue South Park. Entertainment Weekly asked in December 2005 whether South Park was \"cruisin\\' for a bruisin\\'\" and wondered \"how that sort of Cruise-bashing is going to go over with Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone\\'s new bosses: Paramount Pictures just inked the dudes to a three-year deal. Other people with Paramount deals? Oh, just, you know, Tom Cruise. Should be one hell of a studio Christmas party\".Concerns over possible litigation were raised in other countries where South Park is syndicated. The episode\\'s planned screening on the UK\\'s Paramount Comedy 1 channel was canceled for fear that Cruise would sue. In Australia, SBS TV screened the episode in late February, a spokesman telling Australian The Daily Telegraph that \"We haven\\'t received any legal threats so we\\'re going to publish and be damned.\"\\n\\nClosetgate\\nThis episode was scheduled to rebroadcast on March 15, 2006, on Comedy Central, but the broadcast was canceled without prior notice, and was replaced with \"Chef\\'s Chocolate Salty Balls\". Representatives of Comedy Central insist that the episode was changed as a tribute to Isaac Hayes following his departure from the show two days earlier. The following day, the Hollywoodinterrupted.com blog alleged that Comedy Central parent Viacom canceled the rebroadcast due to threats of Cruise to boycott the publicity tour of his upcoming film Mission: Impossible III. These assertions were soon also reported by E! News and American Morning. Fox News attributed threats from Tom Cruise, stating, \"to back out of his Mission: Impossible III promotional duties if Viacom didn\\'t pull a repeat of the episode\", as evidence of \"bad blood\" between Cruise and Viacom (which also owns Paramount Pictures, the distributor of MI:III). CNN\\'s The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer also cited \"industry sources\" who believed the episode was pulled \"because the network and Tom Cruise\\'s current movie studio are both owned by the same corporation.\" The New York Post noted that Cruise had \"a history of playing hardball\", alleging that he had been responsible for having a sex scene featuring his then-fiancée Katie Holmes removed from the film Thank You for Smoking prior to its release.The Washington Post reported that South Park fans \"struck back\", in March 2006, and threatened to boycott Mission: Impossible III until Comedy Central put \"Trapped in the Closet\" back on its schedule. Melissa McNamara of CBS News later questioned whether this boycott hurt the Mission: Impossible III box office debut. The South Park creators did not comment directly on Comedy Central\\'s decision to pull the episode, reportedly because they had been told not to discuss the matter to avoid embarrassing Cruise. Instead, they issued a statement to Variety on March 17, 2006, signing the statement, \"Trey Parker and Matt Stone, servants of the dark lord Xenu\".The Los Angeles Times dubbed the controversy surrounding the episode\\'s rebroadcast \"Closetgate\". The Independent later cited the Los Angeles Times, noting that the controversy generated positive publicity for the show\\'s creators: \"For Stone and Parker, Closetgate will be the gift that keeps on giving.\" \"Closetgate\" has since been used to refer to the \"brouhaha\" surrounding Isaac Hayes\\' departure and rebroadcasts of the episode, by other sources including Yahoo! Movies, BBC, Turner Classic Movies, the Herald-Sun, Thoralf Fagertun of the University of Tromsø, and the Chicago Sun-Times.Cruise\\'s representative responded to the controversy shortly after it broke, telling the Associated Press that the allegations of Cruise\\'s involvement were \"not true\" and that \"he never said that\". According to The Washington Post, Cruise\\'s publicist asserted that \"Tom had nothing to do with this matter. He\\'s been promoting \\'Mission: Impossible III\\' for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from.\" Cruise himself addressed the allegations in an interview on ABC\\'s Primetime in mid-April. When asked about whether he had been involved with stopping the rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated, \"First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here\\'s the thing: I\\'m really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn\\'t really even know about it. I\\'m working, making my movie, I\\'ve got my family. I\\'m busy. I don\\'t spend my days going, \\'What are people saying about me?\\'\"In April 2006, TelevisionWeek reported that fans had posted the episode in multiple locations on the internet. At that time, the episode had been viewed over 700,000 times on YouTube, and an online petition to re-air the episode had garnered 5,000 signatures. TelevisionWeek noted that Comedy Central \"looked the other way at the online proliferation\" of \"Trapped in the Closet\". A spokesman for MTV Networks, owner of Comedy Central, confirmed they had not asked YouTube to pull the episode from their site. The Situation Room also noted that clips from the episode were still available on Comedy Central\\'s web site. In May 2006, \"Trapped in the Closet\" was shown in London, at the National Film Theatre. The free screening was followed by a discussion with Parker and Stone, who said the screening was a \"display of free speech\". Free copies of the episode were given out to attendees after the screening.\\n\\nOn July 19, 2006, Comedy Central did air a rebroadcast of the episode at 10:00 Pacific Time and did so again on July 23 at 11:00pm Eastern Time and on September 24 at 10:00 PM Eastern time. Matt Stone stated \"If they hadn\\'t put this episode back on the air, we\\'d have had serious issues, and we wouldn\\'t be doing anything else with them.\" After the episode was scheduled to be rebroadcast, Trey Parker and Matt Stone were interviewed on CNN\\'s Showbiz Tonight, where they stated that all of the controversy increased publicity for the episode. Parker was quoted: \"But it\\'s really like a publicist couldn\\'t have orchestrated this any better for us. You know what I mean? It\\'s like it\\'s been phenomenal. Tom Cruise has done more for South Park than anyone I think in the world.\"\\n\\nThe episode was released in several DVDs, including South Park the Hits: Volume 1 and South Park: The Complete Ninth Season, in contradiction with an alleged request by either the Church of Scientology or Cruise to never put the episode on DVD format. The full episode is also available for viewing on the web site of South Park Digital Studios, along with Parker and Stone\\'s \\'mini-commentary\\' on it.\\nA few references have been made by the show and Comedy Central to Scientology as an aftermath of the controversy. On August 1, 2006, Comedy Central placed an advertisement in Variety showing the South Park stars against a background of L. Ron Hubbard\\'s Scientology Celebrity Center, with the headline, \"C\\'mon Jews, show them who really runs Hollywood.\" Although often misunderstood by the public to parody the Mel Gibson DUI incident, the advertisement actually congratulates South Park on gaining an Emmy nomination for \"Trapped in the Closet\" and satirizes the cancellation of the episode\\'s rebroadcast in March.The Rolling Stone cover article \"Still Sick, Still Wrong\", celebrating the show\\'s anniversary, also referred to the controversy. The article depicted Stone and Parker spray painting graffiti on the church\\'s Los Angeles organization sign, adding \"Is dum\" to the Scientology logo and a \"Hi Tom\" message with an accompanying depiction of Cartman\\'s head.\\n\\nReception\\nIn a review of South Park: The Complete Ninth Season, The Denver Post stated the jokes about Tom Cruise \"work splendidly and reveal their depth on repeated viewings, much like the show in general.\" IGN stated that \"Perhaps the largest weakness of this season is that the most notorious episodes Best Friends Forever and Trapped in the Closet just don\\'t carry the eye-popping impact that they did when they were ripped from the headlines\", giving the DVD a rating of 7.0. The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Matt Stone and Trey Parker \"probably hit their zenith when they made fun of Tom Cruise and Scientology\". An article in The Times wrote that South Park \"infamously satirized\" texts by L. Ron Hubbard \"available only to Operating Thetans\". TV Guide ranked the episode #17 on its 2009 list of \"TV\\'s Top 100 Episodes of All Time\".\\n\\nAnalysis\\nAn article in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion referred to the episode as a \"scathing cartoon parody\" of the Church of Scientology. University of Delaware philosophy professor Richard Hanley analyzed the mythology of Scientology, as it relates to the episode \"Trapped in the Closet\", in his 2007 book South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating. Hanley called the Xenu story as presented in the episode, \"utterly ridiculous\". Hanley went on to delve into a philosophical analysis of the \"evidential weight\" of popularity and tradition in determining the \"robustness\" of beliefs.Southwest Minnesota State University philosophy professor Robert Arp also analyzed the philosophical and cultural aspects of the episode in his book South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today. Arp analyzed Comedy Central\\'s reaction to the episode itself, in a section of his book entitled \"2005–2006: Comedy Central Caves\". Arp mentions South Park\\'s usage of the onscreen caption—\"This is what Scientologists actually believe\"—in the episode, noting that the same device was used in the episode \"All About the Mormons?\" In referencing this similar use of the onscreen caption device, Arp seemed to point to an inconsistency in the behavior of Comedy Central relative to the episode. He explained, \"By a long shot, this show was more kind to Scientology than was \\'All About the Mormons\\' to Mormonism.\" He noted Comedy Central had suggested it would not rebroadcast the episode for the second time, though it later announced on July 12, 2006, that it would.\\n\\nAwards\\nThe organization Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network, founded by Lawrence Wollersheim, named the South Park staff their \"FACTNet Person(s) of the Year for 2005\" for this episode. Robert Arp cited the series winning a Peabody Award due to its willingness to criticize intolerance in April 2006 as a \"special concern for criticizing and countering intolerance\", and the notion that \"the Church of Scientology suffers from the widely held perceptions that it seeks to silence former members and others who criticize its beliefs and practices\", as the motivation behind the episode.Stone and Parker submitted the episode for an Emmy Award, though Stone admitted that \"We did it to be jerks. A \\'fuck you\\' to Comedy Central.\" To their surprise the episode was nominated on July 6, 2006, in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) category, the show\\'s sixth nomination (one of which they won, for 2005\\'s \"Best Friends Forever\"). The Simpsons episode \"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\" was the eventual recipient of the award. It was also among Comedy Central\\'s list of \"10 South Parks That Changed The World\", which started airing at September 24, 2006, in anticipation of the premiere of the second half of South Park\\'s tenth season.\\n\\nLegacy\\nThe scene where Cruise enters the closet is referenced in the South Park segment of the opening of the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 27, 2006, in which Conan O\\'Brien is trying to get to the show, but suddenly appears in Stan\\'s room in an animated form. Stan begins yelling at him as he runs into the nearby closet. Immediately following the entrance, he exits the closet and says, \"There\\'s someone else in there\", referring to Cruise, and leaves the door open. Cruise then pops out and closes the door.There is a scene in the film The Bridge by Brett Hanover, where two young women looking for a laugh tell a Scientology volunteer they learned about the organization from South Park. The volunteer answers that she has not seen the episode in question, and the two women later leave during the middle of an orientation video.On February 8, 2013, while appearing on the Opie & Anthony Show, Jenna Miscavige Hill, the niece of the Chairman of Scientology, David Miscavige, admitted that she first learned about the story of Xenu from watching this episode.\\n\\nSee also\\nScientology in popular culture\\nSouth Park controversies\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\"Trapped in the Closet\" Full episode at South Park Studios\\n\"Trapped in the Closet\" Episode guide at South Park Studios\\n\"Trapped in the Closet\" at IMDb\\n\"Trapped in the Closet\" TV.com episode guide\\nReviews, archived articles, IGN\\nOff-screen antics cost Cruise, Herald Sun, gallery of controversy involving Tom Cruise, picture 2 discusses \"Closetgate\"\\nTrapped in the Closet South Park Archives (Wikia)',\n",
              " 'Vanilla Sky': 'Vanilla Sky is a 2001 American science fiction psychological thriller film directed, written, and co-produced by Cameron Crowe. It is an English-language adaptation of Alejandro Amenábar\\'s 1997 Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which was written by Amenábar and Mateo Gil, with Penélope Cruz reprising her role from the original film. The film has been described as \"an odd mixture of science fiction, romance and reality warp\".The film stars Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz, with Jason Lee and Kurt Russell in supporting roles. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song, as well as Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe Award nominations for Diaz\\'s performance.\\n\\nPlot\\nDavid Aames, the owner of a large publishing company he inherited from his father, is in prison. Wearing a prosthetic mask, David tells his life story to court psychologist Dr. Curtis McCabe.\\nIn flashbacks, David leaves the duties of the publisher to his father\\'s trusted associates while living as a playboy in Manhattan. He is introduced to Sofia Serrano by his best friend, Brian Shelby, during a party. David and Sofia spend the night together at Sofia\\'s apartment and fall in love, unaware that David\\'s current lover, Julie Gianni, has followed them there. As David leaves, Julie offers him a ride, and soon reveals her jealousy of Sofia. She purposely crashes the car, killing herself and drastically disfiguring David.\\nDoctors cannot completely repair David\\'s face using plastic surgery, leaving it scarred and misshapen. David wears a prosthetic mask around others, but the mental and physical scarring from the accident causes him to become withdrawn and depressed. Brian convinces David to join him and Sofia at a club, but David ends up drunk and insults the two. They leave him to wallow in the street outside the club.\\nThe next morning, Sofia returns to David, asleep on the street, and apologizes to him. She takes him home, and over time, helps David emotionally recover. Doctors find a way to surgically repair David\\'s face despite their prior prognosis. While David\\'s life seems perfect, he notices strange oddities, such as brief visions of his distorted face, and a man at a bar who tells David that he could control the world and everyone in it. One day, while at Sofia\\'s, David wakes up to find himself facing Julie, with all the photos of Sofia\\'s face replaced by Julie\\'s. Out of confusion and shock, he suffocates Julie. David is arrested and imprisoned, and finds his face no longer reconstructed and he\\'s once again wearing the mask.\\nDr. McCabe conducts several more interviews, which serve to help David to recall the name \"Life Extension\". Seeing a company with that name nearby, McCabe arranges to take David there under guard. The company representative Rebecca explains how Life Extension uses cryonic suspension to save those with terminal illnesses until a cure can be found, keeping them in a lucid dream state to otherwise exercise their mind. David realizes that he is in his own lucid dream, escapes McCabe and the guards while calling for \"tech support\", and rushes for the building\\'s lobby, which is suddenly empty. An elevator opens, revealing the strange man from the bar, who invites him in.\\nAs the elevator climbs to the top of an impossibly tall building, the man explains to David he is tech support, and that David has been in suspension for 150 years, starting shortly after the night at the club where Sofia broke up with him. David opted for Life Extension to be woken when technology could repair his face, and left the publishing company in the hands of his father\\'s associates. As part of the program, David had opted for a lucid dream based on the \"vanilla sky\" from a Claude Monet painting The Seine at Argenteuil, starting the morning after Sofia\\'s breakup. However, the equipment had merged elements of his subconscious, such as Julie, or McCabe as his father figure, within his dream, forcing them to pull him out of the lucid dream state.\\nThey emerge on the rooftop, high above the clouds. Tech support tells David that while they have fixed his lucid dream, he has a choice of either being put back into the dream, or to be woken up in reality, requiring a literal leap of faith off the roof that will wake him from his sleep. David opts to wake up, despite a vision of McCabe warning him against it. Before jumping, David envisions Brian and Sofia to say his goodbyes. David jumps and his life flashes before his eyes before hitting the ground. A female voice commands him to \"open your eyes\", and David opens his eyes.\\n\\nAlternative ending version\\nThe 2015 Blu-ray release offers the option to watch the film with an alternative ending. This ending expands on the details at the end of the film. While it all leads to the same conclusion, there are additional scenes, alternative takes, and alternative dialogue.\\nAfter Rebecca describes the lucid dream, David rushes out of the room but does not immediately dash towards the elevator. He meets McCabe in the restroom who tries to convince him that this is all a hoax and a con and that his case is going to trial. David tells him that he\\'s only in his imagination. Much like in the theatrical cut, the Beach Boys\\' \"Good Vibrations\" plays, but this version makes it clear that David hears the music and that he chose it; meanwhile McCabe tries to convince him there is no music.\\nAt this point, David dashes out of the restroom for the elevator the way he does in the theatrical cut, but the scene in the lobby is expanded: David shoots the police officer who is firing at him and is then surrounded by a SWAT team whom McCabe tries to talk down, but the SWAT team fires at both of them. They black out and wake up in the emptied lobby where McCabe continues to applaud what he believes is a performance while David gets into the elevator with Ventura, who tells him what happened at the end of his real life.\\nOnce they reach the roof, McCabe re-enters again and his pleas to David not to believe Ventura become more and more desperate until he collapses onto the ground in despair. David\\'s interaction with Sofia is extended as he tells her he loves her but \"can\\'t settle for a dream\". He then jumps off the building, screaming \"I want to wake up!\" as images from his life flash before his eyes. He wakes up in bed and a voice tells him \"Open your eyes. You\\'re going to be fine.\"\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nAfter the American debut of Alejandro Amenábar\\'s 1997 Spanish film Abre los ojos (Open Your Eyes) at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, Tom Cruise and his producing partner Paula Wagner optioned the remake rights. Hoping to entice director Cameron Crowe, who collaborated with Cruise on Jerry Maguire, Cruise invited Crowe over to his house to view the film. Cruise has stated:\\n\\nI\\'ve been offered a lot of films to buy and remake, and I never have because I felt it was too connected with the culture of that place, whatever country it was from. But this was a universal story that was still open-ended, that still felt like it needed another chapter to be told.\\n\\nThe title of the film is a reference to depictions of skies in certain paintings by Claude Monet. In addition to Monet\\'s impressionistic artwork, the film\\'s tone was derived from the acoustic ballad \"By Way of Sorrow\" by Julie Miller and a line from an early interview of Elvis Presley in which he said, \"I feel lonely, even in a crowded room.\"\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography for Vanilla Sky began in late 2000 and lasted six weeks. On November 12, 2000, shooting for the scene of the deserted Times Square in New York took place in the early hours of the day. A large section of traffic was blocked off around Times Square while the scene was shot. \"There was a limit on how long the city would let us lock everything up even on an early Sunday morning when much of NYC would be slow getting up,\" said Steadicam operator Larry McConkey. \"Several times we rehearsed with Steadicam and Crane including a mockup of an unmovable guardrail that we had to work the crane arm around. [Cruise] participated in these rehearsals as well so we shared a clear understanding of what my limitations and requirements would be.\"Filming lasted for six weeks around the New York City area, which included scenes in Central Park, the Upper West Side, SoHo, and Brooklyn. One prominent location in the area was the Condé Nast Building that served as Aames Publishing and David\\'s office. After filming finished in New York, production moved to Los Angeles, where the remaining interior shots were completed at Paramount Studios. Crowe intentionally left in shots of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks as a tribute.Despite the film\\'s distorted aspects of reality, the style of cinematography remains grounded for much of the film. \"I didn\\'t do anything that was overtly obvious, because the story revolves around the main character not knowing whether he\\'s in a state of reality, a dream or a nightmare, so we want it to feel a little ambiguous,\" said cinematographer John Toll. \"We want the audience to make discoveries as [Cruise]\\'s character does, rather than ahead of him.\" American Cinematographer magazine wrote a feature story on the lighting designer Lee Rose\\'s work on the film.\\n\\nMusic\\nAside from the opening sequence featuring Radiohead\\'s song \"Everything in its Right Place\" and selected works by Icelandic group Sigur Rós, Vanilla Sky\\'s score was by Crowe\\'s then wife, Nancy Wilson, who also scored Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous. Wilson spent nine months on the film\\'s music, which was done through experimentation of sound collages. \"We were trying to balance out the heaviness of the story with sugary pop-culture music,\" she said. \"We made sound collages of all kinds. We were channeling Brian Wilson to a large extent. I was recording things through hoses, around corners, playing guitars with cello bows, and with [music editor] Carl Kaller, we tried all kinds of wacky stuff. In the murder–sex scene sound collage, Cameron even used Brian Wilson\\'s speaking voice from a Pet Sounds mix session.\"\\n\\nInterpretations\\nAccording to Cameron Crowe\\'s commentary, there are five different interpretations of the ending:\\n\\n\"Tech support\" is telling the truth: 150 years have passed since Aames killed himself and subsequent events form a lucid dream.\\nThe entire film is a dream, evidenced by a sticker on Aames\\' car that reads \"2/30/01\" (February 30 does not occur in the Gregorian calendar).\\nThe events following the crash form a dream that occurs while Aames is in a coma.\\nThe entire film is the plot of the book that Brian is writing.\\nThe entire film after the crash is a hallucination caused by the drugs that were administered during Aames\\' reconstructive surgery.Crowe notes that the presence of \"Vanilla Sky\"—the morning reunion after the club scene—marks the first lucid dream scene, and that everything that follows is a dream.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nVanilla Sky opened at #1 at the box office in the United States when it was first presented on December 14, 2001. The opening weekend took in a gross income of $25,015,518 (24.9%). The final domestic gross income was $100.61 million while the international gross income was slightly higher at $102.76m for a total worldwide gross income of $203,388,341.\\n\\nCritical response\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 42% based on reviews from 170 critics, and an average rating of 5.34/10. The site\\'s consensus states: \"An ambitious mix of genres, Vanilla Sky collapses into an incoherent jumble. Cruise\\'s performance lacks depth, and it\\'s hard to feel sympathy for his narcissistic character.\" On Metacritic it has a score of 45 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating \"Mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"D-\" on a scale from A to F.Roger Ebert\\'s printed review of Vanilla Sky awarded the film three out of four stars: \"Think it all the way through, and Cameron Crowe\\'s Vanilla Sky is a scrupulously moral picture. It tells the story of a man who has just about everything, thinks he can have it all, is given a means to have whatever he wants, and loses it because—well, maybe because he has a conscience. Or maybe not. Maybe just because life sucks. Or maybe he only thinks it does. This is the kind of movie you don\\'t want to analyze until you\\'ve seen it two times.\" Ebert interpreted the ending as an explanation for \"the mechanism of our confusion\", rather than a device that tells \"us for sure what actually happened.\"Film critic Richard Roeper ranked the film the second best of 2001.Stephen Holden of The New York Times calls Vanilla Sky a \"highly entertaining, erotic science-fiction thriller that takes Mr. Crowe into Steven Spielberg territory\", but then says: \"As it leaves behind the real world and begins exploring life as a waking dream (this year\\'s most popular theme in Hollywood movies with lofty ideas), Vanilla Sky loosens its emotional grip and becomes a disorganised and abstract if still-intriguing meditation on parallel themes. One is the quest for eternal life and eternal youth; another is guilt and the ungovernable power of the unconscious mind to undermine science\\'s utopian discoveries. David\\'s redemption ultimately consists of his coming to grips with his own mortality, but that redemption lacks conviction.\"Salon.com called Vanilla Sky an \"aggressively plotted puzzle picture, which clutches many allegedly deep themes to its heaving bosom without uncovering even an onion-skin layer of insight into any of them.\" The review rhetorically asks: \"Who would have thought that Cameron Crowe had a movie as bad as Vanilla Sky in him? It\\'s a punishing picture, a betrayal of everything that Crowe has proved he knows how to do right. ... But the disheartening truth is that we can see Crowe taking all the right steps, the most Crowe-like steps, as he mounts a spectacle that overshoots boldness and ambition and idiosyncrasy and heads right for arrogance and pretension—and those last two are traits I never would have thought we\\'d have to ascribe to Crowe.\" Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film 2/4 and wrote: \"The film\\'s aim—to dazzle and inspire—is sapped by Cruise\\'s vein-popping, running-the-marathon performance.\"Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian and Gareth Von Kallenbach of the publication Film Threat compared Vanilla Sky unfavorably to Open Your Eyes. Bradshaw says Open Your Eyes is \"certainly more distinctive than\" Vanilla Sky, which he describes as an \"extraordinarily narcissistic high-concept vanity project for producer-star Tom Cruise.\" Other reviewers extrapolate from the knowledge that Cruise had bought the rights to do a version of Amenábar\\'s film. A Village Voice reviewer characterized Vanilla Sky as \"hauntingly frank about being a manifestation of its star\\'s cosmic narcissism\".Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called Cameron Diaz \"compelling as the embodiment of crazed sensuality\" and The New York Times reviewer said she gives a \"ferociously emotional\" performance. Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly says of the film, \"most impressive is Cameron Diaz, whose fatal-attraction stalker is both heartbreaking and terrifying.\" For her performance, Diaz won multiple critics\\' groups awards, as well as being nominated for the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics\\' Choice Movie Award, Saturn Award, and AFI Award. Penélope Cruz\\'s performance, however, earned her a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress (in addition to her roles in Blow and Captain Corelli\\'s Mandolin).\\n\\nSee also\\nSimulated reality in fiction\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nEyes and Ears for Vanilla Sky at Cameron Crowe\\'s Official website\\nVanilla Sky at IMDb\\nVanilla Sky at AllMovie',\n",
              " 'War of the Worlds (2005 film)': 'War of the Worlds is a 2005 American science fiction action film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Josh Friedman and David Koepp, loosely based on the 1898 similarly-titled novel by H. G. Wells and jointly produced and released by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures. It stars Tom Cruise with Dakota Fanning, Justin Chatwin, Miranda Otto, and Tim Robbins in supporting roles. It also features narration by Morgan Freeman. The film follows an American dock worker who is forced to look after his children, from whom he lives separately, as he struggles to protect them and reunite them with their mother when extraterrestrials invade the Earth and devastate cities with giant war machines. This was Gene Barry\\'s final film before his retirement that year and his death in 2009.\\nThe film was shot in 73 days, using five different sound stages as well as locations in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia. The film was surrounded by a secrecy campaign so few details would be leaked before its release. Tie-in promotions were made with several companies, including Hitachi.\\nWar of the Worlds was released in North America on June 29, 2005 and in United Kingdom on July 1, 2005, by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly those of Cruise and Fanning), Spielberg\\'s direction, screenplay, action sequences and visual effects. It grossed over $603 million worldwide, making it the fourth most successful film of 2005. The film earned three Academy Awards nominations for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing.\\n\\nPlot\\nThe plot begins with an opening narration explaining that Earth was being observed by extraterrestrials with immense intelligence and no compassion. As man dominated the world without doubt, much like microorganisms swarming in a drop of water, these beings plotted to take it all from us.\\nDivorced longshoreman Ray Ferrier works as a crane operator at a dock in Brooklyn, New York, and is estranged from his children: 10-year-old daughter Rachel, and teenage son Robbie. Ray\\'s pregnant former wife, Mary Ann, drops the two off at his house in Bayonne, New Jersey, on her way to visit her parents in Boston.\\nLater, a strange storm occurs during which lightning strikes multiple times into the middle of a local intersection, causing an EMP that disrupts all technology and electricity. Ray joins the crowd at the scene of the impacts, where a massive \"tripod\" war machine emerges from the ground and uses powerful energy weapons to destroy the area, disintegrating most of the witnesses into a grey dust. Ray collects his children, steals a van that had just been repaired, and drives to Mary Ann\\'s empty home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge. That night, they take shelter in the basement, but they soon hear a strange roaring noise followed by an explosion, which destroys the house. The next morning, Ray discovers a Boeing 747 had crashed into the neighborhood wherein he meets a wandering news team surveying the wreckage and scavenging meals from it. The team explains to him there are multiple tripods that have attacked major cities around the world, adding that the tripods have force shields to protect them from human weapons, and the tripods\\' pilots traveled to Earth within the lightning storms as a way to enter their machines, which are assumed to have been buried underground for millions of years.\\nRay decides to drive the kids to Boston to be with their mother, but a desperate mob swarms their vehicle, forcing them to abandon it. They eventually get to a Hudson River ferry only to be surrounded by tripods, which either massacre or abduct many of the refugees, but Ray\\'s family manages to escape. They then witness U.S. Marines engaging in a futile battle with some tripods; Ray tries to stop Robbie from joining the fight, but is reluctantly forced to release him so he can take Rachel to safety. Ray and Rachel flee as the machines annihilate the marines, and are offered shelter in a farmhouse basement by a deranged man named Harlan Ogilvy.\\nThe three remain undetected for several days, even as a probe and a group of the tripods\\' alien pilots explore the basement. They soon discover the aliens have started cultivating a red-colored vegetation across the landscape that is quickly spreading; the group deduces the aliens are modifying Earth to make it more like their home planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown upon witnessing the tripods harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Fearing Ogilvy\\'s mad shouting will alert the aliens, Ray reluctantly kills him. A second tripod probe catches the Ferriers sleeping; Rachel flees and is abducted by a nearby tripod, and Ray joins her after picking up a belt of grenades. With help from other abductees, Ray uses the grenades to destroy the tripod from within, freeing them all.\\nRay and Rachel arrive in Boston, where they find the alien vegetation withering and the tripods inexplicably collapsing. When an active tripod appears, Ray notices birds landing on it, indicating that its shields are now offline. Ray successfully alerts the soldiers escorting the fleeing crowd, who shoot it down using anti-tank missiles. As the soldiers advance on the downed tripod, a hatch opens and a sickly alien struggles halfway out before dying. Ray and Rachel finally reach Mary Ann\\'s parents\\' house, where they are reunited with Mary Ann and Robbie (who somehow managed to survive).\\nA closing narration explains the aliens\\' deaths was due to their immune systems being unable to handle the countless billions of microbes that inhabit the Earth, and that humanity has \"earned\" the right to the planet by virtue of naturally coexisting with the rest of its biosphere.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nAfter collaborating in 2002\\'s Minority Report, Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise were interested in working together again. Spielberg stated about Cruise, \"He\\'s such an intelligent, creative partner, and brings such great ideas to the set that we just spark each other. I love working with Tom Cruise.\" Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg\\'s Catch Me If You Can (2002) and gave three options of films to create together, one of them being an adaptation of The War of the Worlds. Spielberg chose The War of the Worlds and stated, \"We looked at each other and the lights went on. As soon as I heard it, I said \\'Oh my God! War of the Worlds – absolutely.\\'  That was it.\"The film is Spielberg\\'s third on the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and longtime collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. \"When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. Now, he\\'s telling that story.\" Spielberg stated that he just thought it would be fun to make a \"really scary film with really scary aliens\", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.\\nJ. J. Abrams was asked by Spielberg and Cruise to write the script but had to turn down the film as he was working on the plot for his television series Lost. Josh Friedman delivered a screenplay, which was then rewritten by David Koepp. After re-reading the novel, Koepp decided to do the script following a single narrator, \"a very limited point of view, from someone on the very periphery of events rather than someone involved in events\", and created a list of elements he would not use due to being \"cliché\", such as the destruction of landmark buildings. Some aspects of the book were heavily adapted and condensed: Tim Robbins\\' character was an amalgam of two characters in the book, with the name borrowed from a third. While changing the setting from 19th century to present day, Koepp also tried to \"take the modern world back to the 1800s\", with the characters being devoid of electricity and modern techniques of communication.Spielberg accepted the script after finding it had several similarities to his personal life, including the divorce of his parents (Ray and Mary Ann\\'s divorce), and because the plight of the fictional survivors reflects his own uncertainty after the devastation of the September 11 attacks. For Spielberg, the characters\\' stories of survival needed to be the main focus, as they featured the American mindset of never giving up. Spielberg described War of the Worlds as \"a polar opposite\" to Close Encounters, with that movie featuring a man leaving family to travel with aliens, while War of the Worlds focused on keeping the family together. At the same time, the aliens and their motivations would not be much explored, as \"we just experience the results of these nefarious plans to replace us with themselves\".Although accepting the script, Spielberg asked for several changes. Spielberg had been against the idea of the aliens arriving in spaceships, since every alien invasion movie used such a vehicle. The original Martian cylinders were discarded, where Spielberg replaced the origins of the Tripods with stating they were buried underground in the Earth long ago.Spielberg had Miranda Otto in mind for the part of Mary Ann, but at the time he called her she was pregnant and thought the opportunity would be missed. Spielberg then decided to incorporate Otto\\'s pregnancy into the film, changing the part for her.\\nLawrence Brown wrote: \"Spielberg\\'s decision to present the invaders\\' fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which did not exist in the original Wells book. In Spielberg\\'s version, these invaders had been here before, long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself – a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers – and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us – all humans over the whole of history – have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be \\'harvested\\'\".\\n\\nFilming\\nFilming took place in Virginia, Connecticut, New Jersey, California, and New York. The film shooting lasted an estimated 72 days. Spielberg originally intended to shoot War of the Worlds after Munich, but Tom Cruise liked David Koepp\\'s script so much that he suggested Spielberg postpone the former while he would do the same with Mission: Impossible III. Most of Munich\\'s crew was brought in to work on War of the Worlds as well. In 2004, the production crews quickly were set up on both coasts to prepare for the start date, scouting locations up and down the Eastern Seaboard and preparing stages and sets which would be used when the company returned to Los Angeles after the winter holiday. Pre-production took place in only three months, essentially half the amount of time normally allotted for a film of similar size and scope. Spielberg notes, however, \"This wasn\\'t a cram course for War of the Worlds. This was my longest schedule in about 12 years. We took our time.\" Spielberg collaborated with crews at the beginning of pre-production with the use of previsualization, considering the tight schedule.The scene depicting the first appearance of the Tripods was filmed at the intersection of Ferry Street, Merchant Street, and Wilson Avenue, in Newark, New Jersey. Later, Spielberg filmed several scenes in Virginia. The continuous scene was filmed in California.The ferry scene was filmed in the New York town of Athens, and Mary Ann\\'s parents\\' house was located in Brooklyn (but was featured in the film in Boston). For the neighborhood plane crash scene, the production crew bought a retired Boeing 747 formerly operated by All Nippon Airways as JA8147, with transportation costs of $2 million, dismantled it into several pieces, and built houses around them. The destroyed plane was kept for the Universal Studios back-lot tour. Ray\\'s house was filmed in Bayonne, New Jersey (with a soundstage doubling the interior); meanwhile, the valley war sequence was filmed in Lexington, Virginia and Mystery Mesa in California. The scene where the tripod is shot down and crashes through a factory was filmed in Naugatuck, Connecticut at an abandoned chemical plant. The scene of the bodies floating down the river was filmed on the Farmington River in Windsor, Connecticut by a second unit using a stand in for Dakota Fanning shot from behind with the portion showing the faces of the credited actors cut in later. Some filming was shot on the Korean War Veterans Parkway in Staten Island, NY. The film used six sound stages, spread over three studio lots.Principal photography began on November 8, 2004 and wrapped on March 7, 2005.\\n\\nDesign and visual effects\\nIndustrial Light & Magic was the main special effects company for the movie. While Spielberg had used computers to help visualize sequences in pre-production before, Spielberg said, \"This is the first film I really tackled using the computer to animate all the storyboards.\" He decided to employ the technique extensively after a visit to his friend George Lucas. In order to keep the realism, the usage of computer-generated imagery shots and bluescreen was limited, with most of the digital effects being blended with miniature and live-action footage.The design of the Tripods was described by Spielberg as \"graceful,\" with artist Doug Chiang replicating aquatic life forms. At the same time, the director wanted a design that would be iconic while still providing a tribute to the original Tripods, as well as intimidating so the audience would not be more interested about the aliens inside than on the vehicle itself. The visual effects crew tried to blend organic and mechanical elements in the Tripods depiction, and made extensive studies for the movements of the vehicle to be believable, considering the \"contradiction\" of having a large tank-like head being carried by thin and flexible legs. Animator Randal M. Dutra considered the movements themselves to have a \"terrestrial buoyance\", in that they were walking on land but had an aquatic flow, and Spielberg described the Tripods as moving like \"scary ballet dancers\". Most of the alien elements revolved around the number three – the Tripod had three eyes, and both the vehicle and the aliens had three main limbs with three fingers each.Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman considered depicting the scale of the Tripod as challenging, considering \"Steven wanted to make sure that these creatures were 150 feet tall\", as it was the height described by Wells in the novel. The aliens themselves had designs based on jellyfish, with movements inspired by red-eyed tree frogs, and an amphibian quality particularly on the wet skin. A styrofoam alien was used as a stand-in to guide the actors in the basement scene. Spielberg did not want any blood or gore during the Heat-Ray deaths; in the words of Helman, \"this was going to be a horror movie for kids\". So the effects crew came up with the vaporization of the bodies, and considering it could not be fully digital due to both the complexity of the effect and the schedule, live-action dust was used alongside the CGI ray assimilation and particles. Digital birds followed the Tripods in most scenes to symbolize the presence of death, which Chiang compared to vultures and added that \"you don\\'t know if these birds are going to the danger or away from it, if you should follow them or run away.\"During the scene where Ray\\'s stolen minivan is attacked by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, flashlights and Maglights. The IL&M crew admitted that the destruction of the Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer. The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards the minivan and the minivan\\'s escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.Costume designer Joanna Johnston created 60 different versions of Ray\\'s leather jacket, to illustrate the degrees to which he is weathered from the beginning of the journey to the end. \"He begins with the jacket, a hoodie, and two t-shirts,\" explains Johnston. One piece of Dakota Fanning\\'s costume that takes on a special importance is her lavender horse purse: \"I wanted her to have something that made her feel safe, some little thing that she could sleep with and put over her face,\" Johnston notes. \"That was the lavender horse purse. We tied it up on a ribbon and Dakota hung it on her body, so it was with her at all times.\" Johnston dressed Robbie for an unconscious emulation of his father, \"They\\'re more alike than they realize, with great tension on the surface,\" Johnston says.\\n\\nMusic\\nLongtime Spielberg collaborator John Williams composed the music score of War of the Worlds. It was the first time Williams had to compose with an incomplete Spielberg film, as only the first six reels, totalling sixty minutes, were ready for him to use as reference. He considered the score \"a very serious piece,\" which had to combine \"necessary frightening atmosphere\" with \"propulsively rhythmic drive for the action scenes\" – the music would be symbolically \"pulling forward\" vehicles in chase scenes such as Ray driving out of Bayonne or the Tripod attacking the Hudson ferry. Williams added small nods to classic monster movie scores by having orchestras doing a \"grand gesture\" in scenes overlooking Tripods. To increase the scariness, Williams added a female chorus with a crescendo resembling a shriek – which would \"humanize\" the track representing \"victims that go out without saying an \\'ouch\\' – they\\'re gone before they can say that\" – for the Tripod attacks, and a nearly inaudible male choir – which Williams compared to \"Tibetan monks, the lowest known pitch our bodies can make\" – for the aliens exploring the basement. The only deviation from orchestras were electronic sounds for the opening and closing narrations.A soundtrack album was released by Decca Records, that featured the film\\'s music and Morgan Freeman\\'s opening and closing narration. The songs \"Little Deuce Coupe\" and \"Hushabye Mountain\" are also featured in the movie, the former sung by Tom Cruise, and the latter by Dakota Fanning.\\n\\nThemes\\nThe film was described as an anti-war film, as civilians run and only try to save themselves and their family instead of fighting back against the alien Tripods. Debra J. Saunders of San Francisco Chronicle described the film as \"If aliens invade, fight.\" Saunders compared the film to Independence Day, where the civilians do run, but they support the military efforts. Many reviewers considered the film tried to recreate the atmosphere of the September 11 attacks, with bystanders struggling to survive and the usage of missing-persons displays. Spielberg declared to Reader\\'s Digest that beside the work being a fantasy, the threat represented was real: \"They are a wake-up call to face our fears as we confront a force intent on destroying our way of life.\" Screenwriter David Koepp stated that he tried not to put explicit references to September 11 or the Iraq War, but said that the inspiration for the scene where Robbie joins the Marines was teenagers fighting in the Gaza Strip – \"I was thinking of teenagers in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks at tanks, and I think that when you\\'re that age you don\\'t fully consider the ramifications of what you\\'re doing and you\\'re very much caught up in the moment and passion, whether that\\'s a good idea or not.\"  Retained from the novel is the aliens being defeated, not by men\\'s weapons, but the planet\\'s smallest creatures, bacteria, which Koepp described as \"nature, in a way, knowing a whole lot more than we do\".\\n\\nRelease\\nWar of the Worlds premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre on June 23, 2005. There, Tom Cruise revealed his relationship with Katie Holmes. Six days later, on June 29, the film was released in approximately 3,908 theaters across America. The home video was subsequently released on November 22, 2005.\\n\\nSecrecy\\nSpielberg kept most of the parts secret in the filmmaking, as the cast and crew were left confused about how the aliens looked. When asked about the secrecy of the screenplay, David Koepp answered, \"[Spielberg] wouldn\\'t give [the screenplay] to anybody\". Koepp explained he would e-mail it to him, and he would give a section of the script that was relating to whatever somebody was doing. Miranda Otto thought of not even discussing the story with her family and friends. Otto said, \"I know some people who always say, \\'Oh, everything\\'s so secret.\\' I think it\\'s good. In the old days people didn\\'t get to know much about movies before they came out and nowadays there\\'s just so much information. I think a bit of mystery is always really good. You don\\'t want to blow all of your cards beforehand.\"Spielberg admitted after keeping things secret for so long, there is in the end the temptation to reveal too much to the detriment of the story at the press conference of War of the Worlds. So, Spielberg only revealed the hill scene, where Ray tries to stop his son from leaving, stating \"to say more would reveal too much.\" The actual budget of the film was $132 million.According to Vanity Fair, Spielberg\\'s relations with Cruise were \"poor\" during the film\\'s release because Spielberg believed Cruise\\'s \"antics\" at the time (such as an erratic appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show) had \"hurt\" the film and after a doctor whose name Spielberg had given to Cruise was picketed by Scientologists.\\n\\nMarketing and home media releases\\nParamount Pictures Interactive Marketing debuted a human survival online game on its official website, on April 14 to promote the film. Hitachi collaborated with Paramount Pictures for a worldwide promotional campaign, under the title of \"The Ultimate Visual Experience\". The agreement was announced by Kazuhiro Tachibana, general manager of Hitachi\\'s Consumer Business Group. Kazuhiro stated, \"Our \\'The Ultimate Visual Experience\\' campaign is a perfect match between Spielberg and Cruise\\'s pursuit of the world\\'s best in film entertainment and Hitachi\\'s commitment to the highest picture quality through its digital consumer electronic products.\"The film was released on VHS and DVD on November 22, 2005, with both a single-disc edition and a two-disc special edition which included production featurettes, documentaries and various trailers. The film grossed $113,000,000 in DVD sales, bringing its total film gross to $704,745,540, ranking tenth place in the 2005 DVD sales chart. Paramount released the film on Blu-ray Disc on June 1, 2010.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nOn June 29, 2005 (2005-06-29), the film grossed approximately US$81 million worldwide, and earned the thirty-eighth biggest opening week by grossing $98,826,764 in 3,908 theatres, averaging out to $25,288 in each theater. Meanwhile, on Independence Day weekend, War of the Worlds grossed $64,878,725 in 3908 theatres also, giving an average of $16,601. This is the third-biggest film opening on Independence Day weekend.  The film earned $200 million in 24 days, ranking thirty-seventh place in the list of fastest films to gross $200 million. The film has grossed $704,745,540 including DVD sales, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 2005, and the 66th highest-grossing film worldwide.\\n\\nCritical reaction\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, War of the Worlds holds a 75% approval rating based on 264 reviews and an average rating of 7.00/10. The critical consensus states: \"Steven Spielberg\\'s adaptation of War of the Worlds delivers on the thrill and paranoia of H.G. Wells\\' classic novel while impressively updating the action and effects for modern audiences.\" Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the film an average score of 73 out of 100 based on 40 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". On IMDb, the film has a rating of 6.6/10 stars based on reviews from Top 1000 voters.\\nJames Berardinelli praised the acting and considered that focusing the narrative on the struggle of one character made the film more effective, but described the ending as weak, even though Spielberg \"does the best he can to make it cinematically dramatic\". Total Film\\'s review gave War of the Worlds four out of five stars, considering that \"Spielberg finds fresh juice in a tale already adapted for film, TV, stage, radio and record\", and describing the film as having many \"startling images\", comparing the first Tripod attack to the Omaha Beach landing from Saving Private Ryan.Los Angeles Times\\' Kenneth Turan, who commended the film\\'s special effects, stated that Spielberg may actually have done his job in War of the Worlds \"better than he realizes\". Turan claimed that, by \"showing us how fragile our world is\", Spielberg raises a provocative question: \"Is the ultimate fantasy an invasion from outer space, or is it the survival of the human race?\" However, Broomfield Enterprise\\'s Dan Marcucci and Nancy Serougi did not share Berardinelli and Turan\\'s opinion. They felt that Morgan Freeman\\'s narration was unnecessary, and that the first half was \"great\" but the second half \"became filled with clichés, riddled with holes, and tainted by Tim Robbins\".Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing \"War of the Worlds definitely wins its battle, but not the war.\" Wilmington stated that the film \"takes [viewers] on a wild journey through two sides of [Spielberg]: the dark and the light.\" He also said the film contained a core sentiment similar to that of Spielberg\\'s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. About.com\\'s Rebecca Murray gave a positive review, stating, \"Spielberg almost succeeds in creating the perfect alien movie\", with criticism only for the ending. Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader praised the special effects and Cruise\\'s performance. Roger Ebert criticized the \"retro design\" and considered that despite the big budget, the alien invasion was \"rudimentary\" and \"not very interesting\", regarding the best scenes as Ray walking among the airliner wreckage and a train running in flames, declaring that \"such scenes seem to come from a kind of reality different from that of the tripods.\"The French film magazine Cahiers du cinéma ranked the film as 8th place in its list of best films of the 2000s. Japanese film director Kiyoshi Kurosawa listed the film as the best film of 2000–2009.\\n\\nAccolades\\nWar of the Worlds was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Visual Effects (Pablo Helman), Sound Mixing (Andy Nelson, Anna Behlmer and Ron Judkins), and Sound Editing, losing all to King Kong. The film was nominated for six Saturn Awards, and won Best Performance by a Younger Actor (Dakota Fanning). The film won a Golden Reel Award for Sound Effects & Foley, a World Soundtrack Award for Best Original Soundtrack, and three VES Awards for its special effects,  and was nominated for three Empire Awards, three Satellite Awards, and an MTV Movie Award.\\n\\nSee also\\nThe War of the Worlds, 1953 film\\nBook:War of the Worlds\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial Dreamworks website\\nWar of the Worlds at IMDb\\nWar of the Worlds at AllMovie\\nWar of the Worlds at Facebook\\nWar of the Worlds at the TCM Movie Database\\nWar of the Worlds at the American Film Institute Catalog\\nWar of the Worlds at Rotten Tomatoes\\nWar of the Worlds at Box Office Mojo\\nWar of the Worlds at Metacritic',\n",
              " 'Without Limits': 'Without Limits is a 1998 American biographical sports film. It is  written and directed by Robert Towne and follows the relationship between record-breaking distance runner Steve Prefontaine and his coach Bill Bowerman, who later co-founded Nike, Inc. Billy Crudup plays Prefontaine and Donald Sutherland plays Bowerman. It also stars Monica Potter, Jeremy Sisto, Judith Ivey, Matthew Lillard and William Mapother.\\nThe film was produced by Tom Cruise (Cruise and Mapother are cousins) and Paula Wagner, and released and distributed by Warner Bros. Due to a very low-key promotional campaign, the $25 million film grossed only $777,000 at the box office, although it received good reviews from many major critics. Sutherland received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the film.\\n\\nCast\\nBilly Crudup as Steve Prefontaine\\nDonald Sutherland as Bill Bowerman\\nMonica Potter as Mary Marckx\\nJeremy Sisto as Frank Shorter\\nJudith Ivey as Barbara Bowerman\\nDean Norris as Bill Dellinger\\nBilly Burke as Kenny Moore\\nFrank Shorter as Fred Long\\nMatthew Lillard as Roscoe Devine\\nWilliam Mapother as Bob Peters\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\n20 years prior the film\\'s release, Kenny Moore, a friend of late Steve Prefontaine, approached Robert Towne with the intention of making a film about Prefontaine but Towne was unavailable at the time. Three years later,  the two worked together on the film Personal Best and they again explored the idea. In 1994, the two met and Moore began writing a script for Towne to direct. Mary Marckx, Prefontaine\\'s former girlfriend and friend of Moore, gave Towne over 200 personal letters written by Prefontaine, which provided an insight into his thoughts and she also shared information on the relationship he had with his mother. Explaining how Tom Cruise got involved in the project, Moore said: Robert and I happened to be working on a project with Tom Cruise, who is also a runner and was training for a triathlon at that time. Robert showed him seven minutes of Fire on the Track, a documentary about Steve Prefontaine. Tom immediately loved the story and wanted to see it made as a dramatic feature.\\n\\nCasting\\nTowne originally envisioned Cruise in the role of Prefontaine, but it was decided he was too old. For the role, Billy Crudup who had been a college athlete trained for four months with Patrice Donnelly (she starred in Personal Best) to run short distances as he was expected to run 110 to 200 yards for a 5,000 meter race sequence. He also watched actual footage of Prefontaine to imitate his moves. Tommy Lee Jones, Harrison Ford and Clint Eastwood were considered for the part of Bowerman but they all turned it down and Donald Sutherland eventually landed the role. Monica Potter played the role of Prefontaine\\'s girlfriend and spent a lot of time with Mary Marckx to prepare for the part.\\n\\nFilming\\nThe film was shot on location in Oregon using the University of Oregon\\'s Hayward Field. Scenes were also filmed at Heceta Beach, Oregon. Bill Bowerman\\'s house served as a shooting location. After two months of filming in Oregon, the production moved to Los Angeles to film the Munich sequences at Citrus College. Some visuals of the Munich Olympics came from the documentary Visions of Eight: Because Disney wouldn\\'t let us use ABC\\'s coverage, we were stuck for footage of the race. But then we found, in the vault at Warner Bros., outtakes from [the 1972 Olympics documentary] Visions of Eight So we were very lucky because we found perfect, unexposed 35mm film of that race that had never been put into any other film. The result is that you have full shots of Munich stadium and shots of Steve waist-high that cut to Billy and back, and you can\\'t tell the difference.\\n\\nReception\\nWithout Limits met with positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 79% \"fresh\" approval rating with an average score of 6.6/10, based on 38 reviews. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"This drama about American track star and hero Steve Prefontaine intelligently looks at the character of this oft mythologized athlete and features a fantastic performance by Donald Sutherland as Prefontaine\\'s trainer.\"\\n\\nSee also\\nPrefontaine (film)\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nWithout Limits at IMDb'}"

            "The university first offered graduate degrees, in the form of a Master of Arts (MA), in the 1854–1855 academic year. The program expanded to include Master of Laws (LL.M.) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth, before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924 with formal requirements developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees. Today each of the five colleges offer graduate education. Most of the departments from the College of Arts and Letters offer PhD programs, while a professional Master of Divinity (M.Div.) program also exists. All of the departments in the College of Science offer PhD programs, except for the Department of Pre-Professional Studies. The School of Architecture offers a Master of Architecture, while each of the departments of the College of Engineering offer PhD programs. The College of Business offers multiple professional programs including MBA and Master of Science in Accountancy programs. It also operates facilities in Chicago and Cincinnati for its executive MBA program. Additionally, the Alliance for Catholic Education program offers a Master of Education program where students study at the university during the summer and teach in Catholic elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools across the Southern United States for two school years.\n",

It features Daniel Craig in his fourth performance as James Bond, and Christoph Waltz as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, with the film marking the character's re-introduction into the series. It was directed by Sam Mendes as his second James Bond film following Skyfall, and was written by John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth. It is distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures. With a budget around $245 million, it is the most expensive Bond film and one of the most expensive films ever made.\",\n",

Several recurring James Bond characters, including M, Q and Eve Moneypenny return, with the new additions of Léa Seydoux as Dr. Madeleine Swann, Dave Bautista as Mr. Hinx, Andrew Scott as Max Denbigh and Monica Bellucci as Lucia Sciarra.\",\n",

Bond infiltrates a Spectre meeting, where he identifies the leader, Franz Oberhauser. When Oberhauser addresses Bond by name, he escapes and is pursued by Mr. Hinx, a Spectre assassin. Moneypenny informs Bond that the information he collected leads to Mr. White, former member of Quantum, a subsidiary of Spectre. Bond asks her to investigate Oberhauser, who was presumed dead years earlier.\",\n",

It was released in the United States on 6 November 2015. It became the second James Bond film to be screened in IMAX venues after Skyfall, although it was not filmed with IMAX cameras. Spectre received mixed reviews upon its release; although criticised for its length, lack of screen time for new characters, and writing, it received praise for its action sequences and cinematography. The theme song, \"Writing\\'s on the Wall\", received mixed reviews, particularly compared to the previous theme; nevertheless, it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song and was nominated for the Academy Award in the same category.
