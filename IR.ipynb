              "{'A Few Good Men': 'A Few Good Men is a 1992 American legal drama film based on Aaron Sorkin\\'s 1989 play of the same name. Directed by Rob Reiner, who produced the film with David Brown and Andrew Scheinman was written from a screenplay by Sorkin himself and stars an ensemble cast, including Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, Kevin Pollak, J. T. Walsh, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Kiefer Sutherland. \\nThe film revolves around the court-martial of two U.S. Marines charged with the murder of a fellow Marine and the tribulations of their lawyers as they prepare a case to defend their clients.\\nProduced by Castle Rock Entertainment, the film was released by Columbia Pictures on December 11, 1992 and premiered on December 9, 1992 at Westwood. The film received universal acclaim for its screenwriting, direction, themes and acting (particuarly that of Cruise\\'s, Nicholson\\'s and Moore\\'s) and became a box office hit with grossing over $243 million against a budget of $40 million. \\nIn addition to its critical and commercial success, the film was nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Picture.\\n\\nPlot\\nU.S. Marines Lance Corporal Harold Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) and Private First Class Louden Downey (James Marshall) are facing a general court-martial, accused of murdering fellow Marine William Santiago at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Santiago had poor relations with his fellow Marines, compared unfavorably to them, and broke the chain of command in an attempt to get transferred out of Guantanamo. Base Commander Colonel Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson) and his officers argue about the best course of action: while Jessup\\'s executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson (J. T. Walsh), advocates that Santiago be transferred, Jessup dismisses the option and instead orders Santiago\\'s commanding officer, Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland), to \"train\" Santiago to become a better Marine.\\nWhile it is believed that the motive in Santiago\\'s murder was retribution for naming Dawson in a fenceline shooting, Naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) largely suspects Dawson and Downey carried out a \"code red\" order: a violent extrajudicial punishment. Galloway wants to defend the two, but the case is given to Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) – an inexperienced and unenthusiastic lawyer with a penchant for plea bargains. Galloway and Kaffee instantly conflict, with Galloway unsettled by Kaffee\\'s apparent laziness whilst Kaffee resents Galloway\\'s interference. Kaffee and Galloway travel to Guantanamo base Cuba to question Colonel Jessup and others.  Under questioning, Jessup claims Santiago was set to be transferred the next day.\\nWhen Kaffee negotiates a plea bargain with the prosecutor Captain Jack Ross, Dawson and Downey refuse to go along, insisting that Kendrick had indeed given them the \"code red\" order and that they never intended Santiago to die.  Dawson shows outright contempt for Kaffee, refusing to salute or acknowledge him as an officer because Dawson sees him as having no honor by choosing a plea bargain over defending their actions.  Lt. Col Markinson disappears. Kaffee plans to have himself removed as counsel as he sees going to trial as pointless.  At the arraignment, Kaffee unexpectedly enters a plea of not guilty, explaining to Galloway and Weinberg that he realized the reason he was chosen to handle this case was because it was expected he would accept a plea, and the matter would be kept quiet.\\nAfter the case begins, Markinson later reveals himself to Kaffee and states, unequivocally, that Jessup never ordered a transfer for William Santiago. The defense manages to establish that Cpl Dawson had been denied promotion for smuggling food to a Marine who had been sentenced to go without food, painting Dawson in a good light and proving \"code reds\" had been ordered before. However, the defense then suffer two major setbacks: Downey, under cross-examination, reveals he was not actually present when Dawson received the supposed \"code red\" order, and Markinson, after he tells Kaffee that Jessup never ordered the transfer, but, ashamed that he failed to protect a Marine under his command, commits suicide before he can testify.\\nWithout Markinson\\'s testimony, Kaffee believes the case lost. He later returns home in a drunken stupor, lamenting that he fought the case instead of taking a deal. Galloway encourages Kaffee to call Jessup as a witness, despite the risk of being court-martialed for smearing a high-ranking officer. Jessup spars evenly with Kaffee\\'s questioning, but is unnerved when Kaffee points out a contradiction in his testimony: Jessup stated his Marines never disobey orders and that Santiago was to be transferred for his own safety; if, Kaffee asks, Jessup ordered his men to leave Santiago alone, then how could Santiago be in danger? Irate at being caught in a lie and disgusted by what he sees as Kaffee\\'s impudence towards the Marines, Jessup extols the military\\'s importance, and his own, to national security. When asked point-blank if he ordered the \"code red\", Jessup continues with his self-important rant until, after repeatedly being asked the question, he bellows with contempt that, in fact, he did order the \"code red.\"  Jessup tries to leave the courtroom but is promptly arrested.\\nDawson and Downey are cleared of the murder and conspiracy charges, but found guilty of \"conduct unbecoming\" and ordered to be dishonorably discharged.  Dawson accepts the verdict, but Downey does not understand what they did wrong. Dawson explains that they had failed to defend those too weak to fight for themselves, like Santiago.  As the two are leaving, Kaffee tells Dawson that he does not need to wear a patch on his arm to have honor. Dawson sheds his previous contempt for Kaffee, acknowledges him as an officer, and renders a salute. The film ends with Kaffee and Ross exchanging kudos before Ross departs to arrest Kendrick.\\n\\nCast\\nCast notes:\\n\\nJoshua Malina is the only actor to reprise his role from the original Broadway production.\\nAaron Sorkin makes a cameo appearance as a lawyer bragging in a tavern\\n\\nProduction\\nScreenwriter Aaron Sorkin got the inspiration to write the source play, a courtroom drama called A Few Good Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah, who had graduated from Boston University Law School and signed up for a three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General\\'s Corps. She was going to Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre on Broadway. His roommates and he had purchased a Macintosh 512K, so when he returned home, he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.In 1988, Sorkin sold the film rights for his play to producer David Brown before it premiered, in a deal reportedly \"well into six figures\". Brown had read an article in The New York Times about Sorkin\\'s one-act play Hidden in This Picture, and he found out Sorkin also had a play called A Few Good Men that was having off-Broadway readings.William Goldman did an uncredited rewrite of the script that Sorkin liked so much, he incorporated the changes made into the stage version.Brown was producing a few projects at TriStar Pictures, and he tried to interest them in making A Few Good Men into a film, but his proposal was declined due to the lack of star-actor involvement. Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment, who was anxious to make the film. Rob Reiner, a producing partner at Castle Rock, opted to direct it.The film had a production budget of between $33 and 40 million.Nicholson would later comment on the $5 million he received for his role, \"It was one of the few times when it was money well spent.\"The film starts with a performance of \"Semper Fidelis\" by a U.S. Marine Corps marching band, and a Silent Drill performed by the Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets Fish Drill Team (portraying the United States Marine Corps Silent Drill Platoon).Several former Navy JAG lawyers have been identified as the basis for Tom Cruise\\'s character Lt. Kaffee. These include Don Marcari, now an attorney in Virginia; former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias; Chris Johnson, now practicing in California; and Walter Bansley III, now practicing in Connecticut.  However, in a September 15, 2011, article in The New York Times, Sorkin was quoted as saying, “The character of Dan Kaffee in A Few Good Men is entirely fictional and was not inspired by any particular individual.”Wolfgang Bodison was a film location scout when he was asked to take part in a screen test for the part of Dawson.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nThe film premiered at the Odeon Cinema, Manchester, England, and opened on December 11, 1992, in 1,925 theaters. It grossed $15,517,468 in its opening weekend and was the number-one film at the box office for the next three weeks. Overall, it grossed $141,340,178 in the U.S. and $101,900,000 internationally for a total of  $243,240,178.\\n\\nCritical response\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 7.09/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"An old-fashioned courtroom drama with a contemporary edge, A Few Good Men succeeds on the strength of its stars, with Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, and especially Jack Nicholson delivering powerful performances that more than compensate for the predictable plot.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service to earn the score.Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine said, \"That the performances are uniformly outstanding is a tribute to Rob Reiner (Misery), who directs with masterly assurance, fusing suspense and character to create a movie that literally vibrates with energy.\" Richard Schickel in Time magazine called it \"an extraordinarily well-made movie, which wastes no words or images in telling a conventional but compelling story.\" Todd McCarthy in Variety magazine predicted, \"The same histrionic fireworks that gripped theater audiences will prove even more compelling to filmgoers due to the star power and dramatic screw-tightening.\" Roger Ebert was less enthusiastic in the Chicago Sun-Times, giving it two-and-a-half out of four stars and finding its major flaw was revealing the courtroom strategy to the audience before the climactic scene between Cruise and Nicholson. Ebert wrote, \"In many ways this is a good film, with the potential to be even better than that. The flaws are mostly at the screenplay level; the film doesn\\'t make us work, doesn\\'t allow us to figure out things for ourselves, is afraid we\\'ll miss things if they\\'re not spelled out.\"Widescreenings noted that for Tom Cruise\\'s character Daniel Kaffee, \"Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun,\" where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a \"hotshot military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.\" Sorkin and Reiner are praised in gradually unveiling Kaffee\\'s potential in the film.\\n\\nHome media\\nA Few Good Men was released on VHS and Laserdisc by Columbia TriStar Home Video on June 30, 1993, and was released on DVD on October 7, 1997.

              " 'Aaron Sorkin': 'Aaron Benjamin Sorkin (born June 9, 1961) is an American screenwriter, director, producer, and playwright. Born in New York City, Sorkin developed a passion for writing at an early age. His works include the Broadway plays A Few Good Men, The Farnsworth Invention, and To Kill a Mockingbird; the television series Sports Night (1998–2000), The West Wing (1999–2006), Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (2006–07), and The Newsroom (2012–14). He wrote the film screenplay for the legal drama A Few Good Men (1992), the comedy The American President (1995), and several biopics including Charlie Wilson\\'s War (2007), Moneyball (2011), and Steve Jobs (2015). For writing 2010\\'s The Social Network, he won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay.\\nHe made his feature film debut as a director in 2017 with the crime drama Molly\\'s Game, which garnered mostly positive reviews and earned him a third Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. As a writer, Sorkin is recognized for his trademark fast-paced dialogue and extended monologues, complemented by frequent collaborator Thomas Schlamme\\'s storytelling technique called the \"walk and talk\". These sequences consist of single tracking shots of long duration involving multiple characters engaging in conversation as they move through the set; characters enter and exit the conversation as the shot continues without any cuts.\\n\\nEarly life\\nSorkin was born in Manhattan, New York City, to a Jewish family, and was raised in the New York suburb of Scarsdale. His mother was a schoolteacher and his father a copyright lawyer who had fought in WWII and put himself through college on the G.I. Bill; both his older sister and brother went on to become lawyers. His paternal grandfather was one of the founders of the International Ladies\\' Garment Workers\\' Union (ILGWU). Sorkin took an early interest in acting. During childhood, his parents took him to the theatre to see shows such as Who\\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and That Championship Season.Sorkin attended Scarsdale High School where he became involved in the drama and theatre club. In the eighth grade, he played General Bullmoose in the musical Li\\'l Abner. At Scarsdale High, he served as vice president of the drama club in his junior and senior years, and graduated in 1979.In 1979, Sorkin attended Syracuse University. In his freshman year, he failed a class that was a core requirement, which caused a setback because he wanted to be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed the core classes. Determined to do better, he returned for his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Musical Theatre. Recalling the influence of theatre teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin said: \"Arthur\\'s reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of us went to S.U. [Syracuse University]... \\'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are\\', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, \\'How?\\', and he answered, \\'Dare to fail\\'. I\\'ve been coming through on his admonition ever since\".\\n\\nCareer\\n1983–1990: Early work and breakthrough\\nSorkin moved to New York City where he spent much of the 1980s as a struggling, sporadically-employed actor who worked odd jobs, such as delivering singing telegrams, driving a limousine, touring Alabama with the children\\'s theatre company Traveling Playhouse, handing out fliers promoting a hunting-and-fishing show, and bartending at Broadway\\'s Palace Theatre. One weekend, while house-sitting for a friend, he found an IBM Selectric typewriter, started typing, and \"felt a phenomenal confidence and a kind of joy that [he] had never experienced before in [his] life.\"He continued writing and eventually put together his first play, Removing All Doubt, which he sent to his former theatre teacher, Arthur Storch, who was impressed. In 1984, Removing All Doubt was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University. After that, he wrote Hidden in This Picture which debuted off-off-Broadway at Steve Olsen\\'s West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in New York City in 1988. The quality of his first two plays earned him a theatrical agent. Producer John A. McQuiggan saw the production of Hidden in This Picture and commissioned Sorkin to turn the one-act into a full-length play called Making Movies.Sorkin was inspired to write his next play, a courtroom drama called A Few Good Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah, who had graduated from Boston University Law School and signed up for a three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General\\'s Corps. Deborah told Sorkin that she was going to Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K; when he returned home, he would transcribe the story and notes onto the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.In 1988, Sorkin sold the film rights for A Few Good Men to producer David Brown before it premiered, in a deal that was reportedly \"well into six figures\". Brown had read an article in The New York Times about Sorkin\\'s one-act play Hidden in This Picture, and found out Sorkin had a play called A Few Good Men that was having Off Broadway readings. Brown produced A Few Good Men on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre. It starred Tom Hulce and was directed by Don Scardino. After opening in late 1989, it ran for 497 performances. Sorkin continued writing Making Movies and in 1990 it debuted Off-Broadway at the Promenade Theatre, produced by John A. McQuiggan, and again directed by Don Scardino. Meanwhile, Brown was producing for TriStar Pictures, and tried to interest them in adapting A Few Good Men into a film, but his proposal was declined due to the lack of star actor involvement. Brown later received a phone call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment who was anxious to make the film. Rob Reiner, a Castle Rock producing partner, opted to direct.\\n\\n1991–1997: Writing for Castle Rock Entertainment\\nSorkin worked under contract for Castle Rock Entertainment, where he befriended colleagues William Goldman and Rob Reiner, and met his future wife Julia Bingham, who was one of Castle Rock\\'s business affairs lawyers. Sorkin wrote several drafts of the script for A Few Good Men in his Manhattan apartment, learning the craft from a book about screenplay format. He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with director Rob Reiner. William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stage play into a screenplay. The film, directed by Reiner, starred Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by Brown. A Few Good Men was released in 1992 and was a box office success, grossing $243 million worldwide.Goldman also approached Sorkin with a story premise, which Sorkin developed into the script for the thriller Malice. Goldman oversaw the project as creative consultant while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts. However, he had to leave the project to finish the script for A Few Good Men, so screenwriter Scott Frank stepped in and wrote two drafts of the Malice screenplay. When production on A Few Good Men was completed, Sorkin resumed working on Malice right through the final shooting script. Harold Becker directed the 1993 thriller, which starred Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin. Malice had mixed reviews; Vincent Canby in The New York Times described the film as \"deviously entertaining from its start through its finish\". Critic Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4 stars, and Peter Travers in a 2000 Rolling Stone review summarized it as having \"suspense but no staying power\".Sorkin\\'s last screenplay under Castle Rock was The American President; once again he worked with William Goldman who served as a creative consultant. It took Sorkin several years to write the screenplay for The American President, which started off at 385-pages; it was eventually reduced to a standard shooting script of around 120 pages. The film, also directed by Reiner, was critically acclaimed; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described it as \"genial and entertaining if not notably inspired\", and believed its most interesting aspects were the \"pipe dreams about the American political system and where it could theoretically be headed\". A Few Good Men, Malice and The American President grossed approximately $400 million worldwide.In the second half of the 1990s, Sorkin worked as a script doctor. He wrote some quips for Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage in 1996\\'s The Rock. He worked on Excess Baggage, a 1997 comedy about a girl who stages her own kidnapping to get her father\\'s attention, and rewrote some of Will Smith\\'s scenes in Enemy of the State. Sorkin collaborated with Warren Beatty on several scripts, one of which was 1998\\'s Bulworth. Beatty, known for occasionally personally financing his film projects through pre-production, also hired Sorkin to rewrite a script titled Ocean of Storms which never went into production. At one point, Sorkin sued Beatty for proper compensation for his work on the Ocean of Storms script; once the matter was settled, he resumed working on the script.\\n\\n1998–2006: Television series and theatre work\\nSports Night\\nSorkin conceived the idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while residing at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the screenplay for The American President. He would work late, with the television tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a television comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the ABC network in fall of 1998.Sorkin fought with ABC during the first season over the use of a laugh track and a live studio audience. The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of Salon magazine describing it as \"the most unconvincing laugh track you\\'ve ever heard\". Sorkin commented that: \"Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you have no choice but to use the laugh track. Oftentimes [enhancing the laughs] is the right thing to do. Sometimes you do need a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me.\" The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was removed by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse. Although Sports Night was critically acclaimed, ABC canceled the show after two seasons due to low ratings. Sorkin entertained offers to continue the show on other television channels, but declined all the offers because they were dependent on his involvement and he was already working on The West Wing.\\n\\nThe West Wing\\nSorkin conceived the political drama The West Wing in 1997 when he went unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells; in a panic he pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for The American President. He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President, and they found themselves discussing public service and the passion of the people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to NBC, but was told to wait due to the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. There was a concern that television audiences would not be able to take a series about the White House seriously. A year later, other networks started showing interest in The West Wing. NBC decided to give the project the green-light despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.The West Wing garnered nine Primetime Emmy Awards for its debut season, making the series a record holder for most Emmys won by a series in a single season at the time. Following the awards ceremony, there was a dispute about the acceptance speech for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. The West Wing episode \"In Excelsis Deo\" won, which was awarded to Sorkin and Rick Cleveland, but The New York Times reported that Sorkin ushered Cleveland off the stage before he could say a few words. The story behind \"In Excelsis Deo\" is based on Cleveland\\'s father, a Korean War veteran who spent the last years of his life on the street, as Cleveland explained in an essay titled \"I Was the Dumb Looking Guy with the Wire-Rimmed Glasses\". Sorkin and Cleveland continued their dispute in a public web forum at Mighty Big TV in which Sorkin explained that he gives his writers \"Story By\" credit on a rotating basis \"by way of a gratuity\" and that he had thrown out Cleveland\\'s script and started from scratch. Sorkin eventually apologized to Cleveland. Cleveland and Sorkin also won the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Drama at the 53rd Writer Guild of America Awards for \"In Excelsis Deo\".In 2001, after completing the second season of The West Wing, Sorkin suffered a drug relapse, and was arrested at Hollywood Burbank Airport for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine. He was ordered by a court to attend a drug diversion program. There was huge media interest but he did make a successful recovery. In 2002, Sorkin criticized NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw\\'s television special about a day in the life of a president, \"The Bush White House: Inside the Real West Wing\", comparing it to the act of sending a valentine to President George W. Bush instead of real news reporting. The West Wing aired on the same network, and so at the request of NBC\\'s Entertainment President Jeff Zucker, Sorkin apologized, but later said, \"there should be a difference between what NBC News does and what The West Wing TV series does.\"Sorkin wrote 87 screenplays for The West Wing, which is nearly every episode during the show\\'s first four Emmy-winning seasons. Sorkin described his role in the creative process as \"not so much [that of] a showrunner or a producer. I\\'m really a writer.\" He admitted that this approach can have its drawbacks, saying \"Out of 88 [West Wing] episodes that I did we were on time and on budget never, not once.\" In 2003, at the end of the fourth season, Sorkin and fellow executive producer Thomas Schlamme left the show due to internal conflicts at Warner Bros. Television, causing John Wells to serve as showrunner. Sorkin never watched any episodes beyond his writing tenure apart from a minute of the fifth season\\'s first episode, describing the experience as \"like watching somebody make out with my girlfriend.\" Sorkin later returned in the series finale for a cameo appearance as a member of President Bartlet\\'s staff.\\n\\nStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip\\nIn 2005, Sorkin returned to theatre; he revised his play A Few Good Men for a production at London\\'s West End. The play opened at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in the fall of the same year and was directed by David Esbjornson, with Rob Lowe of The West Wing in the lead role. Sorkin told The Charlie Rose Show that he was developing a television series based on a late-night sketch comedy show similar to Saturday Night Live. In October 2005, a pilot script dubbed Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip, written by him and Schlamme as producer, started circulating in Hollywood and online. In that same month, NBC bought the rights from Warner Bros. Television to air the series on their network for a near-record license fee after a bidding war with CBS. The show\\'s name was later changed to Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Sorkin described the show as having \"autobiographical elements\" to it and \"characters that are based on actual people\" but said that it departs from those beginnings to look at the backstage maneuverings at a late night sketch comedy show.On September 18, 2006, the pilot for Studio 60 aired on NBC, directed by Schlamme. The pilot was critically acclaimed and viewed by an audience of over 12 million, but the show experienced a significant drop in viewership mid-season. Even before the first episode aired, there was a large amount of thoughtful and scrupulous criticism in the press, as well as negative analysis from bloggers. In January 2007, Sorkin spoke out against the press for reporting heavily on the low ratings, and for using blogs and unemployed comedy writers as sources. After two months hiatus, Studio 60 resumed airing the last episodes of season one, which would be its only season.\\n\\nThe Farnsworth Invention\\nAs early as 2003, Sorkin was writing a spec script about inventor Philo Farnsworth; he was approached by producer Fred Zollo in the 1990s about adapting Elma Farnsworth\\'s memoir into a biographical film. The following year, he completed the film screenplay, The Farnsworth Invention, which was acquired by New Line Cinema with Schlamme as director. The story is about the patent battle between Farnsworth and RCA tycoon David Sarnoff for the technology that allowed the first television transmissions in the United States. No additional details were released about the film. Shortly, Sorkin was contacted by Jocelyn Clarke of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, requesting he write a play for them, a commission which he accepted. Sorkin decided to rewrite The Farnsworth Invention as a play. He delivered a first draft of the play to the Abbey Theatre in early 2005, and a production was planned for 2007 with La Jolla Playhouse deciding to stage a workshop production of the play in collaboration with the Abbey Theatre. In 2006, Abbey Theatre\\'s new management quit involvement with The Farnsworth Invention. Despite this, La Jolla Playhouse carried on with Steven Spielberg serving as a producer. The production opened under La Jolla\\'s signature Page To Stage program which allowed Sorkin and director Des McAnuff to develop the play from show-to-show according to audience reactions and feedback; the play ran from February 20, 2007 through March 25, 2007. A Broadway production followed soon after, beginning in previews, and opening on November 14, 2007; however, the play was delayed by the 2007 Broadway stagehand strike. The Farnsworth Invention eventually opened at the Music Box Theatre on December 3, 2007, and closed on March 2, 2008.\\n\\n2007–2015: Return to film and The Newsroom\\nIn 2007, Sorkin was commissioned by Universal Pictures to adapt George Crile\\'s non-fiction book Charlie Wilson\\'s War for Tom Hanks\\' production company Playtone. The biographical comedy, Charlie Wilson\\'s War, is about the colorful Texas congressman Charlie Wilson who funded the CIA\\'s secret war against the former Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Directed by Mike Nichols, and written by Sorkin, the film was released in 2007 and starred Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film earned five nominations at the Golden Globes, including Best Screenplay for Sorkin.In August 2008, Sorkin announced that he had agreed to write a script for Sony Pictures and producer Scott Rudin about the beginnings of Facebook. David Fincher\\'s The Social Network, based on Ben Mezrich\\'s novel The Accidental Billionaires, was released on October 1, 2010. It was a critical and commercial success; Sorkin won an Academy Award, BAFTA and a Golden Globe for the screenplay. A year later, Sorkin received nominations in the same award categories for co-writing Moneyball. It is based on Michael Lewis\\'s 2003 non-fiction book of the same name, an account of the Oakland Athletics baseball team\\'s 2002 season and their general manager Billy Beane\\'s attempts to assemble a competitive team. The film was directed by Bennett Miller, and starred Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the script \"dynamite\", in which Sorkin\\'s \"sharply witty touch is everywhere\".\\nIn 2011, Sorkin played himself on the series 30 Rock, episode \"Plan B\", where he did a \"walk and talk\" with Liz Lemon played by Tina Fey. While still working on the screenplay for The Social Network, Sorkin was contemplating a television drama about the behind-the-scenes events at a cable news program. Talks had been ongoing between Sorkin and HBO since 2010. To research the news industry, Sorkin observed the production crew at MSNBC\\'s Countdown with Keith Olbermann, and quizzed Parker Spitzer\\'s staff. He also spent time shadowing Hardball with Chris Matthews, as well as other programs on Fox News and CNN. Sorkin told TV Guide that he intended to take a less cynical view of the media: \"They\\'re going to be trying to do well in a context where it\\'s very difficult to do well when there are commercial concerns and political concerns and corporate concerns.\" Sorkin decided that rather than have his characters react to fictional news events as on his earlier series, it would be set in the recent past and track real-world stories largely as they unfolded, to give a greater sense of realism.\\nHBO ordered a pilot episode in January 2011 with the working title More as This Story Develops, with Scott Rudin serving as an executive producer. In September, HBO ordered a 10-episode series of The Newsroom with a premiere date of June 2012. A day after the second episode aired, HBO renewed the series for a second season. Sorkin said The Newsroom \"is meant to be an idealistic, romantic, swashbuckling, sometimes comedic but very optimistic, upward-looking look at a group of people who are often looked at cynically. The same as with The West Wing, where ordinarily in popular culture our leaders are portrayed either as Machiavellian or dumb; I wanted to do something different and show a highly competent group of people.\" The series concluded after its third season.\\nIn 2015, Danny Boyle\\'s biographical drama Steve Jobs was released. The screenplay by Sorkin was based on Walter Isaacson\\'s biography of Steve Jobs, and starred Michael Fassbender as Jobs, Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, Jeff Daniels as John Sculley, and Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak.  Sorkin expressed hesitation for tackling the film, saying \"it was a little like writing about the Beatles—that there are so many people out there who know so much about him [Jobs] and who revere him that I just saw a minefield of disappointment.  [...] Hopefully, when I\\'m done with my research, I\\'ll be in the same ball park of knowledge about Steve Jobs\". He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, although some journalists were surprised that he did not receive an Academy Award nomination in the same category. While the critic from South China Morning Post thought it was the best-written film of the year, Ashley Clark of Little White Lies magazine criticized the script for its \"overly verbose dialogue\".\\n\\n2016–present: Venture into directing\\nIn February 2016, it was announced that Sorkin would adapt Harper Lee\\'s To Kill a Mockingbird for the stage, and work alongside Bartlett Sher. His Broadway adaptation opened on December 13, 2018 to positive reviews at the Shubert Theatre. Next, Sorkin made his directorial debut with Molly\\'s Game, an adaptation of entrepreneur Molly Bloom\\'s memoir. He also wrote the script for it, which starred Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba. Production began in 2016 and the film was released in December 2017 to mostly positive reviews; Sorkin received his third Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Molly\\'s Game garnered an approval rating of 81% based on 297 reviews, with an average rating of 7.07/10.Sorkin told Vanity Fair in July 2020 that Steven Spielberg offered him a job in 2006 about \"a movie about the riots at the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention and the trial that followed.\" However, after meeting at Spielberg\\'s home, Sorkin said, \"I left not knowing what the hell he was talking about.\" On July 12, 2007, Variety magazine reported that Sorkin had signed a deal with DreamWorks to write three scripts. The first was The Trial of the Chicago 7, which Sorkin was already developing with Spielberg, and Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. In March 2010, Sorkin\\'s agent, Ari Emanuel, had stated that the project was proving \"tough to get together.\" In late July 2013, it was announced that Paul Greengrass would be directing, but Sorkin eventually both wrote and directed the film. Focusing on the Chicago Seven (and Bobby Seale), the film began a limited release on September 25, 2020, before streaming on Netflix. At the Golden Globes, Sorkin received his eighth nomination (and third win) for Best Screenplay, and his first nomination for Best Director.\\n\\nProspective projects\\nIn March 2007, it was reported that Sorkin had signed on to write a musical adaptation of the hit 2002 record Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots by psychedelic-rock band The Flaming Lips, collaborating with director Des McAnuff who had been developing the project. In August 2008, McAnuff announced that Sorkin had been commissioned by the Stratford Shakespeare Festival to write an adaptation of Chekhov\\'s The Cherry Orchard. In 2010, Sorkin reportedly obtained the film rights to Andrew Young\\'s book The Politician (about Senator John Edwards), and announced that he would make his debut as a film director while adapting the book for the screen.In November 2010, it was reported that Sorkin will write a musical based on the life of Houdini, with music by Danny Elfman. In January 2012, Stephen Schwartz was reported to be writing the music and lyrics, with Sorkin making his debut as a librettist. The musical was expected for release in 2013–14; Sorkin said: \"The chance to collaborate with Stephen Schwartz [the director], Jack O\\'Brien, and Hugh Jackman on a new Broadway musical is a huge gift.\" In January 2013, he quit the project, citing film and television commitments.In September 2015, Entertainment Weekly reported that Sorkin was writing a biopic that will focus on the twenty-year marriage of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz and their work together on I Love Lucy and The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour. Cate Blanchett was originally to star as Ball. In 2017, Amazon Studios acquired the rights to the film. In January 2021, it was announced that Blanchett has been replaced by Nicole Kidman, and Javier Bardem has been cast as Desi Arnaz.In March 2016, it was announced that Sorkin would adapt A Few Good Men for a live production on NBC, originally slated to air in 2017; as of November 2017, \"Sorkin is still mulling the project\".\\n\\nWriting process and style\\nSorkin has written for the theatre, film and television, and in each medium his level of collaboration with other creators has varied. He began in theatre which involved a largely solitary writing process, then moved into film where he collaborated with director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, and eventually worked in television where he collaborated very closely with director Thomas Schlamme for nearly a decade on the shows Sports Night, The West Wing and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip; he now moves between all three media. He has a habit of chain smoking while he spends countless hours cooped up in his office plotting out his next scripts. He describes his writing process as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing.\\nA New York Times article by Peter de Jonge explained that \"The West Wing is never plotted out for more than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines\", which De Jonge believed was because \"with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs\". Sorkin has stated: \"I seldom plan ahead, not because I don\\'t think it\\'s good to plan ahead, there just isn\\'t time.\" Sorkin has also said, \"As a writer, I don\\'t like to answer questions until the very moment that I have to.\" The Seattle Post-Intelligencer\\'s TV critic John Levesque has commented that Sorkin\\'s writing process \"can make for ill-advised plot developments\". Further complicating the matter, in television, Sorkin will have a hand in writing every episode, rarely letting other writers earn full credit on a script. de Jonge reported that ex-writers of The West Wing have claimed that \"even by the spotlight-hogging standards of Hollywood, Sorkin has been exceptionally ungenerous in his sharing of writing credit\". In a comment to GQ magazine in 2008, Sorkin said, \"I\\'m helped by a staff of people who have great ideas, but the scripts aren\\'t written by committee.\"Sorkin\\'s long-term collaboration with Schlamme began in early 1998 when they found they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced Sports Night. Their successful partnership in television is one in which Sorkin focuses on writing the scripts while Schlamme executive produces and occasionally directs; they have worked together on Sports Night, The West Wing, and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing. In response to what he perceived as unfair criticism of The Newsroom, Jacob Drum of Digital Americana wrote, \"The essential truth that the critics miss is that The Newsroom is Sorkin being Sorkin as he always has been and always will be: one part pioneer; one part self-conscious romantic; two parts actual Lewis & Clark-style pioneer, trapping his way across an old, old idea of an America that can always stand to raise its game—but most importantly, spinning a good yarn while he does so.\"\\nFor me, the writing experience is very much like a date. It\\'s not unusual that I\\'m really funny here and really smart here and maybe showing some anger over here so she sees maybe I have this dark side. I want it to have been worth it for everyone to sit through it for however long I ask them to.\\nSorkin is known for writing memorable lines and fast-paced dialogue, such as \"You can\\'t handle the truth!\" from A Few Good Men and the partly Latin tirade against God in The West Wing episode \"Two Cathedrals\". For television, one hallmark of Sorkin\\'s writer\\'s voice is the repartee that his characters engage in as they small talk and banter about whimsical events taking place within an episode, and interject obscure popular culture references into conversation. Although his scripts are lauded for being literate, Sorkin has been criticized for often turning in scripts that are overwrought. His mentor William Goldman has commented that normally in visual media speeches are avoided, but that Sorkin has a talent for dialogue and gets away with breaking this rule.In August 2016, Sorkin launched a screenwriting course on MasterClass. The course includes dialogue, character development, story pacing, plot, and his process of working. Students can watch videos, download workbooks, and share their observations and progress through discussion boards and social media groups.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nSorkin married Julia Bingham in 1996 and divorced in 2005, with his workaholic habits and drug abuse reported to be a partial cause. Sorkin and Bingham have one daughter, Roxy. He dated Kristin Chenoweth for several years, who played Annabeth Schott on The West Wing (after Sorkin had left the show). He has also reportedly dated columnist Maureen Dowd and actress Kristin Davis.A consistent supporter of the Democratic Party, Sorkin has made substantial political campaign contributions to candidates between 1999 and 2011, according to CampaignMoney.com. During the 2004 US presidential election campaign, the liberal advocacy group MoveOn\\'s political action committee enlisted Sorkin and Rob Reiner to create one of their anti-Bush campaign advertisements. In August 2008, Sorkin was involved in a Generation Obama event at the Fine Arts Theater in Beverly Hills, California, participating in a panel discussion subsequent to a screening of Frank Capra\\'s Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. However, Sorkin does not consider himself a political activist: \"I\\'ve met political activists, and they\\'re for real. I\\'ve never marched anyplace or done anything that takes more effort than writing a check in terms of activism\". In 2016, after President Donald Trump won the election, Sorkin wrote an open letter to his daughter Roxy and her mother Julia.In 1987, Sorkin started using marijuana and cocaine. He said the drug gave him relief from certain nervous tensions that occur on a regular basis. In 1995, he sought rehabilitation at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, on the advice of Bingham to combat his addiction. In early 2001, Sorkin and his colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for overcoming their drug abuse. However, on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when security guards at Hollywood Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag, and a metal crack pipe was detected by a magnetometer. He was court-ordered to a drug diversion program, but continued working on The West Wing during the time. In a commencement speech for Syracuse University on May 13, 2012, Sorkin said he has not used cocaine for eleven years.\\n\\nFilmography\\nFilms\\nTelevision\\nPlays\\nActing credits\\nAwards and nominations\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nAaron Sorkin (July 2002).

              " 'Academy Award for Best Picture': 'The Academy Award for Best Picture is one of the Academy Awards presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) since the awards debuted in 1929. This award goes to the producers of the film and is the only category in which every member of the Academy is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot. Best Picture is the final award of the night and is considered the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.The Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award\\'s inception. There have been 563 films nominated for Best Picture and 92 winners.\\n\\nHistory\\nCategory name changes\\nAt the 1st Academy Awards ceremony (for 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: Outstanding Picture and Unique and Artistic Picture, the former being won by the war epic Wings, and the latter by the art film Sunrise. Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking.\\nThe following year, the Academy dropped the Unique and Artistic Picture award, and decided retroactively that the award won by Wings was the highest honor that could be awarded. Although the award kept the title Outstanding Picture for the next ceremony, the name underwent several changes over the years as seen below. Since 1962, the award has been simply called Best Picture.\\n1927/28–1928/29: Academy Award for Outstanding Picture\\n1929/30–1940: Academy Award for Outstanding Production\\n1941–1943: Academy Award for Outstanding Motion Picture\\n1944–1961: Academy Award for Best Motion Picture\\n1962–present: Academy Award for Best Picture\\n\\nRecipients\\nUntil 1950, this award was presented to a representative of the production company. That year the protocol was changed so that the award was presented to all credited producers. This rule was modified in 1999 to apply a maximum limit of three producers receiving the award, after the five producers of Shakespeare in Love had received the award.As of 2020, the \"Special Rules for the Best Picture of the Year Award\" limit recipients to those who meet two main requirements:\\nThose with screen credit of \"producer\" or \"produced by\", explicitly excluding those with the screen credit \"executive producer, co-producer, associate producer, line producer, or produced in association with\"\\nthose three or fewer producers who have performed the major portion of the producing functionsThe rules allow bona fide team of not more than two people shall be considered to be a single “producer” if the two individuals have had an established producing partnership as determined by the Producers Guild of America Producing Partnership Panel. Final determination of the qualifying producer nominees for each nominated picture will be made by the Producers Branch Executive Committee, including the right to name any additional qualified producer as a nominee.The Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously included among the four producers nominated for The Reader. As of 2014 the Producers Branch Executive Committee determines such exceptions, noting they take place only in \"rare and extraordinary circumstance[s].\"Steven Spielberg currently holds the record for most nominations at ten, winning one, while Kathleen Kennedy holds the record for most nominations without a win at eight. Sam Spiegel and Saul Zaentz tie for the most wins with three each. As for the time when the Oscar was given to production companies instead, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer holds the record with five wins and 40 nominations.\\n\\nBest Picture and Best Director\\nThe Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director have been closely linked throughout their history. Of the 92 films that have won Best Picture, 66 have also been awarded Best Director. Only five films have been awarded Best Picture without receiving a Best Director nomination: Wings (1927/28), Grand Hotel (1931/32), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), Argo (2012), and Green Book (2018). The only two Best Director winners to win for films that did not receive a Best Picture nomination were during the early years of the awards: Lewis Milestone for Two Arabian Knights (1927/28), and Frank Lloyd for The Divine Lady (1928/29).\\n\\nNomination limit increased\\nOn June 24, 2009, AMPAS announced that the number of films to be nominated in the Best Picture award category would increase from five to ten, starting with the 82nd Academy Awards (2009). Although the Academy never officially said so, many commenters noted the expansion was likely in part a response to public criticism of The Dark Knight (2008) (and, in previous years, other blockbusters and popular films) not being nominated for Best Picture. Officially, the Academy said the rule change was a throwback to the Academy\\'s early years in the 1930s and 1940s, when eight to 12 films were nominated each year. \"Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize,\" AMPAS President Sid Ganis said in a press conference. \"I can\\'t wait to see what that list of 10 looks like when the nominees are announced in February.\"At the same time, the voting system was switched from first-past-the-post to instant runoff voting (also known as preferential voting). Two years after this change, the Academy revised the rule again so that the number of films nominated was between five and ten; nominated films must earn either 5% of first-place rankings or 5% after an abbreviated variation of the single transferable vote nominating process. Bruce Davis, the Academy executive director at the time, said, \"A Best Picture nomination should be an indication of extraordinary merit. If there are only eight pictures that truly earn that honor in a given year, we shouldn\\'t feel an obligation to round out the number.\"\\n\\nLanguage and country of origin\\nOnly eleven non-English language films have been nominated in the category: La Grande Illusion (French, 1938); Z (French, 1969); The Emigrants (Swedish, 1972); Cries and Whispers (Swedish, 1973); The Postman (Il Postino) (Italian/Spanish, 1995); Life Is Beautiful (Italian, 1998); Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Mandarin Chinese, 2000); Letters from Iwo Jima (Japanese, 2006, but ineligible for Best Foreign Language Film, as it was an American production); Amour (French, 2012); Roma (Spanish/Mixtec, 2018); and Parasite (Korean, 2019). Parasite became the first film not in English to win Best Picture.Only ten films wholly financed outside the United States have won Best Picture, eight of which were financed, in part or in whole, by the United Kingdom: Hamlet (1948), Tom Jones (1963), A Man for All Seasons (1966), Chariots of Fire (1981), Gandhi (1982), The Last Emperor (1987), Slumdog Millionaire (2008), and The King\\'s Speech (2010). The ninth film, The Artist (2011), was financed by France and the tenth film, Parasite (2019), was financed by South Korea.\\n\\nGenres\\nSome genres of film (or mediums in the case of an animation) have received few or no nominations or awards. Only three animated films have been nominated — Beauty and the Beast (1991), Up (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010). The latter two were nominated after the Academy expanded the number of nominees, but none have won. No comic book or superhero film has won, and only two have ever been nominated — Black Panther (2018), and Joker (2019).  Only two fantasy films have won — The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) and The Shape of Water (2017), although more have been nominated. The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is the only horror film to win Best Picture, and only five others have been nominated for Best Picture: The Exorcist (1973), Jaws (1975), The Sixth Sense (1999), Black Swan (2010), and Get Out (2017). No science fiction film has won the award, though eleven films have been nominated: A Clockwork Orange, Star Wars, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Avatar, District 9, Inception, Gravity, Her, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Martian, and Arrival.\\nNo documentary feature has yet been nominated for Best Picture, although Chang was nominated in the \"Unique and Artistic Production\" category at the 1927/28 awards.\\nSeveral musical adaptations based on material previously filmed in non-musical form have won Best Picture, including Gigi, West Side Story, My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oliver!, and Chicago.\\n\\nSequel nominations and winners\\nFew sequels have been nominated for Best Picture and just two have won: The Godfather Part II (the film before that, The Godfather, also won the award; the third film in the installment The Godfather Part III, was nominated as well but did not win the award) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (the films before that, Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers were both nominated for the award but did not win). Other nominees include The Bells of St. Mary\\'s (the sequel to the 1944 winner, Going My Way), Toy Story 3, and Mad Max: Fury Road.Another nominee, Broadway Melody of 1936, was a follow-up of sorts to previous winner The Broadway Melody. But, beyond the title and some music, there is no story connection to the earlier film. The Silence of the Lambs was adapted from the sequel novel to Red Dragon. The latter had been adapted for film as Manhunter by a different studio. Best Picture nominee The Lion in Winter features Peter O\\'Toole as King Henry II, a role he had played previously in the film Becket. But Winter is not a sequel to Becket. Clint Eastwood\\'s Letters from Iwo Jima was a companion piece to his film Flags of Our Fathers, released earlier the same year. These two films depict the same battle from the different viewpoints of Japanese and United States military forces; the two films were shot back-to-back. In addition, Black Panther is a continuation on the events that occurred in Captain America: Civil War and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\n\\nSilent film winners\\nAt the 1st Academy Awards, the Best Picture award – then named \"Academy Award for Outstanding Picture\" – was presented to the 1927 silent film Wings.\\nThe Artist (with the exception of a single scene of dialogue, and dream sequence with sound effects) was the first silent film since Wings to win Best Picture. It was the first silent nominee since 1928\\'s The Patriot. It was the first Best Picture winner to be shot entirely in black-and-white since 1960\\'s The Apartment. (Schindler\\'s List, the 1993 winner, was predominantly black-and-white but it did contain some color sequences).\\n\\nVersion availability\\nNo Best Picture winner has been lost, though a few such as All Quiet on the Western Front and Lawrence of Arabia exist only in a form altered from their original, award-winning release form. This has usually been due to editing for reissue (and subsequently partly restored by archivists). Other winners and nominees, such as Tom Jones (prior to its 2018 reissues by The Criterion Collection and the British Film Institute) and Star Wars, are widely available only in subsequently altered versions. The Broadway Melody originally had some sequences photographed in two-color Technicolor. This footage survives only in black and white.The 1928 film The Patriot is the only Best Picture nominee that is lost (about one-third is extant). The Racket, also from 1928, was believed lost for many years until a print was found in Howard Hughes\\' archives. It has since been restored and shown on Turner Classic Movies. The only surviving complete prints of 1931\\'s East Lynne and 1934\\'s The White Parade exist within the UCLA film archive.\\n\\nCeremony mistake\\nIn 2017, at the 89th Academy Awards, presenter Faye Dunaway read La La Land as the winner of the award. However, she and Warren Beatty had mistakenly been given the duplicate envelope for the \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" award, which Emma Stone had won for her role in La La Land moments prior. When the mistake was realized, the show\\'s producers rushed onstage to correct it; in the resulting chaos, it was La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz who finally announced that Moonlight was the real winner.\\n\\nWinners and nominees\\nIn the list below, winners are listed first in the gold row, followed by the other nominees. Except for the early years (when the Academy used a non-calendar year), the year shown is the one in which the film first premiered in Los Angeles County, California; normally this is also the year of first release, however, it may be the year after first release (as with Casablanca and, if the film-festival premiere is considered, Crash). This is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Picture Oscar, awarded in 2006. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony. Each individual entry shows the title followed by nominee.\\nUntil 1950, the Best Picture award was given to the production company; from 1951 on, it has gone to the producer or producers. The Academy used the producer credits of the Producers Guild of America (PGA) until 1998, when all five producers of Shakespeare in Love made speeches after its win. A three-producer limit has been applied some years since. There was controversy over the exclusion of some PGA-credited producers of Crash and Little Miss Sunshine. The Academy can make exceptions to the limit, as when Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack were posthumously among the four nominated for The Reader. However, now any number of producers on a film can be nominated for Best Picture, should they be deemed eligible.\\nFor the first ceremony, three films were nominated for the award. For the following three years, five films were nominated for the award. This was expanded to eight in 1933, to ten in 1934, and to twelve in 1935, before being dropped back to ten in 1937. In 1945, it was further reduced to five. This number remained until 2009, when the limit was raised to ten and later adjusted in 2011, to vary between five and ten.\\nFor the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928, and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.\\n\\n1920s\\n1930s\\n1940s\\n1950s\\n1960s\\n1970s\\n1980s\\n1990s\\n2000s\\n2010s\\nIndividuals with multiple wins\\nIndividuals with multiple nominations\\nProduction companies with multiple nominations and wins\\nSee also\\nBAFTA Award for Best Film\\nIndependent Spirit Award for Best Film\\nCritics\\' Choice Movie Award for Best Picture\\nGolden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama\\nGolden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\\nProducers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture\\nScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture\\nList of actors who have appeared in multiple Best Picture winners\\nList of superlative Academy Award winners and nominees\\nList of presenters of the Academy Award for Best Picture\\nList of Big Five Academy Award winners and nominees\\nGolden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture\\nList of Academy Award-winning films\\nList of film production companies\\nList of films considered the best\\nLists of films\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOscars.org (official Academy site)\\nOscar.com (official ceremony site)\\nThe Academy Awards Database (official site)',\n",
              " 'Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor': \"The Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given in honor of an actor who has delivered an outstanding performance in a supporting role while working within the film industry. The award is traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Supporting Actress winner.\\nAt the 9th Academy Awards ceremony held in 1937, Walter Brennan was the first winner of this award for his role in Come and Get It. Initially, winners in both supporting acting categories were awarded plaques instead of statuettes. Beginning with the 16th ceremony held in 1944, however, winners received full-sized statuettes. Currently, nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the actors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the Academy.Since its inception, the award has been given to 75 actors. Brennan has received the most awards in this category with three awards. Brennan, Jeff Bridges, Robert Duvall, Arthur Kennedy, Jack Nicholson, Claude Rains, and Al Pacino were nominated on four occasions, more than any other actor. As of the 2020 ceremony, Brad Pitt is the most recent winner in this category for his performance as Cliff Booth in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\\n\\nWinners and nominees\\nIn the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release in Los Angeles County; the ceremonies are always held the following year.\\n\\n1930s\\n1940s\\n1950s\\n1960s\\n1970s\\n1980s\\n1990s\\n2000s\\n2010s\\nMultiple wins and nominations\\nMultiple character nominations\\n2 nominationsMax Corkle\\nJames Gleason in Here Comes Mr. Jordan\\nJack Warden in Heaven Can Wait\\n\\nMultiple nominations from the same film\\nHarry Carey and Claude Rains in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)\\nLeo Genn and Peter Ustinov in Quo Vadis (1951)\\nBrandon deWilde and Jack Palance in Shane (1953)\\nLee J.

              " 'Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences': 'The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS, often pronounced ; also known as simply the Academy or the Motion Picture Academy) is a professional honorary organization with the stated goal of advancing the arts and sciences of motion pictures. The Academy\\'s corporate management and general policies are overseen by a board of governors, which includes representatives from each of the craft branches.\\nAs of April 2020, the organization was estimated to consist of around 9,921 motion picture professionals. The Academy is an international organization and membership is open to qualified filmmakers around the world.\\nThe Academy is known around the world for its annual Academy Awards, now officially and popularly known as \"The Oscars\".In addition, the Academy holds the Governors Awards annually for lifetime achievement in film; presents Scientific and Technical Awards annually; gives Student Academy Awards annually to filmmakers at the undergraduate and graduate level; awards up to five Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting annually; and operates the Margaret Herrick Library (at the Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study) in Beverly Hills, California, and the Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The Academy plans to open the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles in 2021.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe notion of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) began with Louis B. Mayer, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). He said he wanted to create an organization that would mediate labor disputes without unions and improve the industry\\'s image. He met with actor Conrad Nagel, director Fred Niblo, and the head of the Association of Motion Picture Producers, Fred Beetson to discuss these matters. The idea of this elite club having an annual banquet was discussed, but no mention of awards at that time. They also established that membership into the organization would only be open to people involved in one of the five branches of the industry: actors, directors, writers, technicians, and producers.After their brief meeting, Mayer gathered up a group of thirty-six people involved in the film industry and invited them to a formal banquet at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on January 11, 1927. That evening Mayer presented to those guests what he called the International Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Everyone in the room that evening became a founder of the Academy. Between that evening and when the official Articles of Incorporation for the organization were filed on May 4, 1927, the \"International\" was dropped from the name, becoming the \"Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\".Several organizational meetings were held prior to the first official meeting held on May 6, 1927. Their first organizational meeting was held on May 11 at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel. At that meeting Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. was elected as the first president of the Academy, while Fred Niblo was the first vice-president, and their first roster, composed of 230 members, was printed. That night, the Academy also bestowed its first honorary membership, to Thomas Edison. Initially, the Academy was broken down into five main groups, or branches, although this number of branches has grown over the years. The original five were: Producers, Actors, Directors, Writers and Technicians.The initial concerns of the group had to do with labor.\" However, as time went on, the organization moved \"further away from involvement in labor-management arbitrations and negotiations.\" One of several committees formed in those initial days was for \"Awards of Merit,\" but it was not until May 1928 that the committee began to have serious discussions about the structure of the awards and the presentation ceremony. By July 1928, the board of directors had approved a list of 12 awards to be presented. During July the voting system for the Awards was established, and the nomination and selection process began. This \"award of merit for distinctive achievement\" is what we know now as the Academy Awards.\\nThe initial location of the organization was 6912 Hollywood Boulevard. In November 1927, the Academy moved to the Roosevelt Hotel at 7010 Hollywood Boulevard, which was also the month the Academy\\'s library began compiling a complete collection of books and periodicals dealing with the industry from around the world. In May 1928, the Academy authorized the construction of a state of the art screening room, to be located in the Club lounge of the hotel. The screening room was not completed until April 1929.With the publication of Report on Incandescent Illumination in 1928, the Academy began a long history of publishing books to assist its members. Another early initiative concerned training Army Signal Corps officers.In 1929, Academy members in a joint venture with the University of Southern California created America\\'s first film school to further the art and science of moving pictures. The school\\'s founding faculty included Fairbanks (President of the Academy), D. W. Griffith, William C. deMille, Ernst Lubitsch, Irving Thalberg, and Darryl F. Zanuck.1930 saw another move, to 7046 Hollywood Boulevard, in order to accommodate the enlarging staff, and by December of that year the library was acknowledged as \"having one of the most complete collections of information on the motion picture industry anywhere in existence.\" They remained at that location until 1935 when further growth caused them to move once again. This time, the administrative offices moved to one location, to the Taft Building at the corner of Hollywood and Vine, while the library moved to 1455 North Gordon Street.In 1934, the Academy began publication of the Screen Achievement Records Bulletin, which today is known as the Motion Picture Credits Database. This is a list of film credits up for an Academy Award, as well as other films released in Los Angeles County, using research materials from the Academy\\'s Margaret Herrick Library. Another publication of the 1930s was the first annual Academy Players Directory in 1937. The Directory was published by the Academy until 2006 when it was sold to a private concern. The Academy had been involved in the technical aspects of film making since its founding in 1927, and by 1938, the Science and Technology Council consisted of 36 technical committees addressing technical issues related to sound recording and reproduction, projection, lighting, film preservation, and cinematography.In 2009, the inaugural Governors Awards were held, at which the Academy awards the Academy Honorary Award, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.\\nIn 2016, the Academy became the target of criticism for its failure to recognize the achievements of minority professionals. For the second year in a row, all 20 nominees in the major acting categories were white. The president of the Academy Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the first African American and third woman to lead the Academy, denied in 2015 that there was a problem. When asked if the Academy had difficulty with recognizing diversity, she replied \"Not at all. Not at all.\" When the nominations for acting were all white for a second year in a row Gil Robertson IV, president of the African American Film Critics Association called it \"offensive.\" The actors\\' branch is \"overwhelmingly white\" and the question is raised whether conscious or unconscious racial biases played a role.Spike Lee, interviewed shortly after the all-white nominee list was published, pointed to Hollywood leadership as the root problem, \"We may win an Oscar now and then, but an Oscar is not going to fundamentally change how Hollywood does business. I\\'m not talking about Hollywood stars. I\\'m talking about executives. We\\'re not in the room.\" Boone Isaacs also released a statement, in which she said \"I am both heartbroken and frustrated about the lack of inclusion. This is a difficult but important conversation, and it\\'s time for big changes.\" After Boone Isaac\\'s statement, prominent African-Americans such as director Spike Lee, actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, and activist Rev. Al Sharpton called for a boycott of the 2016 Oscars for failing to recognize minority achievements, the board voted to make \"historic\" changes to its membership. The Academy stated that by 2020 it would double its number of women and minority members.  While the Academy has addressed a higher profile for African-Americans, it has yet to raise the profile of its Asian-American artists, in front of and behind the camera.\\nCasting director David Rubin was elected President of the Academy in August, 2019.In 2020, Parasite became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture.\\n\\nGalleries and theaters\\nThe Academy\\'s numerous and diverse operations are housed in three facilities in the Los Angeles area: the headquarters building in Beverly Hills, which was constructed specifically for the Academy, and two Centers for Motion Picture Study – one in Beverly Hills, the other in Hollywood – which were existing structures restored and transformed to contain the Academy\\'s Library, Film Archive and other departments and programs.\\n\\nCurrent\\nAcademy Headquarters\\nThe Academy Headquarters Building in Beverly Hills once housed two galleries that were open free to the public. The Grand Lobby Gallery and the Fourth Floor Gallery offered changing exhibits related to films, film-making and film personalities. These galleries have since been closed in preparation for the opening of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in 2020.\\nThe building includes the Samuel Goldwyn Theater, which seats 1,012, and was designed to present films at maximum technical accuracy, with state-of-the-art projection equipment and sound system. The theater is busy year-round with the Academy\\'s public programming, members-only screenings, movie premieres and other special activities (including the live television broadcast of the Academy Awards nominations announcement every January). The building once housed the Academy Little Theater, is a 67-seat screening facility, but this was converted to additional office space in a building remodel.\\n\\nPickford Center for Motion Picture Study\\nThe Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study, located in central Hollywood and named for legendary actress and Academy founder Mary Pickford, houses several Academy departments, including the Academy Film Archive, the Science and Technology Council, Student Academy Awards and Grants, and the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting. The building, originally dedicated on August 18, 1948, is the oldest surviving structure in Hollywood that was designed specifically with television in mind. Additionally, it is the location of the Linwood Dunn Theater, which seats 286 people.\\n\\nFairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study\\nThe Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study is located at 333 S. La Cienega Boulevard in Beverly Hills. It is home to the Academy\\'s Margaret Herrick Library, a world-renowned, non-circulating reference and research collection devoted to the history and development of the motion picture as an art form and an industry. Established in 1928, the library is open to the public and used year-round by students, scholars, historians and industry professionals. The library is named for Margaret Herrick, the Academy\\'s first librarian who also played a major role in the Academy\\'s first televised broadcast, helping to turn the Oscar ceremony into a major annual televised event.The building itself was built in 1928, where it was originally built to be a water treatment plant for Beverly Hills. Its \"bell tower\" held water-purifying hardware.\\n\\nFormer\\nAcademy Theater in New York\\nThe Academy also has a New York City-based East Coast showcase theater, the Academy Theater at Lighthouse International. The 220-seat venue was redesigned in 2011 by renowned theater designer Theo Kalomirakis, including an extensive installation of new audio and visual equipment. The theater is in the East 59th Street headquarters of the non-profit vision loss organization, Lighthouse International. In July 2015, it was announced that the Academy was forced to move out, due to Lighthouse International selling the property the theater was in.\\n\\nUpcoming\\nThe Academy Museum of Motion Pictures\\nThe Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, a Los Angeles museum currently under construction, will be the newest facility associated with the Academy. It is scheduled to open on April 30, 2021, and will contain over 290,000 square feet (27,000 m2) of galleries, exhibition spaces, movie theaters, educational areas, and special event spaces.\\n\\nMembership\\nMembership in the Academy is by invitation only. Invitation comes from the Board of Governors. Membership eligibility may be achieved by earning a competitive Oscar nomination, or by the sponsorship of two current Academy members from the same branch to which the candidate seeks admission.New membership proposals are considered annually in the spring. Press releases announce the names of those who have recently been invited to join. Membership in the Academy does not expire, even if a member struggles later in his or her career.Academy membership is divided into 17 branches, representing different disciplines in motion pictures. Members may not belong to more than one branch. Members whose work does not fall within one of the branches may belong to a group known as \"Members at Large\". Members at Large have all the privileges of branch membership except for representation on the Board. Associate members are those closely allied to the industry but not actively engaged in motion picture production. They are not represented on the Board and do not vote on Academy Awards.\\nAccording to a February 2012 study conducted by the Los Angeles Times (sampling over 5,000 of its 5,765 members), the Academy at that time was 94% white, 77% male, 86% age 50 or older, and had a median age of 62. A third of members were previous winners or nominees of Academy Awards themselves. Of the Academy\\'s 54-member Board of Governors, 25 are female.June 29, 2016, saw a paradigm shift in the Academy\\'s selection process, resulting in a new class comprising 46% women, and 41% people of color. The effort to diversify the Academy was led by social activist, and Broadway Black managing-editor, April Reign. Reign created the Twitter hashtag #OscarsSoWhite as a means of criticizing the dearth of non-white nominees for the 2015 Academy Awards. Though the hashtag drew widespread media attention, the Academy remained obstinate on the matter of adopting a resolution that would make demonstrable its efforts to increase diversity. With the 2016 Academy Awards, many, including April Reign, were dismayed by the Academy\\'s indifference about representation and inclusion, as the 2016 nominees were once again entirely white. April Reign revived #OscarsSoWhite, and renewed her campaign efforts, including multiple media appearances and interviews with reputable news outlets. As a result of Reign\\'s campaign, the discourse surrounding representation and recognition in film spread beyond the United States of America and became a global discussion. Faced with mounting pressure to expand the Academy membership, the Academy capitulated and instituted all new policies to ensure that future Academy membership invitations would better represent the demographics of modern film-going audiences. The A2020 initiative was announced in January 2016 to double the number of women and people of color in membership by 2020.\\nMembers are able to see many new films for free at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater and other facilities within two weeks of their debut, and sometimes before release; in addition, some of the screeners are available through iTunes to its members.\\n\\nExpulsions\\nFour people are known to have been expelled from the Academy. Academy officials acknowledge that other members have been expelled in the past, most for selling their Oscar tickets, but no numbers are available.\\n\\nCarmine Caridi was expelled on February 3, 2004, for copyright infringement. He was accused of leaking screeners that had been sent to him.\\nHarvey Weinstein was expelled for \"sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment\" after an emergency meeting held on October 13, 2017.\\nBill Cosby and Roman Polanski were expelled \"in accordance with the organization\\'s Standards of Conduct\" on May 1, 2018. Cosby had been convicted of sexual assault one week earlier, while Polanski had been convicted in 1977 of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor.\\n\\nAcademy branches\\nThe 17 branches of the Academy are:\\n\\nActors\\nCasting Directors (created July 31, 2013)\\nCinematographers\\nCostume Designers (created from former Art Directors Branch)\\nDesigners (created from former Art Directors Branch)\\nDirectors\\nDocumentary\\nExecutives\\nFilm Editors\\nMake-up Artists and Hairstylists\\nMusic\\nProducers\\nPublic Relations\\nShort Films and Feature Animation\\nSound\\nVisual Effects\\nWriters\\n\\nBoard of Governors\\nAs of April 2020, the Board of Governors consists of 54 governors: three governors from each of the 17 Academy branches and three governors-at-large.

              " 'All the Right Moves (film)': 'All the Right Moves is a 1983 American sports drama film directed by Michael Chapman and starring Tom Cruise, Craig T. Nelson, Lea Thompson, Chris Penn, and Gary Graham. It was filmed on location  in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Pittsburgh.\\n\\nPlot summary\\nStefen \"Stef\" Djordjevic (Tom Cruise) is a Serbian American high school defensive back who is gifted in both sports and academics. He is seeking a college football scholarship to escape the economically depressed small western Pennsylvania town of Ampipe and a dead-end job and life working at the mill like his father and brother Greg (Gary Graham). He dreams of becoming an engineer right after he graduates from college. Ampipe is a company town whose economy is dominated by the town\\'s main employer, American Pipe & Steel, a steel mill struggling through the downturn of the early 1980s recession. Stef gets through his days with the love of his girlfriend, Lisa Lietzke (Lea Thompson), and his strong bond with his teammates.\\nMost of the film takes place after the big football game against undefeated Walnut Heights High School. Ampipe appears headed to win the game, when a fumbled handoff in the closing seconds—as well as Stefen\\'s pass interference penalty earlier in the game—leads to a Walnut Heights victory. Following the game, Coach Burt Nickerson (Craig T. Nelson) lambastes the fumbler in the locker room, telling him he \"quit\" the game. When Stefen retorts that the coach himself quit, the coach kicks him off the team.\\nIn the aftermath, disgruntled Ampipe fans vandalize Coach Nickerson\\'s house and yard. Stefen is present and is a reluctant participant, but is nonetheless seen by Nickerson as the vandals flee. From there, Stefen deals with personal battles, including dealing with the coach blackballing him among colleges because of his attitude and participation in the vandalization of Nickerson\\'s yard and house. Stefen gets in an argument with Lisa, and his best friend Brian (Penn) declines a scholarship offer to USC and plans to marry his pregnant girlfriend.\\nFrustrated by what Nickerson did, Stefan angrily confronts his former coach which ends in a shouting match out in the street. But Lisa decides to talk to Nickerson\\'s wife to try and help. In the end, Nickerson realizes he was wrong for blackballing Stefan. He has accepted a coaching position on the West Coast at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and offers Stefen a full scholarship to play football there, which he accepts.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Stefan Djordjevic\\nCraig T. Nelson as Coach Burt Nickerson\\nLea Thompson as Lisa Lietzke\\nCharles Cioffi as Pop\\nGary Graham as Greg\\nPaul Carafotes as Vinnie Salvucci\\nChris Penn as Brian\\nLeon as Shadow\\nSandy Faison as Suzie Nickerson\\nJames A. Baffico as Bosko\\nMel Winkler as Jess Covington\\nTerry O\\'Quinn as Freeman Smith\\n\\nProduction\\nThe film was produced by Stephen Deutsch, with Phillip Goldfarb as co-producer. Gary Morton of Lucille Ball Productions was executive producer.  The production was filmed over seven weeks in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in the early spring of 1983. The recently closed sixty-year-old high school (40.3217°N 78.9217°W\\ufeff / 40.3217; -78.9217), the former campus of Greater Johnstown High School, was used as the location of the film, along with Point Stadium. Actress Thompson was inserted as a new student at Ferndale Area High School for three days prior to shooting. Cruise was similarly inserted into Greater Johnstown High School, but was recognized immediately. (His only notable film part at the time was in Taps in 1981; The Outsiders and Risky Business were yet to be released.)\\n\\nReception\\nThe film was released to mixed reviews and has a score of 61% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews, and a score of a generally favorable 62% on Metacritic based on 7 reviews. Jay Carr from The Boston Globe stated \"Cruise is believable as an athlete,\" and Janet Maslin of The New York Times called it \"a well-made but sugar-coated working-class fable about a football star.\" Locally, Ed Blank of the Pittsburgh Press saw it as flawed, but captured the look of Johnstown, and Marylynn Urucchio of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette rated it as elementary but uplifting.\\nAmong the unfavorable reviews, TV Guide called the movie \"cliche-riddled\" and Richard Corliss of Time called it a \"naive little movie (that) hopes to prove itself the Flashdance of football.\" In 2018, Thompson stated she initially did not want the part, as the script required her to participate in two nude scenes, but Cruise persuaded the producers to drop one of the scenes.\\n\\nSee also\\nList of American films of 1983\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nAll the Right Moves at IMDb\\nAll the Right Moves at AllMovie',\n",

A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. Some warehouses are partially automated with systems built by Amazon Robotics.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n= = Website =\\nThe domain amazon.com attracted at least 615 million visitors annually by 2008; by the beginning of 2016, over 130 million customers were visiting the U.S. website each month. The company has invested heavily in a massive amount of server capacity for its website, especially to handle the excessive traffic during the Christmas holiday season. According to Alexa Internet rankings, amazon.com is the third most popular website in the United States and the 14th most popular website worldwide.\\nResults generated by Amazon\\'s search engine are partly determined by promotional fees. The company\\'s localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\\n\\nReviews\\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicate the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicate that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. Customers may comment or vote on the reviews, indicating whether they found a review helpful to them. If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.When publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available—the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".There have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals\\' works.\\n\\nContent search\\n\"Search Inside the Book\" is a feature which allows customers to search for keywords in the full text of many books in the catalog. The feature started with 120,000 titles (or 33 million pages of text) on October 23, 2003.\\n\\nThird-party sellers\\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon. Associates receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs. In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads. It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.Associates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched (rumored to be internally called \"Project Genesis\") to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers\\' browsing history. In 2019, Amazon launched a bigger local online store in Singapore to expand its product selection in the face of intensifying competition with competitors in the region.In July 2019 the 3rd U.S. City Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled that Amazon can be held accountable for faulty third-party sales. The decision ran counter to a past lower court ruling that had favored Amazon. Heather Oberdorf had sued the company in 2016 over a dog leash that snapped, causing permanent loss of vision in one eye. If upheld, the decision would expose Amazon and similar platform businesses to strict liability lawsuits for defective products, which represents a major change in the law. The panel sent the case back to the lower court, to decide whether the leash was actually defective.\\n\\nAmazon sales rank\\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) provides an indication of the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon. While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists. Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon\\'s lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales. For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors. While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR, though Amazon states:\\n\\nPlease keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers—we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\\n\\nMulti-level sales strategy\\nAmazon employs a multi-level e-commerce strategy. Amazon started by focusing on business-to-consumer relationships between itself and its customers and business-to-business relationships between itself and its suppliers and then moved to facilitate customer-to-customer with the Amazon marketplace which acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions. The company lets anyone sell nearly anything using its platform. In addition to an affiliate program that lets anyone post Amazon links and earn a commission on click-through sales, there is now a program which lets those affiliates build entire websites based on Amazon\\'s platform.Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.In November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle. The store is 5,500 square feet and prices for all products match those on its website. Amazon will open its tenth physical book store in 2017; media speculation suggests Amazon plans to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country.In June 2018, it was reported that Amazon planned to open brick and mortar bookstores in Germany.In September 2020, Amazon launched Luxury Stores on its mobile app, where Oscar de la Renta become the first and only label to partner with the firm.\\n\\nFinances\\nAmazon.com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model; Amazon takes a small percentage of the sale price of each item that is sold through its website while also allowing companies to advertise their products by paying to be listed as featured products. As of 2018, Amazon.com is ranked 8th on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.For the fiscal year 2018, Amazon reported earnings of US$10.07 billion, with an annual revenue of US$232.887 billion, an increase of 30.9% over the previous fiscal cycle. Since 2007 sales increased from 14.835 billion to 232.887 billion, thanks to continued business expansion.Amazon\\'s market capitalization went over US$1 trillion again in early February 2020 after the announcement of the fourth quarter 2019 results. Amazon\\'s total employees now number 798,000.\\n\\nControversies\\nSince its founding, the company has attracted criticism and controversy for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools; forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA; leading customers away from bookshops; adversely impacting the environment; placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers; actively opposing unionization efforts; remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination; and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content. Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon. Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap.it countered Amazon\\'s promotion by offering $10 off from their products.The company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\" In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent. In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening and racist products that might affect the consumer\\'s health.\\n\\nEnvironmental impact\\nIn 2018, Amazon emitted 44.4 million metric tons of CO2.In September 2019, Amazon workers organized a walk-out as part of the Global Climate Strike. An internal group called Amazon Employees for Climate Justice said over 1,800 employees in 25 cities and 14 countries committed to participating in the action to protest Amazon\\'s environmental impact and inaction to climate change. This group of workers petitioned Jeff Bezos and Amazon with three specific demands: to stop donating to politicians and lobbyists that deny climate change, to stop working with fossil fuel companies to accelerate oil and gas extraction, and to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2030.Amazon has introduced the Shipment Zero program, however Shipment Zero has only committed to reducing 50% of its shipments to net zero by 2030. Also, even that 50% does not necessarily mean a decrease in emissions compared to current levels given Amazon\\'s rate of growth in orders.That said, Amazon\\'s CEO has also signed the Climate Pledge, in which Amazon would meet the Paris climate agreement goals 10 years ahead of schedule, and would be carbon-neutral by 2040. Besides this pledge, it also ordered 100 000 electric delivery trucks from Rivian.Amazon funds both climate denial groups including the Competitive Enterprise Institute and politicians denying climate change including Jim Inhofe.In November 2018, a community action group opposed the construction permit delivered to Goodman Group for the construction of a 160,000 square metres (1,700,000 sq ft) logisitics platform Amazon will operate at Lyon–Saint-Exupéry Airport. In February 2019, Étienne Tête filed a request on behalf of a second regional community action group asking the administrative court to decide whether the platform served a sufficiently important public interest to justify its environmental impact. Construction has been suspended while these matters are decided.Amazon considered making an option for Prime customers to have packages delivered at the most efficient and environmentally-friendly time (allowing the company to combine shipments with the same destination) but decided against it out of fear customers might reduce purchases. Since 2019, the company has instead offered customers an \"Amazon Day\" option, where all orders are delivered on the same day, emphasizing customer convenience, and it occasionally offers Prime customers credits in return for selecting slower and less expensive shipping options.\\n\\nSelling counterfeit, unsafe and discarded items\\nThe selling of counterfeit products by Amazon has attracted widespread notice, with both purchases marked as being fulfilled by third parties and those shipped directly from Amazon warehouses being found to be counterfeit. This has included some products sold directly by Amazon itself and marked as \"ships from and sold by Amazon.com\". Counterfeit charging cables sold on Amazon as purported Apple products have been found to be a fire hazard. Such counterfeits have included a wide array of products, from big ticket items to every day items such as tweezers, gloves, and umbrellas. More recently, this has spread to Amazon\\'s newer grocery services. Counterfeiting was reported to be especially a problem for artists and small businesses whose products were being rapidly copied for sale on the site.One Amazon business practice that encourages counterfeiting is that, by default, seller accounts on Amazon are set to use \"commingled inventory\". With this practice, the goods that a seller sends to Amazon are mixed with those of the producer of the product and with those of all other sellers that supply what is supposed to be the same product.In June 2019, Buzzfeed reported that some products identified on the site as \"Amazon\\'s choice\" were low quality, had a history of customer complaints, and exhibited evidence of product review manipulation.In August 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that they had found more than 4,000 items for sale on Amazon\\'s site that had been declared unsafe by federal agencies, had misleading labels, or had been banned by federal regulators.In the wake of the WSJ investigation, three U.S. senators –  Richard Blumenthal, Ed Markey, and Bob Menendez – sent an open letter to Jeff Bezos demanding him to take action about the selling of unsafe items on the site. The letter said that \"Unquestionably, Amazon is falling short of its commitment to keeping safe those consumers who use its massive platform.\" The letter included a number of questions about the company\\'s practices and gave Bezos a deadline to respond by September 29, 2019, saying \"We call on you to immediately remove from the platform all the problematic products examined in the recent WSJ report; explain how you are going about this process; conduct a sweeping internal investigation of your enforcement and consumer safety policies; and institute changes that will continue to keep unsafe products off your platform.\" Earlier in the same month, senators Blumenthal and Menendez had sent Bezos a letter about the Buzzfeed report.In December 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that some people were literally retrieving trash out of dumpsters and selling it as new products on Amazon. The reporters ran an experiment and determined that it was easy for a seller to set up an account and sell cleaned up junk as new products. In addition to trash, sellers were obtaining inventory from clearance bins, thrift stores, and pawn shops.In August 2020, an appeals court in California ruled that Amazon can be held liable for unsafe products sold on its website. A California woman had bought a replacement laptop battery that caught fire and caused her to receive third-degree burns.\\n\\nTax avoidance\\nAmazon\\'s tax affairs were investigated in China, Germany, Poland, South Korea, France, Japan, Ireland, Singapore, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, United States and Portugal. According to a report released by Fair Tax Mark in 2019, Amazon is the worst offender of tax avoidance, having paid an 12% effective tax rate  between 2010-2018, in contrast with 35% corporate tax rate in the US during the same period. Amazon countered that it had an 24% effective tax rate during the same period.\\n\\nComments by Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders\\nIn early 2018, President Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon\\'s use of the United States Postal Service and its prices for the delivery of packages, stating, \"I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,\" Trump tweeted. \"Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne [sic] by the American Taxpayer.\" Amazon\\'s shares fell by 6 percent as a result of Trump\\'s comments. Shepard Smith of Fox News disputed Trump\\'s claims and pointed to evidence that the USPS was offering below-market prices to all customers with no advantage to Amazon. However, analyst Tom Forte pointed to the fact that Amazon\\'s payments to the USPS are not made public and that their contract has a reputation for being \"a sweetheart deal\".Throughout the summer of 2018, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Amazon\\'s wages and working conditions in a series of YouTube videos and media appearances. He also pointed to the fact that Amazon had paid no federal income tax in the previous year. Sanders solicited stories from Amazon warehouse workers who felt exploited by the company. One such story, by James Bloodworth, described the environment as akin to \"a low-security prison\" and stated that the company\\'s culture used an Orwellian newspeak. These reports cited a finding by New Food Economy that one third of fulfilment center workers in Arizona were on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Responses by Amazon included incentives for employees to tweet positive stories and a statement which called the salary figures used by Sanders \"inaccurate and misleading\". The statement also charged that it was inappropriate for him to refer to SNAP as \"food stamps\". On September 5, 2018, Sanders along with Ro Khanna introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act aimed at Amazon and other alleged beneficiaries of corporate welfare such as Walmart, McDonald\\'s and Uber. Among the bill\\'s supporters were Tucker Carlson of Fox News and Matt Taibbi who criticized himself and other journalists for not covering Amazon\\'s contribution to wealth inequality earlier.On October 2, 2018, Amazon announced that its minimum wage for all American employees would be raised to $15 per hour. Sanders congratulated the company for making this decision.\\n\\nOpposition to trade unions\\nAmazon has opposed efforts by trade unions to organize in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2001, 850 employees in Seattle were laid off by Amazon.com after a unionization drive. The Washington Alliance of Technological Workers (WashTech) accused the company of violating union laws, and claimed Amazon managers subjected them to intimidation and heavy propaganda. Amazon denied any link between the unionization effort and layoffs. Also in 2001, Amazon.co.uk hired a US management consultancy organization, The Burke Group, to assist in defeating a campaign by the Graphical, Paper and Media Union (GPMU, now part of Unite the Union) to achieve recognition in the Milton Keynes distribution depot. It was alleged that the company victimized or sacked four union members during the 2001 recognition drive and held a series of captive meetings with employees.An Amazon training video that was leaked in 2018 stated \"We are not anti-union, but we are not neutral either. We do not believe unions are in the best interest of our customers or shareholders or most importantly, our associates.\" Two years later, it was found that Whole Foods was using a heat map to track which stores had the highest levels of pro-union sentiment. Factors including racial diversity, proximity to other unions, poverty levels in the surrounding community and calls to the National Labor Relations Board were named as contributors to \"unionization risk\".In early 2020, an Amazon internal documents were leaked, it said that Whole Foods has been using an interactive heat map to monitor its 510 locations across the U.S. and assign each store a unionization risk score based on such criteria as employee loyalty, turnover rate and racial diversity. Data collected in the heat map suggest that stores with low racial and ethnic diversity, especially those located in poor communities, are more likely to unionize.\\n\\nWorking conditions\\nFormer employees, current employees, the media, and politicians have criticized Amazon for poor working conditions at the company. In 2011, it was publicized that workers had to carry out tasks in 100 °F (38 °C) heat at the Breinigsville, Pennsylvania warehouse. As a result of these inhumane conditions, employees became extremely uncomfortable and suffered from dehydration and collapse. Loading-bay doors were not opened to allow in fresh air because of concerns over theft. Amazon\\'s initial response was to pay for an ambulance to sit outside on call to cart away overheated employees. The company eventually installed air conditioning at the warehouse.Some workers, \"pickers\", who travel the building with a trolley and a handheld scanner \"picking\" customer orders can walk up to 15 miles (24 kilometres) during their workday and if they fall behind on their targets, they can be reprimanded. The handheld scanners give real-time information to the employee on how quickly or slowly they are working; the scanners also serve to allow Team Leads and Area Managers to track the specific locations of employees and how much \"idle time\" they gain when not working.In a German television report broadcast in February 2013, journalists Diana Löbl and Peter Onneken conducted a covert investigation at the distribution center of Amazon in the town of Bad Hersfeld in the German state of Hessen. The report highlights the behavior of some of the security guards, themselves being employed by a third party company, who apparently either had a neo-Nazi background or deliberately dressed in neo-Nazi apparel and who were intimidating foreign and temporary female workers at its distribution centers. The third party security company involved was delisted by Amazon as a business contact shortly after that report.In March 2015, it was reported in The Verge that Amazon would be removing non-compete clauses of 18 months in length from its US employment contracts for hourly-paid workers, after criticism that it was acting unreasonably in preventing such employees from finding other work. Even short-term temporary workers have to sign contracts that prohibit them from working at any company where they would \"directly or indirectly\" support any good or service that competes with those they helped support at Amazon, for 18 months after leaving Amazon, even if they are fired or made redundant.A 2015 front-page article in The New York Times profiled several former Amazon employees who together described a \"bruising\" workplace culture in which workers with illness or other personal crises were pushed out or unfairly evaluated. Bezos responded by writing a Sunday memo to employees, in which he disputed the Times\\'s account of \"shockingly callous management practices\" that he said would never be tolerated at the company.In an effort to boost employee morale, on November 2, 2015, Amazon announced that it would be extending six weeks of paid leave for new mothers and fathers. This change includes birth parents and adoptive parents and can be applied in conjunction with existing maternity leave and medical leave for new mothers.In mid-2018, investigations by journalists and media outlets such as The Guardian reported poor working conditions at Amazon\\'s fulfillment centers. Later in 2018, another article exposed poor working conditions for Amazon\\'s delivery drivers.In response to criticism that Amazon does not pay its workers a livable wage, Jeff Bezos announced beginning November 1, 2018, all US and UK Amazon employees will earn a $15 an hour minimum wage. Amazon will also lobby to make $15 an hour the federal minimum wage. At the same time, Amazon also eliminated stock awards and bonuses for hourly employees.On Black Friday 2018, Amazon warehouse workers in several European countries, including Italy, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, went on strike to protest inhumane working conditions and low pay.The Daily Beast reported in March 2019 that emergency services responded to 189 calls from 46 Amazon warehouses in 17 states between the years 2013 and 2018, all relating to suicidal employees. The workers attributed their mental breakdowns to employer-imposed social isolation, aggressive surveillance, and the hurried and dangerous working conditions at these fulfillment centers. One former employee told The Daily Beast \"It\\'s this isolating colony of hell where people having breakdowns is a regular occurrence.\"On July 15, 2019, during the onset of Amazon\\'s \"Prime Day\" sale event, Amazon employees working in the United States and Germany went on strike in protest of unfair wages and poor working conditions.In March 2020, during the coronavirus outbreak when the government instructed companies to restrict social contact, Amazon\\'s UK staff was forced to work overtime to meet the demand spiked by the disease. A GMB spokesperson said the company had put \"profit before safety\". GMB has continued to raise concerns regarding \"gruelling conditions, unrealistic productivity targets, surveillance, bogus self-employment and a refusal to recognise or engage with unions unless forced\", calling for the UK government and safety regulators to take action to address these issues.In August 2019, BBC reported on Amazon\\'s Twitter ambassadors. Their constant support for and defense of Amazon and its practices have led many Twitter users to suspect that they are in fact bots, being used to dismiss the issues effecting Amazon workers.In its 2020 statement to its US shareholders, Amazon stated that \"we respect and support the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights\". Operation of these Global Human Rights Principles has been \"long-held at Amazon, and codifying them demonstrates our support for fundamental human rights and the dignity of workers everywhere we operate\".On November 27, 2020, Amnesty International said, workers in working for Amazon have faced great health and safety risks since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. On Black Friday, one of Amazon\\'s busiest periods, company failed to ensure the key safety features in France, Poland, the United Kingdom and USA. Workers have been risking their health and lives to ensure essential goods are delivered to consumer doorsteps, helping Amazon achieve record profits.On January 6, 2021, Amazon said that it is planning to build 20,000 affordable houses by spending $2 billion in the regions where the major employments are located.On January 24, 2021, Amazon said that it was planning to open a pop-up clinic hosted in partnership with Virginia Mason Franciscan Health in Seattle in order to vaccinate 2,000 persons against COVID-19 on the first day.In February 2021, Amazon said that it was planning to put cameras in its delivery vehicles. Although many drivers were upset of this decision, Amazon said that the videos were only be sent in certain circumstances.\\n\\nConflict of interest with the CIA and DOD\\nIn 2013, Amazon secured a US$600 million contract with the CIA, which poses a potential conflict of interest involving the Bezos-owned The Washington Post and his newspaper\\'s coverage of the CIA. Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security Studies, said, \"It\\'s a serious potential conflict of interest for a major newspaper like The Washington Post to have a contractual relationship with the government and the most secret part of the government.\" This was later followed by a US$10 billion contract with the U.S. Department of Defense.\\n\\nSeattle head tax and houselessness services\\nIn May 2018, Amazon threatened the Seattle City Council over an employee head tax proposal that would have funded houselessness services and low-income housing. The tax would have cost Amazon about $800 per employee, or 0.7% of their average salary. In retaliation, Amazon paused construction on a new building, threatened to limit further investment in the city, and funded a repeal campaign. Although originally passed, the measure was soon repealed after an expensive repeal campaign spearheaded by Amazon.\\n\\nNashville Operations Center of Excellence\\nThe incentives given by the Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County to Amazon for their new Operations Center of Excellence in Nashville Yards, a site owned by developer Southwest Value Partners, have been controversial, including the decision by the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development to keep the full extent of the agreement secret. The incentives include \"$102 million in combined grants and tax credits for a scaled-down Amazon office building\" as well as \"a $65 million cash grant for capital expenditures\" in exchange for the creation of 5,000 jobs over seven years.The Tennessee Coalition for Open Government called for more transparency. Another local organization known as the People\\'s Alliance for Transit, Housing, and Employment (PATHE) suggested no public money should be given to Amazon; instead, it should be spent on building more public housing for the working poor and the homeless and investing in more public transportation for Nashvillians. Others suggested incentives to big corporations do not improve the local economy.In November 2018, the proposal to give Amazon $15 million in incentives was criticized by the Nashville Firefighters Union and the Nashville chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, who called it \"corporate welfare.\" In February 2019, another $15.2 million in infrastructure was approved by the council, although it was voted down by three council members, including Councilwoman Angie Henderson who dismissed it as \"cronyism\".\\n\\nFacial recognition technology and law enforcement\\nWhile Amazon has publicly opposed secret government surveillance, as revealed by Freedom of Information Act requests it has supplied facial recognition support to law enforcement in the form of the Rekognition technology and consulting services. Initial testing included the city of Orlando, Florida, and Washington County, Oregon. Amazon offered to connect Washington County with other Amazon government customers interested in Rekognition and a body camera manufacturer. These ventures are opposed by a coalition of civil rights groups with concern that they could lead to an expansion of surveillance and be prone to abuse. Specifically, it could automate the identification and tracking of anyone, particularly in the context of potential police body camera integration. Because of the backlash, the city of Orlando publicly stated it will no longer use the technology, but may revisit this decision at a later date.\\n\\nAccess to NHS data\\nThe UK government awarded Amazon a contract that gives the company free access to information about healthcare published by the UK\\'s National Health Service. This will, for example, be used by Amazon\\'s Alexa to answer medical questions, although Alexa also uses many other sources of information. The material, which excludes patient data, could also allow the company to make, advertise and sell its own products. The contract allows Amazon access to information on symptoms, causes and definitions of conditions, and \"all related copyrightable content and data and other materials\". Amazon can then create \"new products, applications, cloud-based services and/or distributed software\", which the NHS will not benefit from financially. The company can also share the information with third parties. The government said that allowing Alexa devices to offer expert health advice to users will reduce pressure on doctors and pharmacists.\\n\\nCollection of data and surveillance\\nOn February 17, 2020, a Panorama documentary highlighted the amount of data collected by the company and the move into surveillance causing concerns of politicians and regulators in the US and Europe.\\n\\nAntitrust complaints\\nOn June 11, 2020, the European Union announced that it will be pressing charges against Amazon over its treatment of third-party e-commerce sellers.In July 2020, Amazon along with other tech giants Apple, Google and Facebook were accused of maintaining harmful power and anti-competitive strategies to quash potential competitors in the market. The CEOs of respective firms appeared in a teleconference on July 29, 2020 before the lawmakers of the U.S. House Antitrust Subcommittee. In October 2020, the antitrust subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives released a report accusing Amazon of abusing a monopoly position in ecommerce to unfairly compete with sellers on its own platform.\\n\\nAnti-vaccination and non-scientific cancer \\'cures\\'\\nAnti-vaccination and non evidence-based cancer \\'cures\\' have routinely appeared high in Amazon\\'s books and videos. This may be due to positive reviews posted by supporters of untested methods, or gaming of the algorithms by truther communities, rather than any intent on Amazon\\'s part.Wired magazine found that Amazon Prime Video was full of \\'pseudoscientific documentaries laden with conspiracy theories and pointing viewers towards unproven treatments\\'.U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) expressed concern that Amazon was “surfacing and recommending products and content that discourage parents from vaccinating their children.” Amazon subsequently removed five anti-vaccination documentaries. Amazon also removed 12 books that unscientifically claimed bleach could cure conditions including malaria and childhood autism. This followed an NBC News report about parents who used it in a misguided attempt to reverse their children\\'s autism.\\n\\nResponse to COVID-19 pandemic\\nHazard pay and overtime\\nAmazon introduced new policies to reward frontline workers for continuing to come into work during the crisis. One of these policies, announced on March 16, 2020 was a temporary $2-per-hour rise in pay. This policy expired in June 2020. Amazon also announced a policy of unlimited, unpaid time off that lasted until April 30, 2020.\\n\\nAdditional hiring as a result of pandemic\\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon introduced temporary restrictions on the sale of non-essential goods. In March 2020, it hired some 100,000 more staff in the US to help deal with essential items such as food and medical equipment. It also reported that it was so busy that it was unable to bring on board new customers and therefore had to have a waiting list. In April, the firm announced that it was going to hire up to 75,000 workers to help deal with increased demand. In September 2020, the company announced it would hire an additional 100,000 workers in the United States and Canada.\\n\\nEmployee protests during COVID-19\\nDuring the pandemic there have been protests by the Amazon workers at warehouses in the US, France, and Italy. The BBC reported that there were confirmed coronavirus cases in more than 50 locations. The reason for the protests is the company policy to \"run normal shifts\" despite many positive cases of the virus. According to the UNI Global Union, \"Amazon cannot act like this is business as usual. We are facing a deadly virus that has already taken the lives of thousands of people and paralyzed the world\\'s economy. If distribution centers are not safe for workers right now, they should be closed immediately.\" In Spain, the company has faced legal complaints over its policies. Despite workers at 19 warehouses in the US having tested positive for COVID-19, Amazon did not shut down warehouses, only doing so when forced by the government or because of protests. A group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos in March 2020, expressing concerns about worker safety.An Amazon warehouse protest on March 30, 2020, in Staten Island led to its organizer, Christian Smalls, being fired. Amazon defended the decision by saying that Smalls was supposed to be in self-isolation at the time and leading the protest put its other workers at risk. Smalls has called this response \"ridiculous\". The New York state attorney general, Letitia James, is considering legal retaliation to the firing which she called \"immoral and inhumane.\" She also asked the National Labor Relations Board to investigate Smalls\\' firing. Smalls himself accuses the company of retaliating against him for organizing a protest. At the Staten Island warehouse, one case of COVID-19 has been confirmed by Amazon; workers believe there are more, and say that the company has not cleaned the building, given them suitable protection, or informed them of potential cases. Smalls added specifically that there are many workers there in risk categories, and the protest only demanded that the building be sanitized and the employees continue to be paid during that process. Derrick Palmer, another worker at the Staten Island facility, told The Verge that Amazon quickly communicates through text and email when they need the staff to complete mandatory overtime, but have not been using this to tell people when a colleague has contracted the disease, instead waiting days and sending managers to speak to employees in person. Amazon claim that the Staten Island protest only attracted 15 of the facility\\'s 5,000 workers, while other sources describe much larger crowds.On April 14, 2020, two Amazon employees were fired for \"repeatedly violating internal policies\", after they had circulated a petition about health risks for warehouse workers internally.On May 4, Amazon vice president Tim Bray resigned \"in dismay\" over the firing of whistle-blower employees who spoke out about the lack of COVID-19 protections, including shortages of face masks and failure to implement widespread temperature checks which were promised by the company. He said that the firings were \"chickenshit\" and \"designed to create a climate of fear\" in Amazon warehouses.In a Q1 2020 financial report, Jeff Bezos announced that Amazon expects to spend $4 billion or more (predicted operating profit for Q2) on COVID-19-related issues: personal protective equipment, higher wages for hourly teams, cleaning for facilities, and expanding Amazon\\'s COVID-19 testing capabilities. These measures intend to improve the safety and well-being of hundreds of thousands of the company\\'s employees.From the beginning of 2020 until September of the same year, the company declares that the total number of workers who have contracted the infection is 19,816.\\n\\nClosure in France\\nThe SUD (trade unions) brought a court case against Amazon for unsafe working conditions. This resulted in a French district court (Nanterre) ruling on April 15, 2020, ordering the company to limit, under threat of a €1 million per day fine, its deliveries to certain essential items, including electronics, food, medical or hygienic products, and supplies for home improvement, animals, and offices. Instead, Amazon immediately shut down its six warehouses in France, continuing to pay workers but limiting deliveries to items shipped from third-party sellers and warehouses outside of France. The company said the €100,000 fine for each prohibited item shipped could result in billions of dollars in fines even with a small fraction of items misclassified. After losing an appeal and coming to an agreement with labor unions for more pay and staggered schedules, the company reopened its French warehouses on May 19.\\n\\nLobbying\\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.Amazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders\\' meeting on May 24, 2012.In 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June. Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages. In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.In 2019 it spent $16.8m and had a team of 104 lobbyists, up from $14.4m and 103 lobbyists in 2018.\\n\\nSee also\\nAmazon Breakthrough Novel Award\\nAmazon Flexible Payments Service\\nAmazon Marketplace\\nAmazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN)\\nCamelcamelcamel – a website that tracks the prices of products sold on Amazon.com\\nList of book distributors\\nInternal carbon pricing\\nStatistically improbable phrases – Amazon.com\\'s phrase extraction technique for indexing books\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website \\nAmazon (company) companies grouped at OpenCorporates\\nBusiness data for Amazon.com, Inc.:',\n",
              " 'American Made (film)': 'American Made is a 2017 American action comedy film directed by Doug Liman, written by Gary Spinelli, and starring Tom Cruise, Domhnall Gleeson, Sarah Wright, Alejandro Edda, Mauricio Mejía, Caleb Landry Jones, and Jesse Plemons. It is inspired by the life of Barry Seal, a former TWA pilot who flew missions for the CIA, and became a drug smuggler for the Medellín Cartel in the 1980s. In order to avoid jail time, Seal became an informant for the DEA.The film was first released in Taiwan on August 18, 2017, and then in the United States on September 29, 2017. It is the first film directed by Liman to be released by Universal Pictures since The Bourne Identity in 2002, and played in 2D and IMAX in select theaters. It grossed $134 million worldwide against a budget of around $50 million and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Cruise\\'s performance.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 1978, Baton Rouge pilot Barry Seal, who flies commercial jets for TWA, is recruited by a CIA case officer calling himself Monty Schafer. He asks Seal, who has been smuggling Cuban cigars into the country via Canada, to fly clandestine reconnaissance missions for the CIA over Central America using a small, fast, twin-engine Piper Smith Aerostar 600, outfitted with sophisticated aerial surveillance cameras. Seal tells his wife, Lucy, he\\'s still with TWA.\\nIn the 1980s, Schafer asks Seal to start acting as a courier between the CIA and General Noriega in Panama. During a mission, the Medellín Cartel picks Seal up and asks him to fly cocaine on his return flights to the United States. Seal accepts and starts flying the cartel\\'s cocaine to Louisiana, delivering the drugs via airdrop in the countryside instead of landing at an airport. The CIA turns a blind eye to the drug smuggling, but the DEA tracks Seal down. To avoid the authorities, Seal and his family must relocate to the remote town of Mena, Arkansas, and his wife comes to accept the wealth generated by his new life. The small town gradually becomes wealthy and the hub of U.S. cocaine trafficking.\\nLater, Schafer asks Seal to run guns to the Nicaraguan Contras based in Honduras. Seal realizes that the Contras are not serious about the war and just want to get rich and he starts trading the guns to the cartel. The CIA sets up a Contra training base in Mena and Seal flies the Contras in, but many of them escape as soon as they arrive.\\nSeal makes so much money he buries it in suitcases in the backyard. Seal\\'s freeloading brother-in-law JB moves in, needing a job. Eventually, he starts stealing money from the Seals and is arrested after Sheriff Joe Downing catches him with a briefcase full of laundered cash. With JB out on bail, Seal gives him money and a plane ticket to Bora Bora and tells him to get lost for his safety. JB demands weekly cash and insults Lucy. As Barry chases after him, JB is killed in his car by a bomb placed by the Medellín Cartel, who had previously promised to \"take care\" of the JB problem.\\nThe FBI soon catches wind of the sudden exuberance on the streets of Mena, not helped by JB\\'s reckless spending, and eventually, the CIA shuts the program down and abandons Seal, who is arrested by the FBI, DEA, ATF and Arkansas State Police simultaneously. Seal escapes prosecution by making a deal with the White House, which wants evidence of the Sandinistas being drug traffickers. They ask Seal to get photos that tie the Medellín Cartel to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas. Seal manages to get the pictures, but the White House releases them as propaganda against the Sandinistas. Seal is prominently shown in the pictures, which leads to his indictment by the crusading state attorney general, and the cartel plotting revenge.\\nSeal is convicted but sentenced to only 1,000 hours of community service. Moving from motel to motel making video recordings of his experiences, Seal fears an explosion anytime he starts his car. As his community service is performed at the same Salvation Army building every night, Seal cannot hide from the cartel and is shot dead by assassins. The CIA destroys all evidence connecting them to Seal. After Seal is dead, the CIA continues smuggling, instead using Iran to get guns to the Contras.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Barry Seal\\nDomhnall Gleeson as Monty Schafer\\nSarah Wright as Lucy Seal\\nJesse Plemons as Sheriff Joe Downing, of Mena, Arkansas\\nCaleb Landry Jones as JB, Lucy\\'s brother\\nJayma Mays as Dana Sibota, state attorney general\\nLola Kirke as Judy Downing\\nConnor Trinneer as George W. Bush\\nMauricio Mejía as Pablo Escobar\\nAlejandro Edda as Jorge Ochoa\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nIn the summer of 2013, screenwriter Gary Spinelli was looking for a project that was based on real events. On the bonus feature of American Made, Spinelli said:\\n\\nI was looking for little hidden pieces of history. Small stories that affected larger global events and I came across the Mena story. And I always wanted to do a gangster film. Goodfellas is one of my favorite movies and I was always on the hunt to try to find my version of that. And once I started researching CIA\\'s involvement in Mena, the same name kept popping up, was this Barry Seal character. As soon as I found Barry, I knew I had a movie.\\nThe film was originally titled Mena and in 2014 was featured on The Black List, a survey showcasing the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood. On January 14, 2015, it was announced that Tom Cruise and Edge of Tomorrow Director Doug Liman would reunite for originally titled film Mena.\\n\\nCasting\\nSarah Wright, Jayma Mays and Domhnall Gleeson added to the cast in April. Jesse Plemons, Caleb Landry Jones and Lola Kirke were added to the cast in May 2015.\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography on the film began on May 18, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia. Filming locations there include counties Cherokee, Clayton, DeKalb, Fulton, Gwinnett, Morgan and Pickens. Filming on the Georgia Unit wrapped on July 12, 2015. On August 20, 2015, Cruise arrived in Medellin, Colombia, and on August 31, in Santa Marta to scout filming locations for the film. Filming in Colombia commenced on August 26, 2015 and wrapped on September 11, 2015. Production on the film resumed February 3, 2016 in New Orleans, Louisiana as filming has been suspended due to a plane crash in Colombia that occurred in September 2015. Reshoots occurred in late January 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia.\\n\\nPlane crash\\nA plane crash on the set of the film in Colombia on September 11, 2015, killed two people and caused serious injuries to another member of the crew. The plane (a twin-engine Piper Aerostar), which was carrying crew members (three American pilots), was returning to Enrique Olaya Herrera Airport in Medellín when it ran into bad weather and the crash occurred. The dead were identified as Carlos Berl and Alan Purwin, who was the founder and president of Helinet Aviation, a company which provides aerial surveillance technology to government agencies and law enforcement, and a film pilot who had worked in top films. American pilot Jimmy Lee Garland was seriously injured and rushed to a local hospital.\\n\\nRelease\\nIn May 2015, Universal set the film for release on January 6, 2017. On August 8, 2016, the film\\'s release was pushed to September 29, 2017, and its title changed from Mena to American Made. It was released in Europe on August 23, 2017, and in the United States on September 29, 2017, and also screened at the Deauville Film Festival on September 1, 2017.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nAmerican Made grossed $51.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $83.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $134.9 million, against a production budget of $50 million.In North America, American Made was released alongside the openings of Flatliners and \\'Til Death Do Us Part, as well as the wide expansion of Battle of the Sexes, and was projected to gross $12–15 million from 3,023 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $960,000 from Thursday night previews, the lowest total by a Cruise-led film in recent years, and $6.1 million on its first day. Initially, studio estimates had the film opening to $17 million, finishing third at the box office, behind holdovers It ($17.3 million) and Kingsman: The Golden Circle ($17 million). The following day, actual results had the film debuting to $16.8 million, with Kingsman beating out It by a gross of $16.93 million to $16.90 million. 91% of its opening weekend audience was over the age of 25. In its second weekend, the film grossed $8.1 million (a drop of 51%), finishing 6th.The film was released in 21 countries on August 25, 2017, and grossed a total of $6.1 million over the weekend. It finished number one in 11 of the territories, including the UK, where it replaced five-time champ Dunkirk.\\n\\nCritical response\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 262 reviews, with an average rating of 6.95/10. The site\\'s critical consensus states, \"American Made\\'s fast-and-loose attitude with its real-life story mirrors the cavalier – and delightfully watchable – energy Tom Cruise gives off in the leading role.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on reviews from 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 55% \"definite recommend\".Variety\\'s Guy Lodge wrote: \"A sweat-slicked, exhausting but glibly entertaining escapade on its own terms, American Made is more interesting as a showcase for the dateless elasticity of Cruise’s star power. It feels, for better or worse, like a film he could have made at almost any point in the last 30 years.\"\\nLeslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"This is yet another hyper-competent, boyishly devil-may-care character that offers Cruise, famous for his derring-do on set, a chance to do his own stunts and fly a plane; it’s not a role all that far out of the ageing megastar’s wheelhouse.\"\\n\\nHistorical accuracy\\nDespite the film\\'s suggestion that he was recruited by the CIA while working for TWA, Seal denied in court that he had ever worked for the CIA. Monty Schafer was a fictional character and not based on a real-life CIA agent. A 1996 report by the CIA inspector general acknowledged that the agency had conducted a covert training exercise at the Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport with another federal agency, but found no evidence that the agency had been involved in any illegal activities.Seal was fired from TWA in 1974 for falsely claiming medical leave when he was involved in a smuggling scheme. Seal\\'s connections with cartel bosses were also not direct when he was running his drug operations, and he did not meet Pablo Escobar and the Ochoa brothers in person until 1984, when he was working as an informant for the DEA on an undercover operation, following his arrest.His third wife Deborah, whom Lucy was loosely based on, stated that Seal started his drug smuggling business in 1975, not 1980 like the film suggests, and that it was centered around marijuana before it involved cocaine. Seal\\'s DEA record also noted that he expanded to smuggling cocaine in 1978 and claimed that he was smuggling marijuana as early as 1976. Seal\\'s ties to the Medellín Cartel also began not after being kidnapped while refueling his plane in Colombia, but when he met a smuggler who flew for cartel operative Jorge Ochoa during a flight home from Honduras, where he served nine months in a local jail after being caught smuggling drugs in 1979.When asked by Abraham Riesman of Vulture if the film was a biopic, director Doug Liman said \"You know, we\\'re not making a biopic. Tom Cruise doesn\\'t look like Barry Seal. His character is inspired by the stories we learned about Barry.\" It has been noted the real Seal was not of Tom Cruise\\'s 5-foot-7 frame and was an obese man who reportedly weighed 300 pounds. Liman has also acknowledged that the film\\'s zero-gravity love scene was his idea and that he received the inspiration for it after he and Cruise collided in the cockpit while filming a flight scene.Seal was unapologetic about his weapons and drug smuggling operations, even stating once in a television interview, \"Whether you call it soldier of fortune or what, it\\'s a way of life for me. I enjoy it and I\\'m going to keep doing it.\" He also never crash-landed into a suburban neighborhood. Liman has described the film as \"a fun lie based on a true story.\"\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nAmerican Made at IMDb',\n",
              " 'Andrew Morton (writer)': 'Andrew David Morton (born 1953) is an English journalist and writer who has published biographies of royal figures such as Diana, Princess of Wales, and celebrity subjects including Tom Cruise, Madonna, Angelina Jolie and Monica Lewinsky; several of his books have been unauthorised and contain contested assertions.\\n\\nEarly life and career\\nMorton was born and raised in Dewsbury, West Riding of Yorkshire, where his father ran a picture framing business. He attended Leeds Grammar School and Sussex University where he studied history. After university, Morton became a tabloid journalist and worked for three London tabloids, the Daily Star, News of the World, and Daily Mail, until 1987.\\n\\nBiography of Diana, Princess of Wales\\nAndrew Morton wrote a biography of Diana, Princess of Wales called Diana: Her True Story. In 1993 it was made into a television film of the same name, with Serena Scott Thomas as Princess Diana. Following Diana\\'s death in August 1997, Morton issued an edition entitled Diana: Her True Story in Her Own Words in October.\\n\\nBiography of Monica Lewinsky\\nMorton received public attention after Diana\\'s death, when he revealed the extent of her collaborations with him. He achieved greater prominence in the United States after the publication of Monica\\'s Story.\\n\\nTom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography\\nTom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography was published in January 2008, and reprinted with an update in February 2009. In a review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin writes \"Mr. Morton has found a number of former Scientologists who are willing to speak freely, and in some cases vengefully, about the group\\'s purported inner workings. Mr. Morton\\'s eagerness to include their voices leads him to push the limits of responsible reporting.\" Maslin adds that Morton \"provides a credible portrait extrapolated from the actor\\'s on-the-record remarks and highly visible public behavior.\"\\nWriting in Entertainment Weekly, Mark Harris gives the book a grade of \"C-\", and says \"Cruise emerges from Morton\\'s takedown moderately scratched but as uncracked as ever.\" Another review in The New York Times by Ada Calhooun stated:However shady Scientology may be, Morton\\'s language in Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography is extreme. He and his sources compare the church and its leadership to fascists, the Roman Empire, storm troopers, Machiavelli, Orwell’s Animal Farm, Napoleon, Stalinists and North Korea. He also repeatedly invokes Nazism, and quotes without censure the German Protestant Church’s comparison of Cruise to Joseph Goebbels.\\nTeresa Budasi of the Chicago Sun-Times describes the book as \"fascinating\", although Budasi also raises a \"question as to what\\'s true and what isn’t.\" Budasi sums up her impression of the work, writing \"Morton\\'s book is as much an indictment on Cruise\\'s chosen faith as it is the life story of one of the world\\'s biggest movie stars. And by the end you realize that \\'Scientologist\\' is what will end up being the role of his lifetime.\" In a review in The Buffalo News, Jeff Simon writes of the author: \"To give Morton the credit he’s clearly due: he is one of the best around at constructing a 250-page gossip column.\"Upon its publication, Cruise\\'s lawyer and the Church of Scientology released statements questioning the truthfulness of assertions made by Morton in the book. In a 15-page statement released to the press, the Church of Scientology calls the book \"a bigoted, defamatory assault replete with lies\". The book was not published in the UK, Australia, or New Zealand due to strict libel laws in those countries.\\n\\nBiography of Prince William and Catherine Middleton\\nOn 16 November 2010, Prince William announced his engagement to Catherine Middleton. Morton was commissioned by Michael O\\'Mara Books to write a book to coincide with the royal wedding on 29 April 2011. The book, which went on sale on 3 May 2011 in the UK, includes a detailed biography of Prince William, as well as details of his relationship with Catherine Middleton. The book features full-colour photos of Prince William and the couple, as well as a detailed section on the wedding itself.\\n\\nOther publications\\nAfter Monica\\'s Story, Morton investigated a mining disaster, which led to his first non-royal journalistic account, Nine for Nine: The Pennsylvania Mine Rescue Miracle. He also wrote an authorised biography of Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi. The book resulted in a libel case brought against Morton by a Kenyan judge – Morton lost the case and was ordered to pay £45,700 in damages. Morton then moved on to the \"king and queen of pop culture\", as he termed them, David Beckham and his wife Victoria. Posh and Becks became a No. 1 best-seller in the UK, but received little attention in the United States.Soon after, Morton announced that he would be taking on the \"queen of pop\", Madonna. Despite a seven-figure advance by St. Martin\\'s Press and a 500,000-copy first printing, Madonna failed to make waves in North America, where it spent only two weeks on The New York Times best-seller list (peaking at No. 8). By contrast, J. Randy Taraborrelli\\'s Madonna: An Intimate Biography, released at the same time, became a massive best-seller in the United Kingdom (although it only made The New York Times extended best-seller list). Morton subsequently wrote another Diana book titled In Pursuit of Love, with information that he had left unaddressed, which made The New York Times best-seller list.Morton also wrote an unauthorized biography of Angelina Jolie. Janet Maslin highlighted the lack of sources noted in the book in a review in The New York Times, saying \"the people most eager to tell him about Ms. Jolie are people who don’t know her, so that the book is shrink-wrapped in glib insights from dubious psychiatric talents\". Allen Barra described it as \"the worst book in the 21st century so far\" in a Salon review which summarized the book as \"ill-informed, moralistic and just plain mean\".In April 2018, he published Meghan: A Hollywood Princess about Meghan Markle, who married Prince Harry a month later in May 2018.\\n\\nWorks\\nDiana: Her True Story in Her Own Words.

During an after party, Basil Exposition informs Austin that Nigel has been kidnapped and the only clue is that the crew of his yacht have had their genitalia painted gold.\\nAustin visits the imprisoned Dr. Evil who antagonizes him by reminding Austin that his father was also absent when he was given the title of \"International Man of Mystery\" during their British Intelligence academy graduation; an event that angered Dr. Evil due to him being the top of the class. He tells him that Goldmember is behind the abduction so Austin time travels to 1975 and infiltrates Goldmember\\'s roller disco club. He is reunited with his former lover, FBI agent Foxxy Cleopatra who is undercover. Austin locates his father but is unable to rescue him and Goldmember takes Nigel through Dr. Evil\\'s time machine to 2002. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me instigate a riot in their prison, allowing them to escape. A British Intelligence mole named Number 3 informs Austin that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair near Tokyo.\\nAustin, accompanied by Foxxy, travels to Tokyo and they confront Fat Bastard, who is now a Sumo wrestler. Fat Bastard reveals that businessman Mr. Roboto is working on a device for Dr. Evil and Goldmember. Austin and Foxxy meet with Roboto, who pleads ignorance. Austin and Foxxy infiltrate Roboto\\'s factory where the command unit for the tractor beam is being loaded in Goldmember\\'s car, and Roboto gives Goldmember a golden key needed to activate the beam. Foxxy confronts Goldmember while Austin attempts to free Nigel, but Goldmember escapes and flees to Dr. Evil\\'s submarine. Scott Evil presents Dr. Evil with sharks with laser beams attached to their heads, a request that had gone unfulfilled previously. Roboto then dies when Scott causes him to fall into the shark pool. Dr. Evil replaces Mini-Me with Scott as his favored son and the rejected clone defects and joins Austin and Foxxy.\\nThe trio infiltrate the submarine but Austin is captured. Dr. Evil prepares to activate the tractor beam, but Foxxy steals the key and frees Austin. Austin prepares to shoot Dr. Evil, when Nigel appears and reveals that Austin and Dr. Evil are brothers. Confused, Dr. Evil explains that his parents died in a car accident and he was brought up by evil Belgians, but Nigel reveals that the explosion came from an assassination attempt and he thought that only Austin survived. Dr. Evil (revealed to be named Dougie), Austin, Nigel, and Mini-Me embrace; enraging Scott, who leaves to pursue his own vengeance while Goldmember commandeers the tractor beam\\'s controls, unzipping his trousers to reveal his gold-covered genitalia to be a spare key. Goldmember activates the tractor beam, but Austin and Dr. Evil work together to reverse its polarity, destroying the meteor and saving the world. \\nGoldmember turns to the camera to reveal the entire story was adapted into a film called \"Austinpussy\" and was directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Cruise as Austin, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, Danny DeVito as Mini-Me, and John Travolta as Goldmember. Upon exiting the cinema, Austin and Foxxy encounter Fat Bastard, now thin but with sagging flesh thanks to the Subway diet. As Austin and Foxxy kiss, Scott Evil – now completely bald, dressed and behaving as his father, declares he will get his revenge against Austin before dancing like Michael Jackson. During the end credits, Mini-Me is shown talking with Britney Spears, and she asks him if she can give him her mobile phone number.\\n\\nCast\\nMike Myers as Austin Powers, a British agent.\\nAaron Himelstein as young Austin PowersMyers\\' other roles in the film include:\\nDr. Evil, a Belgian supervillain and Austin Powers’ nemesis and long-lost twin brother.\\nJosh Zuckerman as young Dr. Evil\\nGoldmember, a Dutch supervillain, henchman of Dr. Evil and the main antagonist of the film.\\nFat Bastard, a Scottish former Ministry of Defence soldier who now works as a Japanese sumo wrestler.Beyoncé Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra, Austin\\'s new sidekick and Goldmember\\'s rival\\nMichael York as Basil Exposition, Austin\\'s boss\\nEddie Adams as young Basil Exposition\\nMichael Caine as Nigel Powers a British agent and Austin and Dr. Evil\\'s father\\nScott Aukerman as young Nigel Powers\\nRobert Wagner as Number 2, Dr. Evil\\'s henchman\\nRob Lowe as Middle Number 2\\nEvan Farmer as Young Number 2\\nSeth Green as Scott Evil, Dr. Evil\\'s son\\nVerne Troyer as Mini-Me, Dr. Evil\\'s mini clone\\nMindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina, Dr. Evil\\'s wife\\nFred Savage as Number Three / Mole\\nBrian Tee as Godzilla Pedestrian\\nMasi Oka as Godzilla Copyright Pedestrian\\nClint Howard as Radar Operator Johnson Ritter\\nMichael McDonald as Royal Guard\\nDonna D\\'Errico as Female Vendor\\nFred Stoller as Melon Guy\\nGreg Grunberg as the shirtless fan with the letter \"T\" (Greg\\'s brother Brad Grunberg is the fan with the \"A\")\\nKinga Philipps as Mrs. Powers\\nKevin Stea as Assistant Director of \"Austinpussy\" / Dancer\\nAnna-Marie Goddard, Nina Kaczorowski, and Nikki Ziering as henchwomen\\nMing Tea as Themselves\\nRachel Roberts as The Model\\nSusanna Hoffs as Gillian Shagwell\\nMatthew Sweet as Sid Belvedere\\nChristopher Ward as Trevor Algberth\\nCarrie Ann Inaba as Fook Yu\\nDiane Mizota as Fook Mi\\nTom Lister Jr. as Prisoner #2\\nKristen Johnston as Dancer at Austin\\'s pad\\nNeil Mullarkey as Physician\\nNobu Matsuhisa as Mr. Roboto\\nPeter Tuiasosopo as Sumo Wrestler with Beard\\n\\nCameos\\nTom Cruise as Himself as Austin Powers (During Austinpussy)\\nDanny DeVito as Himself as Mini-Me (During Austinpussy)\\nGwyneth Paltrow as Herself as Dixie Normous (During Austinpussy)\\nKevin Spacey as Himself as Dr. Evil (During Austinpussy)\\nSteven Spielberg as Himself\\nQuincy Jones as Himself\\nJohn Travolta as Himself as Goldmember (During the Austinpussy ending)\\nBritney Spears (During the opening credits) as a Fembot posing as herself (During the \"Boys\" music video) and (During the end credits) as herself talking with Mini-Me\\nOzzy Osbourne as Himself\\nSharon Osbourne as Herself\\nKelly Osbourne as Herself\\nJack Osbourne as Himself\\nWillie Nelson as Himself\\nBurt Bacharach (During the end credits) as Himself\\nNathan Lane as Mysterious Disco Man\\nSpencer Kayden as Jenny\\nKatie Couric as Georgia State Prison guard\\n\\nProduction\\nTitle concerns\\nThe title of the film, Goldmember, led to legal action being taken by MGM, the distributors of the James Bond film franchise, that briefly led to the film\\'s title being removed from promotional material and trailers. The dispute was quickly resolved and the film title remained unchanged on the provision that the film would include trailers in its cinema releases for the then-upcoming James Bond film, Die Another Day, and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.\\n\\nCharacters\\nAustin Powers (Myers), having conquered the 1990s and the 1960s, travels back to the 1970s and teams up with his nemesis Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) to thwart a new villain, Goldmember (Myers once again). Myers also plays Fat Bastard for the second time, this time parodying the kind of \"wire fight\" seen in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film also stars Beyoncé Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra (parodying blaxploitation heroines, primarily Foxy Brown and Cleopatra Jones, as well as Christie Love when she says, \"You\\'re under arrest, sugah!\"), Michael York, reprising the role of Basil Exposition, and Verne Troyer in his second appearance as Mini-Me. The film also introduced a new character named Number 3 (a.k.a. the Mole), who is portrayed by former child star Fred Savage. Clint Howard plays a radar operator in all three films. Michael Caine guest stars as Austin\\'s father, Nigel; this role was inspired by the character of Harry Palmer from The Ipcress File, a 1965 film starring Caine.Four actors who appeared in the earlier films play different characters in Goldmember. Rob Lowe, who played the friend of a dead guard in International Man of Mystery, reprises his role as a younger Number 2 from The Spy Who Shagged Me, while Neil Mullarkey (quartermaster clerk in International Man of Mystery) and Eric Winzenried (army private soldier in The Spy Who Shagged Me) appear as the Physician and Henchman Sailor in the Sick Bay. Michael McDonald (the Virtucon guard who got run over by a steamroller in International Man of Mystery and a NATO soldier in The Spy Who Shagged Me) appears as the royal guard.\\n\\nGoldmember\\nJohan van der Smut, better known as Goldmember, is a fictional villain played by Myers (John Travolta plays the character in a cameo at the end of the film). The name was inspired by the James Bond villain Auric Goldfinger. Goldmember\\'s Dutch origins and character traits were, according to Myers, inspired by an episode of the HBO TV series Real Sex featuring a Dutchman who operated a \"sex barn\" north of Rotterdam. The man\\'s distinct forms of expression caught Myers\\' attention while he was writing.\\n\\nRelease\\nBox office\\nAustin Powers in Goldmember took in £5,585,978 in the United Kingdom on its opening weekend. In the United States, it broke the opening weekend record for a spoof movie, surpassing the previous Austin Powers film. The film grossed US$73 million on its opening weekend, and grossed a total of $213 million in the United States, according to Box Office Mojo.\\n\\nHome media\\nAustin Powers in Goldmember was released on video and DVD on December 3, 2002. The DVD was released under the Infinifilm label, and was re-packed in 2011 as part of the Austin Powers 3 Film Collection\\n\\nCritical reception\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a rating of 54%, based on 184 reviews, with the site\\'s critical consensus reading, \"While the narrative structure is messy and doesn\\'t make much sense, the third installment of the Austin Powers franchise contains enough inspired bits to entertain.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\\nMyers was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for the third time, but lost against Daveigh Chase for her role as Samara Morgan in The Ring, making it the first time Myers lost the award. However, he did win the award for Best Comedic Performance, making it the first time he won the award, having previously lost twice for the first two films.\\n\\nAwards\\nSoundtrack\\nThe song \"Hey Goldmember\" interpolates and is a parody of four 1970s disco songs formed into a medley; \"Sing a Song\" by Earth, Wind & Fire, \"Get Down Tonight\", \"(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty\", and \"That\\'s the Way (I Like It)\", all by KC and the Sunshine Band.\\n\"Sing a Song\" is not listed in the credits but is sung by Beyoncé at the beginning.\\n\\nTrack listing\\n\"Work It Out\" – Beyoncé\\n\"Miss You\" (Dr. Dre Remix 2002) – The Rolling Stones\\n\"Boys\" (Co-Ed Remix) – Britney Spears featuring Pharrell Williams\\n\"Groove Me\" – Angie Stone\\n\"Shining Star\" – Earth, Wind & Fire\\n\"Hey Goldmember\" – Foxxy Cleopatra featuring Devin and Solange (samples \"(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty\" by KC and the Sunshine Band)\\n\"Ain\\'t No Mystery\" – Smash Mouth\\n\"Evil Woman\" – Soul Hooligan featuring Diana King\\n\"1975\" – Paul Oakenfold (samples \"A Fifth of Beethoven\" by Walter Murphy)\\n\"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\" (Dr. Evil Remix) – Dr. Evil\\n\"Daddy Wasn\\'t There\" – Ming Tea featuring Austin Powers\\n\"Alfie (What\\'s It All About, Austin?)\" – Susanna Hoffs\\n\\nCharts\\nPossible sequel\\nIn October 2005, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Mike Myers discussed the possibility of studio sources moving forward with a fourth film. \"There is hope!\". \"We\\'re all circling and talking to each other. I miss doing the characters.\" In May 2007, in an interview with IGN, \"So no more Austin Powers?\" was asked, and Myers replied, \"No, no, there is a fully conceived idea for a fourth and I can just say that it\\'s from Dr. Evil\\'s point of view. So if you balanced how much of it was Austin with Dr. Evil, it\\'s more about Dr. Evil than Austin\". Also, in the audio commentary from the DVD release of Goldmember, Myers revealed that in the fourth film, Fat Bastard would return and regain the weight that he lost in Goldmember.In May 2007, at the Shrek the Third premiere, Mike Myers announced that a fourth Austin Powers film was planned, but that it would focus more on Dr. Evil rather than Austin. He also said that he\\'d start work on it after he started work on The Love Guru, which became a box office bomb. In February 2008, it was announced that Jay Roach would return as director. In April 2008, it was reported that Gisele Bündchen had been offered a role in the film. However, Seth Green, who played Scott Evil, stated that there was no script at the moment and that Austin Powers 4 would be made if a script is written and approved. In June 2008, in an interview, when asked about another Austin Powers film, Myers stated, \"I have an idea, and again it\\'s one of those things that will emerge or it won\\'t.\" In July 2008, Mike Myers stated that he had begun writing Austin Powers 4, and that the plot is \"really about Dr. Evil and his son.\"In March 2010, Jay Roach indicated to MTV that Myers is working on ideas for a fourth film. In August 2011, Mike Myers revealed he would return, and had begun writing a script for a fourth installment. In September 2013, when asked about the future of Austin Powers, Myers answered \"I\\'m still figuring that out.\" In September 2015, Verne Troyer expressed his desire to return as Mini-Me if he was asked to do so.In May 2016, Roach was asked about the fourth Austin Powers film during an interview with Larry King, and he stated the ideas for the fourth film that he and Myers have are good and interesting. In August 2016, in a telephone interview, Mike Myers stated \"Everything is being negotiated and worked out and all that stuff\" in regards to the fourth installment of the Austin Powers film series.In April 2017, as the twentieth anniversary approached for Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Mike Myers claimed he would love to do another Austin Powers film, but audiences would \"just have to see\". Two days later, Roach stated that a fourth film would only occur if Myers creates a good story for it. In May 2017, Troyer stated that Mini-Me will reveal that he can speak in the fourth movie. However, Troyer died on April 21, 2018, delaying production of a fourth film and precluding him from reprising his role as Mini-Me. In May 2018, Myers reiterated his interest in making a fourth Austin Powers, stating that it would be fun, also hinting that some tribute to Troyer might be included. In November 2018, Myers stated that the project\\'s future is \"looking good\" with the script already written and that Austin Powers and Dr. Evil will return soon, citing his parenthood as the reason for how long the production has lasted and that Roach will most likely reprise his directorial duties.In January 2020, Jay Roach again indicated that he was interested in doing a fourth film.\\n\\nSee also\\nOutline of James Bond\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nAustin Powers in Goldmember at IMDb\\nAustin Powers in Goldmember at Box Office Mojo\\nAustin Powers in Goldmember at Rotten Tomatoes\\nAustin Powers in Goldmember at Metacritic',\n",
              " 'Barry Seal': 'Adler Berriman \"Barry\" Seal (July 16, 1939 – February 19, 1986) was a commercial airline pilot who became a major drug smuggler for the Medellín Cartel. When Seal was convicted of smuggling charges, he became an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration and testified in several major drug trials. He was murdered in 1986 by contract killers hired by the cartel.\\n\\nEarly life\\nBarry Seal was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the son of Mary Lou (née Delcambre) and Benjamin Kurtis Seal, a candy wholesaler. Seal began to fly as a teenager, earning a student pilot certificate at 16 and a private pilot\\'s certificate at 17. His flight instructor described him as a naturally gifted pilot.In 1962, Seal enlisted in the Louisiana Army National Guard for six years: six months of active duty, followed by five and a half years of inactive duty. Seal\\'s active duty began in July 1962. He was assigned to the 20th Special Forces Group and graduated from the United States Army Airborne School but never completed Special Forces selection and training. His non-active duty was served in the 245th Engineer Battalion, where his MOS was radio telephone operator.\\n\\nEarly career\\nIn 1964, Seal joined TWA as a flight engineer and was soon promoted to the first officer, then captain, flying a Boeing 707 on a regular Western Europe route. He was one of the youngest 707 command pilots in the TWA fleet. Seal\\'s career with TWA ended in July 1972, when he was arrested for involvement in a conspiracy to smuggle a shipment of plastic explosives to Mexico using a DC-4. The case was eventually dismissed in 1974 for prosecutorial misconduct, but in the meantime, TWA fired Seal, who had falsely taken medical leave to participate in the scheme.\\n\\nDrug smuggling career\\nSeal admitted that he started smuggling small amounts of marijuana by air in early 1976. By 1978, he had expanded to flying significant loads of cocaine, pound-for-pound a much more profitable enterprise than marijuana smuggling.Ironically, Seal\\'s operations received an important boost when he was arrested and jailed in Honduras on the return leg of a drug-smuggling trip to Ecuador. Seal made important connections while in prison in Honduras, including Emile Camp, a fellow Louisiana pilot and smuggler who became one of Seal\\'s closest associates, and Ellis McKenzie, a local Honduran smuggler. Also, after his release from prison Seal met William Roger Reaves on the flight back to the U.S. It was Reaves who provided Seal with his first connection to the Medellín cartel.To expand his smuggling capacity, Seal also hired William Bottoms, his ex-brother-in-law, as a pilot. From 1980 on, Bottoms was the main pilot in Seal\\'s smuggling enterprise, often flying with Camp while Seal oversaw planning and operations.In 1981, Seal began smuggling cocaine for the Medellín Cartel. At his peak, he earned as much as $500,000 per flight transporting shipments of cocaine from Colombia to the United States.Seal\\'s smuggling method was to use low-flying planes and airdrop drug packages in remote areas of Louisiana. They were then picked up by Seal\\'s ground team and transported to the Colombian distributors in Florida. By 1982, Seal was using over a dozen aircraft in his smuggling operation. The number of planes and the frequency of flights soon attracted the attention of Louisiana State Police and Federal investigators.To avoid this unwanted attention, Seal moved his aircraft to Mena Intermountain Regional Airport in Mena, Arkansas, where he did maintenance and modifications to improve the planes\\' carrying capacity and avionics. Seal\\'s activities in Mena later became the subject of rumor and controversy, but according to Seal\\'s biographer, former FBI agent Del Hahn, Seal did not use Mena as a drug transshipment point.\\n\\nFlorida indictments and convictions\\nBy 1981, DEA agents in Florida were aware of Seal\\'s smuggling activities. In April 1981, a DEA informant introduced Seal to an undercover DEA agent. After several months of contacts, the agent negotiated a deal with Seal to smuggle 1,200 pounds of methaqualone tablets into the United States (the tablets were counterfeits, made of chalk). The investigation into Seal was part of a major undercover operation called Operation Screamer in which over 80 pilots were eventually indicted. Two indictments were returned against Seal in March 1983. The first indictment charged Seal alone with two counts of conspiracy to distribute methaqualone. The second indictment charged Seal and three others with multiple counts of possession and distribution of methaqualone, phenobarbital, and meperidine.Seal surrendered to federal authorities at the end of April 1983 and attempted to make a deal, first with the Florida task force, then with the Baton Rouge task force. Both rejected any deals, even though Seal told them a little about his involvement with the Ochoa family.  Without a deal, Seal was tried in February 1984 and after a month-long trial was convicted on all the counts in the first indictment.\\n\\nSeal becomes an informant\\nFacing a heavy sentence, and having been rejected by regional drug task forces in both Florida and Louisiana, Seal decided to try contacting the Vice President\\'s Drug Task Force, a special program in the office of then-Vice President George Bush. The office referred Seal to DEA headquarters, which assigned DEA agent Ernst Jacobsen to debrief Seal and evaluate his potential as an informant. Jacobsen was impressed with Seal\\'s connections, especially the ones with the Ochoa family, and on March 28, Seal signed a letter agreeing to serve as a DEA informant. Seal then pleaded guilty to the second indictment in Florida and was released with his sentence to depend on his performance as an informant.The Florida Task Force plan called for Seal to set up a cocaine purchase with the Ochoas and other cartel members, providing the basis for indictments in the U.S. Seal had previously dealt with the cartel through another associate so that they were unaware of his real name. Through his cartel contacts in Miami, Seal arranged a meeting using the name Ellis McKenzie (the real name of another Seal associate). He flew down to Medellín for the meeting on April 8, accompanied by a Miami based cartel pilot who was unaware of Seal\\'s role as an informant.\\n\\nUndercover work in Nicaragua\\nParticipants at the meeting included Pablo Escobar and Jorge, Fabio Jr., and Juan David Ochoa. The Colombian government had recently conducted a major raid on the cartel\\'s manufacturing facilities at a remote jungle location called Tranquilandia, and they told Seal that they were making arrangements to set up shipping and production facilities in Nicaragua, where they had struck a deal with the Sandinista government.These arrangements were not yet complete, so Seal\\'s first shipment was to be a direct flight to the U.S.  Originally planned for mid-April, the flight did not take place until the end of May. When it did take place, the overloaded plane crashed at the Colombia airfield on takeoff. The cartel provided a new plane, but it lacked the capacity for a direct flight to the U.S., so the cartel arranged a stopover in Nicaragua earlier than planned, at an airfield in Los Brasiles near Managua. After refueling, Seal left Los Brasiles flying without lights, and when he came close to Managua, he was fired on by Nicaraguan military units. The plane was hit and Seal had to make an emergency landing at Sandino International Airport in Managua. The drugs were unloaded from the plane by the military and Seal and his co-pilot were taken to detention in downtown Managua, where they were released to the cartel\\'s Nicaraguan contact, Federico Vaughan. Vaughan was an aide to Tomas Borge, Nicaraguan Minister of the Interior.In Managua, Seal met again with Pablo Escobar, who was setting up a cocaine lab for production. After a discussion about how to move the increased flow of cocaine, Escobar decided to keep the first shipment in Nicaragua and have Seal return to the States and buy a larger plane.The plane Seal acquired was a C-123K, a large aircraft used primarily for military transport. Before returning to Nicaragua, the DEA arranged for CIA technicians to install hidden cameras inside the plane.Seal returned to the Los Brasiles airfield in Nicaragua on June 25. The pickup went as planned this time, and the cameras successfully photographed Seal and several Nicaraguan soldiers loading cocaine onto the plane, aided by Pablo Escobar, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha (another important cartel member), and Federico Vaughan. On his return to the U.S. Seal landed the plane at Homestead Air Force Base and the drugs were transferred into a Winnebago camper, which Seal turned over to his Colombian contact.The drugs could not be allowed to be distributed, and the immediate arrest of those handling the vehicle would suggest to the Colombians that Seal had betrayed them, so DEA agents staged an accident with the camper, allowing the driver to escape. Unfortunately, the driver was arrested by local police, and the circumstances of the seizure raised the suspicions of the cartel.Seal made one more trip to Nicaragua on July 7, bringing money to Escobar to pay the Nicaraguans for landing rights. Another shipment was also planned at this time, but under instructions from the DEA, Seal told Escobar his landing site was under DEA surveillance and unsafe for transport, to avoid the need to seize a second load. The DEA felt this would be impossible to explain away, and Seal returned to the U.S. without a cargo.The DEA plan was to keep Seal working with the cartel on other parts of the supply chain, such as moving cocaine base into Nicaragua from Colombia and inspecting smuggling airfields in Mexico and the U.S. The ultimate hope was to arrest the cartel leaders in a jurisdiction where it would be easy to extract them.However, the Nicaragua undercover operation came to an end soon after Seal\\'s return from his second trip when it was exposed in the press. A leak regarding the operation came before Seal\\'s second trip. On June 29, Gen. Paul Gorman, U.S. Military Commander Southern Command, made a speech revealing that the U.S. had evidence that elements of the Nicaraguan government were involved in drug smuggling, though Gorman did not mention Seal or the undercover flights. It is not clear whether Seal and his crew were informed of this leak before they returned to Nicaragua.A fuller account of U.S. efforts in Nicaragua appeared on July 17 in an article by reporter Edmond Jacoby, published on the front page of the Washington Times. Although not a complete account, it gave enough information to spell an end to Seal\\'s work with the cartel, and to the DEA\\'s hopes of capturing the cartel outside Colombia.\\n\\nUndercover work in the U.S.\\nFollowing the exposure of the Nicaraguan investigation, the DEA had to move quickly to arrest the cartel distributors in Miami. The DEA had been informed before the publication of the Jacoby article, so they were still able to have Seal set up a meeting with the chief cartel supervisor in Miami, Carlos Bustamonte, and arrested him on July 17, along with other cartel employees.The evidence acquired from the arrest, plus the evidence gathered by Seal, provided the basis for the first drug trafficking indictment in the U.S. against Escobar and the Ochoas.Despite the exposure, Seal was able to put together a second major undercover operation for the DEA later that year. This operation involved a long, complicated cocaine shipment from Bolivia, refueling in Colombia, refueling again in Texas, and delivering the cocaine in Las Vegas. The DEA refused to let Seal leave the country due to the danger he was in, so Seal arranged for his ex-brother-in-law William Bottoms to make the flight. The flight, in January 1985, was successful and led to arrests and convictions.In February, Seal also played a central role in an undercover operation against Norman Saunders, chief minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands, a former British colony south of the Bahamas. Saunders was videotaped paying a bribe to Seal in Miami, and was also successfully prosecuted.\\n\\nContinuing legal problems\\nWhile Seal had come to an agreement with the DEA and the Florida drug task force in March 1984, he was still under active investigation by state and federal authorities in Baton Rouge, LA, and Little Rock, AR. In October 1984, a grand jury in Louisiana was convened and began interviewing witnesses against Seal. Seal attempted to push back against the investigation by appearing in a television news series broadcast by WBRZ in Baton Rouge in November 1984. The series, titled \"Uncle Sam Wants You\", ran on five consecutive evenings. It included an interview where Seal denied he was a smuggler and depicted Seal as harassed by the government. The state narcotics agents who were investigating Seal in Baton Rouge sued over their depiction in the series, but the lawsuit was dismissed.Soon after the broadcast, the heads of the Florida and Louisiana task forces met to work out an agreement that would allow Seal to continue working with the Florida task force and testify as a witness at trial. They agreed to a sentence for Seal\\'s Louisiana activities no greater than the sentence he received for his Florida smuggling, with both sentences to run concurrently.\\n\\nContract on Seal\\nSeal was originally introduced to the Medellín cartel members as a pilot named Ellis McKenzie. Although the newspaper report and the arrest of their Miami distributors confirmed that their pilot was DEA, it was not until the cartel members received a copy of Seal\\'s television documentary that they learned McKenzie was Seal. They put out a contract to kidnap or murder Seal. \\nMax Mermelstein, a high-level cartel distributor in Miami, later testified in court that he was shown the documentary a few days after it was broadcast and was told that the cartel wanted Seal either captured or killed: the price was $500,000 if Seal was killed, and $1,000,000 if he was captured alive. Mermelstein testified that he accepted the contract, believing that a refusal would mean death. He received a phone call from Fabio Ochoa and Escobar, who both thanked him for his help, and was given $100,000 for any costs he incurred. Before Mermelstein had located Seal, however, he was arrested by a federal task force in June 1985. He soon told the task force about the contract, and Seal was informed that the cartel was offering $500,000 for his death.\\n\\nSeal in court\\nSeal was taken into federal custody in June 1985 and spent several months testifying in court. He was the primary witness in three trials: the trial of Saunders and the other Turks and Caicos officials in July; the trial of the cartel distributors in Miami in August; the trial of the cartel distributors who had arranged the shipment of cocaine from Bolivia to Las Vegas, also in August. All three trials resulted in convictions for all defendants. Seal also made a public appearance before the President\\'s Commission on Organized Crime, recounting his experiences as a drug smuggler.\\n\\nSentencing in Florida\\nFollowing his testimony in the Miami trials, Seal appeared in Florida court again over his second indictment in the Big Screamer operation. Although Seal had pleaded guilty, with the support of his DEA supervisors, he was sentenced to five years of unsupervised probation. Following his testimony in Las Vegas, Seal spent another month in a witness protection center. In October 1985 he returned to court over the first indictment in Big Screamer, for which he had originally been sentenced to ten years. After listening to summaries of Seal\\'s successful work for the DEA, Judge Norman Roettger sentenced Seal to time served (a little over three months in witness protection) and three years probation.\\n\\nSentencing in Louisiana\\nWhen Seal received only time served and probation, Louisiana state and federal drug investigators were faced with a dilemma. They had anticipated Seal would serve substantial time in Florida and were now bound by the agreement Florida and Louisiana drug task forces had made in December 1984. The Florida sentence meant no jail time for Seal in Louisiana, yet Seal was pleading guilty to buying 200 kilograms of cocaine, already more serious than the Florida charges. Also, before the agreement was reached, the Louisiana task force investigation had been looking into Seal\\'s involvement in smuggling thousands of kilograms of cocaine.At Seal\\'s sentencing hearing in January 1986, Judge Frank Polozola acknowledged that he was bound by the agreement, but informed Seal and his lawyer of his dissatisfaction with Seal\\'s failure to receive jail time in Florida, forcing Polozola to sentence Seal to probation on much more serious charges in Louisiana. He warned Seal that he intended to set strict probation provisions and that if Seal violated these, the plea bargain could be revoked and Seal re-sentenced.The probation conditions prohibited Seal from leaving Baton Rouge without written permission from Judge Polozola, who banned Seal from employing armed security personnel, and ordered him to spend every night at a halfway house for the first six months of his probation. Seal was assigned to the Salvation Army\\'s Community Treatment Center in Baton Rouge.\\n\\nSeal\\'s murder\\nOn the evening of February 19, 1986, Seal was shot to death in front of the Salvation Army Center, three weeks into his probation. When Seal pulled into the house\\'s lot and parked, a man got out of a car behind the center\\'s donation drop boxes and opened fire with a suppressed MAC-10 submachine gun. Seal was hit six times and died instantly.Six Colombians were quickly arrested in connection with the murder. Three of them, Luis Carlos Quintero-Cruz, Miguel Vélez, and Bernardo Antonio Vásquez, were indicted on state charges for capital murder. A fourth man was indicted separately on lesser charges, and evidence of direct involvement was insufficient for two, who were released and deported.In addition to the state charges against the killers, federal charges were filed against Fabio Ochoa, Pablo Escobar, and a third cartel member, Rafael Cardona, for conspiring to violate Seal\\'s civil rights by murdering him.\\n\\nThe murder trial\\nWidespread publicity and the general public outcry caused a delay of several months before Seal\\'s murder trial began. It proved impossible to impanel sufficient jurors in Baton Rouge, so the venue was moved to Lake Charles. The trial began in April 1987. The most important witnesses were Max Mermelstein and Luis Carlos Uribe-Munera.\\nMermelstein, who had told the DEA of the murder contract after his arrest in 1985, testified that Ochoa, Escobar, and Cardona had asked him to take the contract and provided him with money and weapons to do the job. He had seen Cardona test-fire the murder weapon in Mermelstein\\'s garage and bullets that matched the murder weapon were later extracted from the garage wall by FBI forensics. Mermelstein also knew the defendant Vélez. He testified that Vélez was present when he was given the contract and that Vélez later asked Mermelstein to turn the contract over to him.Uribe-Munera was a Colombian drug smuggler for the cartel. He testified that in January 1986, he was ordered by Jorge Ochoa to kill Seal. When he learned that he would probably be killed afterward, he refused. He was then shot five times by cartel gunmen, but survived and eventually sought asylum at the U.S. embassy in Bogota. He was brought to the U. S. where he agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine.There was also extensive eyewitness and forensic evidence against Quintero-Cruz, Vélez, and Vásquez. A witness identified Vélez as the driver of the vehicle in the halfway house parking lot. Another eyewitness saw Quintero-Cruz outside the car, handing the MAC-10 to the car driver through the window after the murder. All three men\\'s fingerprints were found in the vehicle. Vasquez was identified as the purchaser of the halfway house vehicle by the car agency salesman and paid for hotel rooms and rental cars using his name. All three were found guilty and sentenced to life without parole.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nSeal was married three times. His first marriage, to Barbara Dodson, lasted from 1963 to 1971. The second marriage, to Lynn Ross, lasted from 1971 to 1972. In 1973, he married Deborah DuBois. The marriage ended with his death in 1986. Seal had 6 children; 2 from his first wife,  one from a relationship he had in between marriages, and three more with Debbie.\\n\\nControversies\\nSeal\\'s career as a smuggler and an informant, and his later violent death, has led to several controversies.\\n\\nExposure of the Nicaraguan undercover operation\\nIn 1988, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing that looked into how Seal\\'s 1984 trip to Nicaragua was leaked to the press. Questioned about the identity of the source, DEA agent Ernst Jacobson replied, \"I heard that the leak came from an aide in the White House\". He stated that Iran–Contra figure Oliver North had attended two meetings about the sting operation and had the motivation to release the information. UPI reported: \"By linking the Sandinistas with drug traffic ... aid to the rebels accused of human rights violations might seem more palatable\". \\nSubcommittee chairman William J. Hughes strongly suggested that North was the source of the leak, but Representative Bill McCollum said, \"...we don\\'t know who leaked this. No one has been able to tell us\". Citing testimony of DEA Administrator John C. Lawn, the report of the Kerry Committee released in December 1988 pinned the leak on North stating he \"decided to play politics with the issue\". In an interview with Frontline, North said he was told by his superiors on the National Security Council to brief Senator Paula Hawkins about the operation, but he denied leaking the report. Hawkins told Frontline that neither she nor her staff leaked the information after the briefing. Jacoby later denied that North was the source of his story and attributed it to a deceased staff member for Representative Dan Daniel.\\n\\nCriticism of U.S. failure to protect Seal\\nLouisiana Attorney General William Guste wrote to United States Attorney General Edwin Meese criticizing the government\\'s failure to protect Seal as a witness. At Guste\\'s request, Meese launched an investigation to determine whether or not attorneys in Louisiana, Miami, and Washington had mishandled the case, and to determine whether or not Seal should have been forced into protective custody. Government attorneys stated that Seal placed himself in danger by refusing to move his family and enter a witness protection program.\\n\\nMedia depictions\\nFilms\\nSeal is portrayed by Dennis Hopper in Doublecrossed (1991), a docudrama made for HBO.\\nSeal is portrayed by Michael Paré in the American crime drama film The Infiltrator (2016), in two brief, historically inaccurate scenes that exercise dramatic license to depict the film\\'s title character, Robert Mazur, as a passenger in a car being driven by Seal who is killed in a motorcycle drive-by shooting.\\nSeal is portrayed by Tom Cruise in the crime drama-comedy film American Made (2017), loosely based on Seal\\'s life, produced by Imagine Entertainment. Little of the film is historically accurate; most of the plot, such as the assassination of Seal\\'s brother-in-law, was invented for purposes of the film.\\n\\nTelevision\\nSeal is portrayed by theater director Thaddeus Phillips in the 2013 TV series Alias El Mexicano.\\nSeal is portrayed by Dylan Bruno in Season 1, Episode 4, of the Netflix series Narcos (2015).\\n\\nSee also\\nAllegations of CIA drug trafficking\\nKerry Committee report\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nArticles\\n\\nSwain, Mark. \"Who Killed Barry Seal?

              " 'Born on the Fourth of July (film)': 'Born on the Fourth of July is a 1989 American biographical war drama film based on the eponymous 1976 autobiography by Ron Kovic. Directed by Oliver Stone, and written by Stone and Kovic, it stars Tom Cruise, Kyra Sedgwick, Raymond J. Barry, Jerry Levine, Frank Whaley, and Willem Dafoe. The film depicts the life of Kovic (Cruise) over a 20-year period, detailing his childhood, his military service and paralysis during the Vietnam War, and his transition to anti-war activism. It is the second installment in Stone\\'s trilogy of films about the Vietnam War, following Platoon (1986) and preceding Heaven & Earth (1993).\\nProducer Martin Bregman acquired the film rights to the book in 1976 and hired Stone, also a Vietnam veteran, to co-write the screenplay with Kovic, who would be played by Al Pacino. When Stone optioned the book in 1978, the film adaptation became mired in development hell after Pacino and Bregman left, which resulted in him and Kovic putting the film on hold. After the release of Platoon, the project was revived at Universal Pictures, with Stone attached to direct. Shot on locations in the Philippines, Texas and Inglewood, California, principal photography took place from October 1988 to December, lasting 65 days of filming. The film went over its initial $14 million production budget, and ended up costing $17.8 million after reshoots.\\nUpon release, Born on the Fourth of July was praised by critics for its story, Cruise\\'s performance and Stone\\'s direction. The film was successful at the box office as it grossed over $161 million worldwide, becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of 1989. At the 62nd Academy Awards, it received eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Cruise, his first nomination, and the film won for Best Director, Stone\\'s second in that category, and Best Film Editing. The film also won four Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, Best Director and Best Screenplay.\\n\\nPlot\\nThe film opens in 1956 Massapequa, New York, with a 10-year-old Ron Kovic playing with his friends in a forest. On his Fourth of July birthday, he attends an Independence Day parade with his family and best friend Donna. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy\\'s televised inaugural address inspires a teenage Ron to join the United States Marine Corps. After attending an impassioned lecture by two Marine recruiters visiting his high school, he enlists. His decision receives support from his mother, but upsets his father, a World War II veteran. Ron goes to his prom, and dances with Donna before leaving for basic training.\\nIn October 1967, Ron is now a Marine sergeant on a reconnaissance mission in Vietnam, during his second tour of duty. He and his unit kill a number of Vietnamese villagers after mistaking them for enemy combatants. After encountering enemy fire, they flee the village and abandon its sole survivor, a crying baby. During the retreat, Ron accidentally kills Wilson, a young private in his platoon. He reports the action to his superior, who ignores the claim and advises him not to say anything else. In January 1968, Ron is critically wounded during a firefight, but is rescued by a fellow Marine. Paralyzed from the mid-chest down, he spends several months in recovery at the Bronx Veterans Hospital in New York. The hospital\\'s conditions are poor; the doctors and nurses ignore patients, abuse drugs, and operate using old equipment. Against his doctors\\' requests, Ron desperately tries to walk again with the use of braces and crutches, only to damage his legs and confine himself permanently to a wheelchair.\\nIn 1969, Ron returns home and turns to alcohol after feeling increasingly neglected and disillusioned. During an Independence Day parade, Ron is asked to give a speech, but is unable to finish after he hears a crying baby in the crowd and has a flashback to Vietnam. Ron visits Donna in Syracuse, New York, where the two reminisce. While attending a vigil for the victims of the Kent State shootings, they are separated when Donna and other protestors are taken away by police for demonstrating against the Vietnam War.\\nIn Massapequa, a drunken Ron has a heated argument with his mother, and his father decides to send him to Villa Dulce (The Sweet Villa), a Mexican haven for wounded Vietnam veterans. He has his first sexual encounter with a prostitute, whom he falls for until he sees her with another customer. Ron befriends Charlie, another paraplegic, and the two decide to travel to another village after getting kicked out of a bar. After annoying their taxicab driver, they are stranded on the side of the road and argue with each other. They are picked up by a truck driver who takes them back to Villa Dulce.\\nRon travels to Armstrong, Texas, where he discovers Wilson\\'s tombstone. He then visits the fallen soldier\\'s family in Georgia to confess his guilt. Wilson\\'s widow Jamie expresses that she is unable to forgive Ron, while his parents are more sympathetic. In 1972, Ron joins the organization Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and travels to the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida. As Richard Nixon is giving an acceptance speech for his presidential nomination, Ron expresses to a news reporter his hatred for the war and the government for abandoning the American people. His comments enrage Nixon supporters, and his interview is cut short when police attempt to remove and arrest him and other protestors. Ron and the veterans manage to break free from the officers, regroup, and charge the hall again, though not successfully. In 1976, Ron delivers a public address at the Democratic National Convention in New York City, following the publication of his autobiography.\\n\\nCast\\nIn addition, decorated Marine and Vietnam War veteran Dale Dye appears as an infantry colonel (being interviewed by a TV reporter played by Oliver Stone), Chicago Seven anti-war protester Abbie Hoffman appears as a student strike organizer at Syracuse University, and singer Edie Brickell appears as a folksinger in Syracuse. Hoffman died before the film was released, with an “In Memoriam” in his honor shown in the closing credits.\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nAl Pacino expressed interest in portraying Ron Kovic after watching the Vietnam veteran\\'s televised appearance at the 1976 Democratic National Convention and reading his autobiography. He also turned down starring roles in the Vietnam War-themed films Coming Home (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979), the former for which Kovic would act as a consultant. Kovic met with Pacino in New York, where they discussed adapting the book to film. In September 1976, Pacino\\'s manager, producer Martin Bregman, contacted Kovic\\'s agent and entered into negotiations for the film rights. The following October, Bregman\\'s production company Artists Entertainment Complex acquired the rights for $150,000. Filming was scheduled to begin in June 1977 with Paramount Pictures acting as distributor, but the project fell apart. Bregman and Pacino were unhappy with the script, and the studio dropped the film.In 1977, Bregman hired Oliver Stone, also a Vietnam veteran, to help write the screenplay. At the time, Stone had been developing Platoon (1986), and an unproduced sequel script titled Second Life, that was inspired by his own life after the war. He and Kovic bonded over their experiences during the war, and they began work on a new script in 1978 after Stone optioned the book. Stone also discussed the adaptation with William Friedkin, who turned down an opportunity to direct in favor of helming The Brink\\'s Job (1978). After Bregman secured financing from German investors, the film briefly continued development at United Artists before moving to Orion Pictures. Daniel Petrie was hired to direct, but several weeks before rehearsals, the investors withdrew from funding the film. After the project moved to Universal Pictures, Bregman and Pacino left the film. Bregman deemed the project impossible, and felt it would be overshadowed by the success of Coming Home. Stone and Kovic grew frustrated with the troubled pre-production and dropped the project, though Stone expressed his hope to return and make the film at a later time. Stone promised Kovic that if his career took off, he would return to Kovic to revive the project. Kovic stated that after the release of Platoon, Stone called Kovic and told him he was ready to return working on the film.In April 1987, John Daly, chairman and CEO of the English-based Hemdale Film Corporation, announced that it was producing the film, which would act as a sequel to Platoon. The studio entered into negotiations to finance the film in May 1988 with a $20 million budget, but it later withdrew from funding the film. Stone was announced as director in June 1988, and his Ixtlan Productions banner was enlisted as a production company. Tom Pollock, president of Universal Pictures, read the script as Stone was developing Wall Street (1987), and the studio allocated a $14 million budget on the condition that a major star appears in the lead role. Stone and Kovic then revised the script, adding the latter\\'s appearance at the 1976 Democratic National Convention.\\n\\nCasting\\nSean Penn, Charlie Sheen and Nicolas Cage were among those considered by Stone to portray Kovic. In 1987, Stone\\'s agent Paula Wagner had shown Platoon to Tom Cruise, after he had expressed interest in working with the director. Cruise met with Stone to discuss the role in January 1988. The studio was concerned over the prospects of Cruise appearing as a dramatic film lead. Stone, in particular, had dismissed his previous film Top Gun (1986) as a \"fascist movie\", but expressed that he was drawn to the actor\\'s \"Golden Boy\" image. \"I saw this kid who has everything,\" he stated. \"And I wondered what would happen if tragedy strikes, if fortune denies him ... I thought it was an interesting proposition: What would happen to Tom Cruise if something goes wrong?\" Kovic was also wary of Cruise\\'s casting, but relented when the actor visited him at his home in Massapequa, New York.Cruise spent one year preparing for the role. He visited several veterans\\' hospitals, read various books on the Vietnam War and practiced riding in a wheelchair. At one point during pre-production, Stone suggested that Cruise be injected with a chemical drug that would render him paralyzed for two days; the director believed that the drug would help him realistically portray the difficulties of being a paraplegic. The insurance company responsible for the film vetoed the idea, believing that the drug would cause permanent incapacitation. Kovic visited the production daily and would often participate in rehearsals with Cruise. Kovic also appears in the film as a World War II veteran at an Independence Day parade who flinches in response to exploding firecrackers, a reflex that Cruise\\'s character adopts later in the film. On July 3, 1989, following the end of reshoots, Kovic gave Cruise his Bronze Star Medal as a birthday present and in praise of his commitment to the role.Casting directors Risa Bramon Garcia and Billy Hopkins sought more than 200 actors for various speaking roles. They auditioned 2,000 child actors in Massapequa and hired 8,000 extras for scenes shot in Dallas, Texas. For the Fourth of July parade sequences, student protests and presidential conventions, the production employed nearly 12,000 people from the National Paralysis Foundation, Campfire Girls and American Legion to appear as extras. The film reunited Stone with several past collaborators who make brief appearances in the film. Tom Berenger, who worked with the director on Platoon, plays Gunnery Sergeant Hayes, a Marine recruiter. Michael Wincott, who had a supporting role in Talk Radio (1988), plays a wounded veteran in Mexico. John C. McGinley, in his fourth collaboration with Stone, plays an official at the 1976 Democratic Convention. Stone himself appears as a skeptical news reporter.To prepare the actors portraying Marines, military advisor Dale Dye organized one-week training missions, one in the United States, and the other in the Philippines where the battle sequences were to be filmed. Abbie Hoffman, a Yippie activist, acted as a consultant who educated the cast about the peace movement. He also makes an appearance as a protestor in Syracuse, New York. The film is dedicated to Hoffman, who died on April 12, 1989.\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography was scheduled to begin in September 1988, but did not commence until mid-October of that year. Studio executive Pollock planned an initial budget of $14 million, but the film went over budget. The high production costs prompted Stone and Cruise to waive their salaries and instead receive a percentage of the box office gross. The final production cost of the film was $17.8 million. The film was cinematographer Robert Richardson\\'s fifth collaboration with Stone, and their first to be shot in the anamorphic format. Richardson shot the film using Panavision cameras and lenses, and primarily utilized 35 mm film stocks; 16 mm and Super 16 mm stocks were also used to film the scene of Kovic demonstrating at the 1972 Republican National Convention, blended with archive footage of the actual event.Filming began in Dallas, Texas, for scenes set in the United States. The Elmwood neighborhood of Oak Cliff doubled for Massapequa, New York. The Dallas Convention Center was used to re-create the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida. The filmmakers also shot scenes at the Parkland Memorial Hospital, which stood in for the Bronx Veterans Hospital in New York. They also filmed on soundstages at Los Colinas Studios in Irving, Texas. The Philippines stood in for scenes set in Vietnam and Mexico. Stone originally wanted to shoot on location in Vietnam but was unable to do so, due to unresolved conflicts between that country and the United States. Principal photography wrapped in December 1988, after 65 days of filming.After viewing a rough cut of the film, Universal demanded that the ending, which depicted Kovic\\'s appearance at the 1976 Democratic National Convention, be reshot. The original scene was shot in Dallas, with 600 extras, but the studio was dissatisfied with the filmed footage, and requested that Stone make it \"bigger and better\". The scene was reshot in July 1989 at The Forum arena in Inglewood, California. Filming lasted one day, with 6,000 extras. The reshoot ended up costing $500,000.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe score was produced, composed and conducted by John Williams, who agreed to work on the film after viewing a rough cut version. Recording sessions took place at 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles, California. Timothy Morrison, a member of the Boston Pops Orchestra, acted as a trumpeter. Williams stated, \"I knew immediately I would want a string orchestra to sing in opposition to all the realism on the screen, and then the idea came to have a solo trumpet — not a military trumpet, but an American trumpet, to recall the happy youth of [Kovic].\" The motion picture soundtrack album was released on December 19, 1989, by MCA Records. In addition to Williams\\'s score, it features eight songs that appear in the film. AllMusic\\'s Tavia Hobbart wrote that the score \"literally haunts you as you watch the movie. It\\'s just as effective here.\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times stated, \"Mr. Williams\\'s themes are melodically strong enough so that one could imagine them being developed into a full-blown symphonic poem.\"\\n\\nRelease\\nUniversal gave the film a platform release which involved showing it in select cities before expanding distribution in the following weeks. To qualify the film for awards consideration, the studio issued a limited theatrical run in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Toronto on December 20, 1989. The film was released across North America on January 5, 1990, playing at 1,310 theaters, and expanding to 1,434 theaters by its eleventh week. A heavily edited version of the film was scheduled for broadcast on CBS in early 1991, but was shelved by the network\\'s executives due to the impending Persian Gulf War.

The website\\'s consensus reads, \"Led by an unforgettable performance from Tom Cruise, Born on the Fourth of July finds director Oliver Stone tackling thought-provoking subject matter with ambitious élan.\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 based on 16 reviews from critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.David Denby of New York magazine, stated that the film was \"a relentless but often powerful and heartbreaking piece of work, dominated by Tom Cruise\\'s impassioned performance.\" Richard Corliss of Time, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also commended Cruise\\'s performance. Vincent Canby of The New York Times said the film was \"the most ambitious nondocumentary film yet made about the entire Vietnam experience.\" Janet Maslin, also writing for The New York Times, praised Stone\\'s direction, writing that he \"reaches out instantly to his audience\\'s gut-level emotions and sustains a walloping impact for two and a half hours.\" Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that the film\\'s greatest accomplishment was \"its contrasting of the glorious illusion of war as seen from thousands of miles away to the barbarity of it up-close.\"The Washington Post published two negative reviews; Hal Hinson called the film \"alienating\", while Desson Howe was critical of Cruise\\'s \"whiny\" performance. Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times felt that the actor\\'s portrayal of Kovic was lacking in character development. Jonathan Rosenbaum derided the storytelling for \"brimming with false uplift\", and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called the film \"2 1/2 hours of self-righteousness masquerading as art.\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote, \"It\\'s almost inconceivable that Ron Kovic was as innocent as the movie and the 1976 autobiography on which it\\'s based make him out to be ... Kovic\\'s book is simple and explicit; he states his case in plain, angry words. Stone\\'s movie yells at you for two hours and twenty-five minutes.\"The film also received criticism for its dramatization of actual events, prompted by Kovic\\'s declared decision to run for Congress as a Democratic opponent to Californian Republican Robert Dornan in the 38th congressional district. As a result, Born on the Fourth of July became Stone\\'s first film to be publicly attacked in the media. Dornan criticized the film for portraying Kovic as \"[being] in a panic and mistakenly shooting his corporal to death in Vietnam, visiting prostitutes, abusing drugs and alcohol and cruelly insulting his parents\". Kovic dismissed his comments as being part of a \"hatred campaign\", and ultimately did not run for election.In an article for the New York Post, former White House Communications Director Pat Buchanan criticized the adaptation for deviating from the book, and concluded by calling Stone a \"propagandist\". Democratic State Senator Nancy Larraine Hoffmann, who took part in Syracuse University\\'s 1970 peaceful protest of the Cambodian Campaign, was critical of the film\\'s depiction of Syracuse police as \"faceless people brutalizing peaceful protesters\". Following the film\\'s wide release in January 1990, Stone wrote a letter apologizing to the city of Syracuse and its police officials.\\n\\nAccolades\\nThe film received various awards and nominations, with particular recognition for the screenplay, Cruise\\'s performance, Stone\\'s direction and the score by John Williams. The National Board of Review named it one of the \"Top 10 Films of 1989\", ranking it at number one. The film received five Golden Globe Award nominations and won four for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director and Best Screenplay, while Williams was nominated for Best Original Score.In February 1990, the film competed for the Golden Bear at the 40th Berlin International Film Festival, but lost to the American film Music Box (1990) and Czech film Larks on a String (1969). That same month, the film garnered eight Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor; its closest rival was Driving Miss Daisy, which received nine nominations. At the 62nd Oscars, Stone won a second Academy Award for Best Director; he had previously won the award for Platoon. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing; Driving Miss Daisy, The Bear, Glory and The Fabulous Baker Boys had also been nominated in that category. At the 44th British Academy Film Awards in 1991, the film received two nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Adapted Screenplay, but did not win in either category.\\n\\nSee also\\nPlatoon, the first installment in Oliver Stone\\'s Vietnam War trilogy\\nHeaven & Earth, the third installment in Stone\\'s Vietnam War trilogy\\nCasualties of War, another 1989 film set during the Vietnam War, based on the 1966 incident on Hill 192\\nVietnam War in film\\nUnited States–Vietnam relations\\n\\nReferences\\nBooks\\nExternal links\\nBorn on the Fourth of July at TomCruise.com\\nBorn on the Fourth of July at IMDb\\nBorn on the Fourth of July at the TCM Movie Database\\nBorn on the Fourth of July at Box Office Mojo\\nBorn on the Fourth of July at AllMovie\\nBorn on the Fourth of July at Rotten Tomatoes\\nBorn on the Fourth of July at Metacritic',\n",
              " 'Box Office Mojo': 'Box Office Mojo is an American website that tracks box office revenue in a systematic, algorithmic way. The site was founded in 1998 by Brandon Gray, and was bought in 2008 by IMDb, which itself is owned by Amazon.\\n\\nHistory\\nBrandon Gray began the site on August 7, 1998 making forecasts of the top 10 highest-grossing films in the United States for the following weekend.  To compare his forecasts to the actual results, he started posting the weekend grosses and wrote a regular column with box office analysis and in 1999, he started to post the Friday daily box office grosses, sourced from Exhibitor Relations, so that they were publicly available online on Saturdays and posted the Sunday weekend estimates on Sundays. As well as the weekend grosses, he was publishing the daily grosses, release schedules as well as other charts, such as all-time charts, international box office charts, genre charts, actor and director charts. The site gradually expanded to include weekend charts going back to 1982 and grosses for older films and the international section expanded to cover the weekly box office of 50 countries, international release schedules as well as box office results from up to 107 countries. \\nIn 2002, Gray partnered with Sean Saulsbury and grew the site to nearly two million readers. In 2003, a subscription model was introduced (Premier Pass) to limit certain data and features to subscribers. From 2002 to 2011, Box Office Mojo had forums. The forums had more than 16,500 registered users. On November 2, 2011, the forums were officially closed along with any user accounts, and users were invited to join IMDb\\'s message boards. The IMDb forums were subsequently closed on February 20, 2017.\\n\\nAcquisition by IMDb\\nIn July 2008, the company was purchased by Amazon.com through its subsidiary, IMDb and the Premier Pass features and content later became free. On October 10, 2014, all traffic to Box Office Mojo was redirected to IMDb\\'s box office page, before returning the following day.On October 23, 2019, Box Office Mojo unveiled a dramatic redesign resembling IMDb, and was rebranded as \"Box Office Mojo by IMDbPro\". The redesign was heavily criticized for being difficult to navigate and moving much of its content behind a paywall. Several features previously provided for free, such as box office data for franchises, genres, actors, filmmakers, distributors, budgets, and inflation-adjusted figures were moved to IMDbPro, the subscription service of IMDb. However, on March 31, 2020, certain features that were locked behind the paywall were freed. These include the brand, franchise and genre lists which were put under an \"Indices\" section.\\n\\nSee also\\nLumiere\\nThe Numbers\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nSaulsbury, Sean (October 24, 2019). \"Box Office Mojo Redesign by IMDb Pro\".

In addition to its annual awards ceremonies, BAFTA has an international programme of learning events and initiatives offering access to talent through workshops, masterclasses, scholarships, lectures and mentoring schemes in the United Kingdom and the United States.\\n\\nOrigins\\nBAFTA started out as the British Film Academy, founded in 1947 by a group of directors: David Lean, Alexander Korda, Roger Manvell, Laurence Olivier, Emeric Pressburger, Michael Powell, Michael Balcon, Carol Reed, and other major figures of the British film industry.David Lean was the founding chairman of the academy. The first Film Awards ceremony took place in May 1949, honouring the films The Best Years of Our Lives, Odd Man Out and The World Is Rich.\\nThe Guild of Television Producers and Directors was set up in 1953 with the first awards ceremony in October 1954, and in 1958 merged with the British Film Academy to form the Society of Film and Television Arts, whose inaugural meeting was held at Buckingham Palace and presided over by the Duke of Edinburgh.In 1976, Queen Elizabeth, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Princess Royal and The Earl Mountbatten of Burma officially opened the organisation\\'s headquarters at 195 Piccadilly, London, and in March the society became the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.\\n\\nRecent events\\nOn 2 February 2018, Bafta formally terminated Harvey Weinstein\\'s membership. On 26 October 2017, after the 2008 Bafta Awards, Norwegian actress Natassia Malthe had accused Weinstein of raping her in a London hotel.\\n\\nCharitable mission\\nIt is a membership organisation comprising approximately 8,000 individuals worldwide who are creatives and professionals working in and making a contribution to the film, television and games industries in the UK. In 2005, it placed an overall cap on worldwide voting membership which stood at approximately 6,500 as of 2017.BAFTA does not receive any funding from the government: it relies on income from membership subscriptions, individual donations, trusts, foundations and corporate partnerships to support its ongoing outreach work.BAFTA has offices in Scotland and Wales in the UK, in Los Angeles and New York in the United States and runs events in Hong Kong and mainland China.Amanda Berry OBE has been chief executive of the organisation since December 2000.\\n\\nLearning events and initiatives\\nIn addition to its high-profile awards ceremonies, BAFTA manages a year-round programme of educational events and initiatives including film screenings and Q&As, tribute evenings, interviews, lectures, and debates with major industry figures. With over 250 events a year, BAFTA\\'s stated aim is to inspire and inform the next generation of talent by providing a platform for some of the world\\'s most talented practitioners to pass on their knowledge and experience.Many of these events are free to watch online at BAFTA Guru and via its official channel on YouTube.\\n\\nScholarships\\nBAFTA runs a number of scholarship programmes across the UK, US and Asia.\\nLaunched in 2012, the UK programme enables talented British citizens who are in need of financial support to take an industry-recognised course in film, television or games in the UK. Each BAFTA Scholar receives up to £12,000 towards their annual course fees, and mentoring support from a BAFTA member and free access to BAFTA events around the UK. Since 2013, three students every year have received one of the Prince William Scholarships in Film, Television and Games, supported by BAFTA and Warner Bros. These scholarships are awarded in the name of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge in his role as president of BAFTA.\\nIn the US, BAFTA Los Angeles offers financial support and mentorship to British graduate students studying in the US, as well as scholarships to provide financial aid to local LA students from the inner city. BAFTA New York\\'s Media Studies Scholarship Program, set up in 2012, supports students pursuing media studies at undergraduate and graduate level institutions within the New York City area and includes financial aid and mentoring opportunities.\\nSince 2015, BAFTA has been offering scholarships for British citizens to study in China, vice versa.\\n\\nAwards\\nBAFTA presents awards for film, television and games, including children\\'s entertainment, at a number of annual ceremonies across the UK and in Los Angeles, USA.\\n\\nBAFTA awards\\nThe BAFTA award trophy is a mask, designed by American sculptor Mitzi Cunliffe. When the Guild merged with the British Film Academy to become the Society of Film and Television Arts, later the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the first \\'BAFTA award\\' was presented to Sir Charles Chaplin on his Academy Fellowship that year.\\nA BAFTA award – including the bronze mask and marble base – weighs 3.7 kg (8.2 lb) and measures 27 cm (11 in) high x 14 cm (5.5 in) wide x 8 cm (3.1 in) deep; the mask itself measures 16 cm (6.3 in) high x 14 cm (5.5 in) wide. They are made of phosphor bronze and cast in a Middlesex foundry.In 2017, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts introduced new entry rules for British films starting from the 2018/19 season to foster diversity.\\n\\nAwards ceremonies\\nFilm Awards\\nBAFTA\\'s annual film awards ceremony is known as the British Academy Film Awards, or \"the BAFTAs\", and reward the best work of any nationality seen on British cinema screens during the preceding year. In 1949 the British Film Academy, as it was then known, presented the first awards for films made in 1947 and 1948. Since 2008 the ceremony has been held at the Royal Opera House in London\\'s Covent Garden. It had been held in the Odeon cinema on Leicester Square since 2000. \\nSince 2017, the BAFTA ceremony has been held at the Royal Albert Hall. The ceremony had been performed during April or May of each year, but since 2002 it has been held in February to precede the academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\\' (AMPAS) Academy Awards, or Oscars.\\nIn order for a film to be considered for a BAFTA nomination its first public exhibition must be displayed in a cinema and it must have a UK theatrical release for no fewer than seven days of the calendar year that corresponds to the upcoming awards. A movie must be of feature length and movies from all countries are eligible in all categories, with the exception of the Alexander Korda Award for Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut which are for British films or individuals only.\\n\\nTelevision Awards and Television Craft Awards\\nThe British Academy Television Awards ceremony usually takes place during April or May, with its sister ceremony, the British Academy Television Craft Awards, usually occurring within a few weeks of it.\\nThe Television Awards, celebrating the best TV programmes and performances of the past year, are also often referred to simply as \"the BAFTAs\" or, to differentiate them from the movie awards, the \"BAFTA Television Awards\". They have been awarded annually since 1954. The first ever ceremony consisted of six categories. Until 1958, they were awarded by the Guild of Television Producers and Directors.\\nFrom 1968 until 1997, BAFTA\\'s Film and Television Awards were presented together, but from 1998 onwards they were presented at two separate ceremonies.\\nThe Television Craft Awards celebrate the talent behind the programmes, such as individuals working in visual effects, production, and costume design.\\nOnly British programmes are eligible – with the potential exception of the publicly voted Audience Award – but any cable, satellite, terrestrial or digital television stations broadcasting in the UK are eligible to submit entries, as are independent production companies who have produced programming for the channels. Individual performances can either be entered by the performers themselves or by the broadcasters. The programmes being entered must have been broadcast on or between 1 January and 31 December of the year preceding the awards ceremony.\\nSince 2014 the \"BAFTA Television Awards\" have been open to TV programmes which are only broadcast online.\\n\\nGames Awards\\nThe British Academy Games Awards ceremony traditionally takes place in March, shortly after the Film Awards ceremony in February.\\nBAFTA first recognised video games and other interactive media at its inaugural BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards ceremony during 1998, the first major change of its rules since the admittance of television thirty years earlier. Among the first winning games were GoldenEye 007, Gran Turismo and interactive comedy MindGym, sharing the spotlight with the BBC News Online website which won the news category four years consecutively. These awards allowed the academy to recognise new forms of entertainment that were engaging new audiences and challenging traditional expressions of creativity.\\nDuring 2003, the sheer ubiquity of interactive forms of entertainment and the breadth of genres and types of video games outgrew the combined ceremony, and the event was divided into the BAFTA Video Games Awards and the BAFTA Interactive Awards Despite making headlines with high-profile winners like Halo 2 and Half-Life 2 the interactive division was discontinued and disappeared from BAFTA\\'s publicity material after only two ceremonies.\\nDuring 2006, BAFTA announced its decision \"to give video games equal status with film and television\", and the academy now advertises video games as its third major topic in recognition of its importance as an art form of moving images. The same year the ceremony was performed at The Roundhouse by Chalk Farm Road in North London on 5 October and was televised for the first time on 17 October and was broadcast on the digital channel E4.\\nSince 2009, the ceremonies have been performed at the London Hilton Park Lane and Tobacco Dock, London, and have been hosted by Dara Ó Briain and Rufus Hound.\\n\\nChildren\\'s Awards\\nThe British Academy Children\\'s Awards are presented annually during November to reward excellence in the art forms of the moving image intended for children. They have been awarded annually since 1969.\\nThe academy has a long history of recognising and rewarding children\\'s programming, presenting two awards at the 1969 ceremony – The Flame of Knowledge Award for Schools Programmes and the Harlequin Award for Children\\'s Programmes.\\nAs of 2010 the Awards ceremony includes 19 categories across movies, television, video games and online content.\\nSince 2007 the Children\\'s Awards have included a Kids Vote award, voted by children between seven and 14. BAFTA Kids Vote is the annual competition for children aged between seven and 12 which is now part of BAFTA\\'s year-round BAFTA Kids programme of activity helping children \"discover, explore and find out more about the worlds of films, television and games by providing content, information and experiences\". The CBBC Me and My Movie award, a children\\'s filmmaking initiative to inspire and enable children to make their own movies and tell their own stories, has been discontinued.\\n\\nBAFTA Student Film Awards\\nBAFTA also hosts the annual BAFTA Student Film Awards as showcase for rising industry talent. The animation award was sponsored in 2017 and 2018 by animation studio Laika.\\n\\nPresidents and Vice-Presidents\\nPresidents\\n\\nThe Duke of Edinburgh (1959–1965)\\nThe Earl Mountbatten of Burma (1966–1972)\\nThe Princess Royal (1973–2001)\\nThe Lord Attenborough (2001–2010)\\nThe Duke of Cambridge (2010–present)Vice-Presidents\\n\\nThe Lord Attenborough (1973–1995)\\nThe Lord Puttnam (1995–2004)\\nMichael Grade (2004–2010)\\nDuncan Kenworthy (film) (2009–2015)\\nSophie Turner Laing (television) (2010–2015)\\nGreg Dyke (television) (2016–present)\\n\\nRoyal connections\\nPrince William, the Duke of Cambridge, has been president of the academy since February 2010.The Duke\\'s appointment follows a long tradition of royal involvement with the academy. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was the first president of the Society of Film and Television Arts (SFTA) in 1959 to 1965, followed by Earl Mountbatten of Burma and the Princess Royal, who was its president from 1972 to 2001. It was the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh\\'s generous donation of their share of profits from the film Royal Family that enabled the academy to move to its headquarters at 195 Piccadilly. The Duke of Cambridge succeeded Lord (Richard) Attenborough to become the academy\\'s fifth president in its history.\\n\\nBAFTA Los Angeles\\nBAFTA Los Angeles, founded in 1987 and currently chaired by Kathryn Busby, serves as the bridge between the Hollywood and British production and entertainment business communities.

The Los Angeles location also hosts the Student Film Awards and has an active Scholarship Program offering financial support and mentorship to UK students studying in the US. It created The Inner City Cinema, a screening program providing free screenings of theatrical films to inner city areas not served by theatres. The success of Inner City Cinema has led to further free screening programs extended to multiple inner city parks through the academy\\'s work with both the County of Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks After Dark) and The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks (Teen Summer Camps).\\n\\nBritannia Awards\\nThe Britannia Awards are BAFTA Los Angeles\\' highest accolade, a \"celebration of achievements honouring individuals and companies that have dedicated their careers to advancing the entertainment arts\".

              " 'British Board of Film Classification': 'The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC, previously the British Board of Film Censors) is a non-governmental organisation founded by the film industry in 1912 and responsible for the national classification and censorship of films exhibited at cinemas and video works (such as television programmes, trailers, adverts, public information/campaigning films, menus, bonus content etc.) released on physical media within the United Kingdom. It has a statutory requirement to classify all video works released on VHS, DVD, Blu-ray (including 3D and 4K UHD formats), and, to a lesser extent, some video games under the Video Recordings Act 1984. The BBFC was also the designated regulator for the UK age-verification scheme which was abandoned before being implemented.\\n\\nHistory and overview\\nThe BBFC was established in 1912 as the British Board of Film Censors by members of the film industry, who would rather manage their own censorship than have national or local government do it for them. The immediate impetus for the board\\'s formation stemmed from the furore surrounding the release in the UK in October 1912 of the film From the Manger to the Cross, about the life of Jesus. The film, shown at the Queen\\'s Hall, London, gained considerable publicity from a great outcry in the Daily Mail, which demanded: \"Is nothing sacred to the film maker?\", and waxed indignant about the profits for its American film producers. Although the clergy were invited to see it and found little to be affronted by, the controversy resulted in the voluntary creation of the BBFC, which began operating on 1 January 1913.The Cinematograph Act 1909 required cinemas to have licences from local authorities. The Act was introduced for reasons of public safety after nitrate film fires in unsuitable venues (fairgrounds and shops that had been hastily converted into cinemas) but the following year a court ruling determined that the criteria for granting or refusing a licence did not have to be restricted to issues of health and safety. Given that the law now allowed councils to grant or refuse licences to cinemas according to the content of the films they showed, the 1909 Act, therefore, enabled the introduction of censorship.\\nThe film industry, fearing the economic consequences of a largely unregulated censorship infrastructure, therefore formed the BBFC to take the process \\'in house\\' and establish its own system of self-regulation. By paying a fee of £2 for every reel of film viewed, and by appointing a panel of viewers under a censor, none of whom had any film trade interests, the growing cinema industry neatly created a censorship body which was both self-supporting and strictly impartial, and therefore was not swayed by any sectional interests inside the film trade or outside it. The board\\'s offices were originally at 133–135 Oxford Street, London; the building is located at the junction of Wardour Street, a centre of the British film industry for many years.Unlike the American Production Code Administration, which had a written list of violations in their  Motion Picture Production Code, the BBFC did not have a written code and were vague in their translation to producers on what constituted a violation. However, some clarity would come in 1916 when the then president of the BBFC, T. P. O\\'Connor, listed forty-three infractions, from the BBFC 1913-1915 annual reports, during the National Council of Public Morals: Cinema Commission of Inquiry (1916), indicating where a cut in a film may be required. These included:\\n\\nIn 1926, the BBFC annual report outlined grounds on seven broad categories that justified censorship, including issues related to religious, political, military, social, questions of sex, crime and cruelty. Some decisions from the early years are now subjected to derision. In 1928, the board\\'s examiners report famously claimed that Germaine Dulac\\'s surrealist film The Seashell and the Clergyman was \"Apparently meaningless\" but \"If there is a meaning, it is doubtless objectionable\".Informal links, to varying degrees of closeness, have been maintained between the BBFC and the Government throughout the Board\\'s existence. In the period before the Second World War, an extensive but unofficial system of political censorship was implemented by the BBFC for the Home Office. As the cinema became a socially powerful mass-medium, governments feared the effect of its use by others for propaganda and as happened in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany discouraged any expression of controversial political views in British films. This trend reached its climax during the 1930s. Following protests from the German Embassy after the release of a film depicting the execution of Edith Cavell (Dawn, 1928, dir. Herbert Wilcox), intense political pressure was brought to bear on the BBFC by the Home Office. A system of script vetting was introduced, whereby British studios were invited to submit screenplays to the BBFC before shooting started. Imported Hollywood films were not treated as strictly as British films, as the BBFC believed that audiences would recognise American cinema as representing a foreign culture and therefore would not apply any political messages therein to their own lives. So while the Warners gangster films and other 1930s Hollywood films that dealt explicitly with crime and the effects of the Great Depression were released in the UK largely uncut, these subjects were strictly off-limits for British film-makers.\\nDuring the Second World War, the BBFC\\'s political censorship function effectively passed to the Films Division of the Ministry of Information, and the BBFC never regained this to the same extent as before the war. The increasing climate of post-war liberalism ensured that from the 1950s onwards, controversies involving the BBFC centred more on depictions of sex and violence than on political expression. There were some notable exceptions: Yield to the Night (UK, 1956, dir. J. Lee Thompson), which opposed capital punishment; Room at the Top (UK, 1959, dir. Jack Clayton), which dealt with class divisions; Victim (UK, 1961, dir. Basil Dearden), which implicitly argued for the legalisation of homosexuality, all involved the BBFC in controversy.\\nIn autumn 1972, Lord Longford and Raymond Blackburn decided to pursue a matter of pornography classification for the film Language of Love at the Court of Appeal before Lord Denning, MR; they failed to obtain a writ of mandamus against the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, who had refused to intrude upon the BBFC\\'s remit.\\n\\nChange of name and scope\\nIn 1984 the organisation changed its name to \"reflect the fact that classification plays a far larger part in the board\\'s work than censorship\". At that time it was given responsibility for classifying videos for hire or purchase to view in the home as well as films shown in cinemas. Home video and cinema versions of a film usually receive the same certificate, although occasionally a film may receive a more restrictive certificate for the home video market (sometimes due to the bonus features), as it is easier for children to watch a home video than to be admitted into a cinema.\\nIn December 1986, the first computer game to be certified by the BBFC was an illustrated text adventure called Dracula, based on the Bram Stoker novel, published by CRL, the game received a 15 certificate. The first computer game to receive an 18 certificate, on 11 December 1987, was another illustrated text adventure called Jack the Ripper, also by CRL, which dealt with the infamous real life murders in Victorian London. The horror in both games came through largely in their detailed prose. Had the game publishers reprinted the games\\' text in book form, it would not have carried a certificate, as the BBFC has no oversight over print media. Both games had numerous certificate stickers all over their covers to emphasise to parents and retailers that they were not intended for children, as computer games carrying BBFC certificates were previously unheard of.\\nThe first video game to be refused classification by the BBFC was Carmageddon in 1997, however a modified version of the game was later awarded an 18 certificate. In June 2007, Manhunt 2 was refused classification in both its PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, meaning that the game was illegal to sell or supply. A modified version was made that was accepted by the ESRB but was still refused classification from the BBFC. The second decision was later overturned by the Video Appeals Committee (an independent body set up by legislation); the BBFC then asked the High Court for a judicial review of the VAC decision. The High Court ruled that the VAC had made errors in law and instructed it to reconsider its decision, the VAC subsequently ruled that the modified version of the game should receive an 18 certificate, which the BBFC accepted.On 16 June 2009, the UK\\'s Department of Culture, Media and Sport ruled in favour of the PEGI system to be the sole classification system for videogames and software in the UK. This decision would also, unlike beforehand, allow PEGI ratings to be legally enforced much like the BBFC ratings. Initially expected to take effect from 1 April 2011, the legislation was put into effect on 30 July 2012.Netflix and the BBFC announced an age classification partnership on 13 March 2019 where the former will classify their content in the United Kingdom with BBFC ratings. The partnership came at the time when digital media is on the rise worldwide and when parents are concerned about children seeing inappropriate content on video on demand or online gaming platforms. The implementation of BBFC ratings into Netflix UK content took effect at the end of October 2019.\\n\\nResponsibilities and powers\\nThe board is a self-funded quango. Its business affairs are controlled by a council of management selected from leading figures in the manufacturing and servicing sectors of the film industry. This council appoints the President, who has statutory responsibility for the classification of videos and the Director who has executive responsibility and formulates policy. The board, which is based in Soho Square, London, is financed from the fees it charges for classifying films and videos and is run on a not-for-profit basis.\\n\\nEditing\\nThe BBFC can also advise cuts for a less-restrictive rating. This generally occurs in borderline cases where distributors have requested a certificate and the BBFC has rated the work at a more-restrictive level; however, some cuts are compulsory, such as scenes that violate the Protection of Children Act 1978 or Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937. The final certificate then depends on the distributor\\'s decision on whether or not to make the suggested cuts. Some works are even rejected if the distributor refuses the cut.\\nThe examiners and the directors of the BBFC are hired on a permanent basis. Examiners are required to watch 5 hours 20 mins of media, to a maximum of 35 hours a week. Turnover is low and vacancies, when available, appear on its London job vacancies website.\\n\\nCinema\\nIn the case of films shown in cinemas, local authorities have the final legal authorisation over who can view a particular film. The majority of the time, local authorities accept the board\\'s recommendation for a certificate for a film. There have been some notable exceptions – particularly in the 1970s when the board allowed films such as Last Tango in Paris and The Exorcist to be released with an X certificate (essentially the same as today\\'s \"18\") – but many local authorities chose to ban the films regardless. Thirty-nine local authorities in the UK either imposed an outright ban, or imposed an X certificate, on Monty Python\\'s Life of Brian, which the BBFC had rated as AA (Suitable for ages 14+).Conversely, in 2002, a few local authorities regraded Spider-Man from 12 to PG, allowing children younger than 12 to see the film. However, the BBFC were already in the process of replacing the 12 rating with a new 12A, which allowed under-12s to see the film if accompanied by an adult, so shortly afterwards, the BBFC reclassified Spider-Man as 12A. The first 12A certificate awarded was for The Bourne Identity.\\n\\nVideo releases\\nThe Video Recordings Act requires that video releases not exempt (music, documentary, non-fiction, video games, etc.) under the Act had to be classified, making it illegal to supply any recording that had not been certified. Certificates could restrict release to any age of 18 or under, or to only licensed sex-shops. The government currently designate the BBFC as the authority for certifying video releases. As the law requires the certificate to be displayed on the packaging and media labels of the video recording, in practice only UK releases can be legally sold or hired in the UK, even if a foreign release had identical content.Local authorities do not have such power for video recordings. Under the Video Recording Act 1984, all non-exempt recordings must be classified by an authority chosen by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. This classification is legally binding, in that supply of material contrary to its certificate (recordings that have been refused a certificate, or supplying to someone younger than the certified age) is a criminal offence. However, possession is not an offence in itself, other than in the case of \"possession with intent to supply\". Since the introduction of the Act, the BBFC has been the chosen authority. In theory this authority could be revoked, but in practice such a revocation has never been suggested, since most local authorities simply don\\'t have the resources needed to do such things as remove cuts, pass films that the BBFC rejected and vice versa, put in place new cuts, etc., regularly.\\n\\nVideo games\\nThe BBFC has also rated some video games. Normally these are exempt from classification, unless they depict human sexual activity, human genital organs or gross acts of violence, in which case the publishers should submit the game for classification. Publishers may opt to submit a game for classification even if they are not obliged to.\\nUnder the Digital Economy Act 2010, the responsibility for rating video games in the United Kingdom has passed from the BBFC to the Video Standards Council using the PEGI system. A game is only submitted to the BBFC if it contains strong pornographic material or if it includes video material that is not directly accessible through the game itself (e.g. a documentary).\\n\\nMobile operators\\nThe BBFC also provide a classification service for mobile phone operators. BBFC guidelines for film and video are used to calibrate the filters used by the operators to restrict access to internet content. The default assumption is that mobile phone users are under 18 years of age. The BBFC guidelines are based on public consultations conducted every 4–5 years.\\n\\nWebsites\\nUnder the Digital Economy Act 2017 the BBFC was appointed as the UK\\'s regulator for pornographic websites. As regulator, the BBFC was intended to be responsible for identifying commercial pornographic websites accessible in the UK and empowered to take action against any which did not age-verify their users, including placing restrictions on their payment transactions or ordering their blocking by Internet service providers. This was to be the case regardless of whether the websites were UK-based or foreign-based. The BBFC had been informally named as the likely regulator in 2016, and in November of that year it was invited to take on the role and agreed to do so. The formal appointment of the BBFC took place in February 2018. Before the BBFC was due to begin its role, it conducted a public consultation on its draft guidance beginning in March 2018. In 2018 the BBFC estimated that 5 million commercial pornographic websites existed on the Internet.In March 2019 the BBFC published its guidance, which stated that social media would not fall under the BBFC\\'s jurisdiction, and nor would websites where pornography made up a third or less of the website\\'s material. The BBFC proposed that a voluntary certification scheme should cover age verification providers. Margot James, the UK government\\'s digital minister, said that the government had asked HM Treasury to provide indemnity of up to £10 million to the BBFC to protect it against legal challenges, as the uncertainty surrounding the possibility of such challenges would leave the BBFC unable to get commercial insurance. There were numerous delays to the date at which the BBFC would begin its regulatory role, until in 2019 the UK government announced that the part of the Act dealing with the regulation of pornographic websites would not be implemented.\\n\\nCurrent certificates\\nThe BBFC currently issues the following certificates. The current category symbols were introduced in October 2019, replacing the previous ones that had been in place since 2002.\\n\\nMaterial that is exempt from classification sometimes uses symbols similar to BBFC certificates, for example an E \"certificate\". There is no legal obligation, nor a particular scheme, for labelling material that is exempt from classification. On the BBFC\\'s online classification database, material that has been refused a classification uses an \"N/A\" symbol in place of a rating symbol.\\n\\nAge-verification certificate\\nAs part of the implementation of the Digital Economy Act 2017, the BBFC and NCC Group were planning to introduce an age-verification certificate (AVC or AV Certificate), a voluntary, non-statutory certificate awarded to Internet age-verification providers who meet standards of privacy and data security. Plans to mandate online age-verification to deny those who do not prove they are aged over 18 access to pornographic website content were subsequently abandoned.\\n\\nAttitudes to censorship\\nHistorically the Board has faced strong criticism for their overzealous attitude towards censoring films. Prior to the liberalising decade of the 1960s, films were routinely and extensively censored as a means of social control. For example, Rebel Without a Cause was cut to reduce the \"possibility of teenage rebellion\". Ingmar Bergman\\'s Smiles of a Summer Night was cut to remove \"overtly sexual or provocative\" language.The BBFC\\'s attitude became more liberal during the 1960s, and it concentrated on censoring films that featured graphic sex and violence. However, some Board decisions caused controversy in the 1970s when it banned a series of films that were released uncut and were popular in other countries (such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Last House on the Left), or released other controversial films, such as Straw Dogs and A Clockwork Orange. However, under recent President Andreas Whittam Smith and current incumbent Sir Quentin Thomas, guidelines have been relaxed again, allowing the release, usually uncut, of these previously banned films on video and in cinemas. Some films from the 1970s remain unreleased, but many of these titles remain banned primarily because their distributors have not chosen to re-submit the films to the BBFC, almost certainly for commercial reasons. If they were, they would be likely to receive a more sympathetic hearing than 30 to 40 years ago. Two notable examples from this period include the 1969 film Love Camp 7, rejected in 2002, and Women in Cellblock 9, released in 1977 and rejected in 2004. Both films contain substantial scenes of sexual violence and have remained completely banned following a re-submission since 2000.\\nIn general, attitudes to what material is suitable for viewing by younger audiences have changed over the years, and this is reflected by the reclassification of older films being re-released on video. For example, a 1913 film given the former A rating could very probably be rated PG today. An extreme example of this is the rating of the horror film Revenge of the Zombies, with a U certificate upon its video release in the late 1990s, whereas, when it was first examined as a film in 1951, it was given one of the first X ratings. The Bela Lugosi horror film Island of Lost Souls was refused a certificate when first submitted in 1932, was granted an X in the 1950s, and a 12 for home video release in 1996 – when submitted for a modern video classification in 2011, it was re-classified as a PG.\\nThe BBFC are also known to cut the words \"spaz\" and \"retard\" from U certified films and videos on the grounds of discrimination (though \"spaz\" is not considered as derogatory in the United States as it is in the United Kingdom: \"spaz\" in American slang means \"someone who overreacts to a minor problem\": in British English it is a slang word for spastic (The British Spastics Society changed its name to Scope because the word was used as a general term of abuse and not in its former sense of someone with particular mental or physical disabilities.) \"Retard,\" however, has been censored on some American TV shows for being derogatory). One example of this was when Marmaduke was passed U after the word \"spaz\" was removed. The uncut version would have been rated 12. They also award higher ratings to films that contain potentially imitable and dangerous behaviour; this includes all three Jackass films being passed 18, and Fred: The Movie being passed 12. They are also very serious about suicide themes, references, or attempts, and will either cut them or award a higher rating. An example of this was in 2010, when the Board cut the Hindi film Anjaana Anjaani by two minutes and thirty-one seconds to remove references to and sight of someone attempting suicide by asphyxiation so the distributor could get a cinema 12A certificate. In its uncut form the film was released on home video with an 18 certificate. The Hunger Games was assessed before formal classification, with the film\\'s studio wishing to obtain a 12A for financial and marketing reasons.  To get this, seven seconds of footage was cut and blood splashes were digitally removed to reduce emphasis on blood and injury, as an alternative to the uncut film being rated 15.\\n\\nRelaxation\\nThere has been considerable relaxation since 1999. The relaxation of guidelines has also made hardcore pornography widely available to adult audiences through the R18 rating. Films with this rating are only legally available from licensed sex shops, of which there are about 300 in the UK. They may also be seen in specially licensed cinemas.\\nThere are also examples of films with stronger sexual content, some including real images of sexual intercourse, being approved at \\'18\\' level.  Recent examples include the passing of Irreversible, 9 Songs, Antichrist, and numerous other films uncut for cinema and video viewing. Despite this trend towards liberalisation, anti-censorship campaigners are still critical of the BBFC. It has attracted criticism from conservative press, in particular the Daily Mail, on the grounds that the release of sexually explicit and violent films was corrupting the nation. The newspaper\\'s most famous clash with the BBFC came in 1997 when the board released the David Cronenberg film Crash without cuts. The following day (19 March 1997) the Mail led with the banner headline \"Censor\\'s Yes To Depraved Sex Film\" Westminster City Council imposed its own ban on the film after the decision, although anyone wanting to watch the film in a cinema only had to walk along to the non-Westminster half of Shaftesbury Avenue, which is in the neighbouring borough of Camden.\\n\\nCurrent concerns\\nThe BBFC\\'s current guidelines identify a number of specific areas considered when awarding certificates or requiring cuts. These are: \\n\\nDepictions of cruelty and harassment based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or mental or physical disability,\\nAdult themes and situations that may be considered too distressing for younger or more sensitive viewers,\\nOffensive language (i.e., profanity and use of racial and ethnic slurs),\\nNudity\\nSexual content (including scenes of sexual activity and spoken/visual references to sex),\\nViolence\\nGore and injury detail\\nSexual violence (rape and forced disrobing especially),\\nDangerous actions that can easily be imitated by younger, more naive viewers (certain combat moves [ear-claps, headbutts, and neck-breaking in particular]),\\nAll visual and verbal references to suicide [particularly if it involves hanging oneself or slashing one\\'s wrists],\\nDetailed criminal acts [such as breaking into a house using a credit card to jimmy the lock or hotwiring a car],\\nActions that result in injury or death in real life, but are almost always shown in the media (especially on shows aimed at younger audiences, such as cartoons) with no negative consequences, such as hiding in appliances that can trap and kill small children [i.e., tumble driers and old refrigerators], ingesting or misusing common household chemicals, or creating dangerous devices from common household items [such as a flamethrower from an aerosol can and a cigarette lighter] – fall under this category),\\nScenes of horror, threat, and danger and their intensity on audience members, and,\\nDrug abuse being condoned or glamorised.The BBFC also continues to demand cuts of any material it believes breaches the provisions of the Obscene Publications Act or any other legislation (most notably the Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937 [which forbids the depiction of animals being abused or in distress] and the Protection of Children Act 1978 [which, as amended, forbids the depiction of minors engaged in sex or in sexually suggestive poses or situations]). In 2009, 2% of cinema films had material cut, and 3.6% of videos. Most cuts actually occur in videos rated for 18 or R18, rather than videos intended for viewing by under-18s. In 2009, 16.8% of 18 videos, and 27.3% of R18 videos, had material cut.There is no theme or subject matter considered inherently unsuitable for classification at any level, although more controversial topics may drive a movie to be given a more restrictive rating. This is in keeping with current practice in most liberal democracies, but in sharp contrast to the early days of the BBFC in which such adult themes as prostitution, incest, and the relations of capital and labour were unacceptable regardless of the rating.\\n\"\\'Adult\" or \"strong\" language can earn a film a more restrictive certificate, though BBFC policy states that there are no constraints on language use in films awarded an 18 certificate. It is difficult to compare the BBFC\\'s policies in this area with those in other countries as there are different taboos regarding profanity in other languages and indeed in other English-speaking countries. For example, the use of \"strong\" language has little effect on a film\\'s classification in France. The BBFC\\'s policy proved particularly controversial in the case of Ken Loach\\'s Sweet Sixteen in 2002, which was passed uncut only at 18 certificate, even though its main characters were teenagers who frequently used profanities that the director argued were typical of the social group his film depicted. The film received similar certificates in Ireland (also an 18 certificate) and the United States. Shane Meadows\\' film This Is England was also passed uncut only at 18 due to its repeated use of racist terms, and the climatic scene where Combo becomes irate and pummels his friend Milky while insulting him. On the other hand, some films feature strong language but nevertheless do not carry particularly restrictive certificates. The King\\'s Speech was passed for a 12A rating despite its repeated use of the word \"fuck\" in two scenes, which would normally raise the rating to a 15 certificate; the BBFC justified its decision, saying that the profanity was \"in a speech therapy context\".\\nThere are minimal restrictions of the depiction of non-sexual nudity, which is allowed in even U and PG certificate films (for example, The Simpsons Movie—which was given a PG-13 rating in the US – was given a PG certificate in the UK, leaving the sequence where Bart skateboards naked through town and his genitals are shown through an open space in a hedge unedited), but scenes of (simulated) sexual activity are limited to more restricted certificates. With regard to material that is intended primarily as pornographic the Board\\'s policy, as stated on its website is \"Material which appears to be simulated is generally passed \\'18\\', while images of real sex are confined to the \\'R18\\' category.\" However, for some years depictions of real sex have been allowed in 18 certificate videos intended as educational, and in recent years a number of works such as Patrice Chéreau\\'s Intimacy and Michael Winterbottom\\'s 9 Songs, which feature apparently unsimulated sex have been passed uncut for theatrical release.\\nViolence remains one of the most problematic areas for censorship in the UK, especially when it\\'s in conjunction with sex or likely to sway more impressionable viewers into thinking the violence depicted is \"glamorous\" or \"fun\" and \"risk-free.\"  However, the Board takes into account issues of context and whether it considers scenes of sexual violence to \"eroticise\" or \"endorse\" sexual assault. In 2002, the board passed Gaspar Noé\\'s Irréversible uncut, but less than a month later cut Takashi Miike\\'s Ichi the Killer by three and a quarter minutes to remove scenes of sexual violence. A Serbian Film suffered from forty-nine individual cuts by the BBFC, which totalled to four minutes and eleven seconds of cuts. The cuts were made to remove \"portrayals of children in a sexualised or abusive context and images of sexual and sexualised violence which have a tendency to eroticise or endorse the behaviour\" as the Board\\'s website states.\\nCriminal and dangerous acts that can be easily imitated, as well as scenes condoning, glamorising, or showing clear instruction of how to abuse drugs have also been the subject of UK editing. The issue of depicting dangerous acts that can easily be imitated in real life is one that does not seem to figure especially highly in the censorship systems of most other countries (though the US has done this on occasion, often as the result of public backlash, as seen on the MTV shows Beavis and Butt-head and Jackass). In the UK, numerous minor cuts have been made, primarily to films whose distributors want a PG or 12A certificate, to scenes of characters performing acts that would be considered dangerous, criminal, or harmful if done in real life. For example, in 2006, issues involving suicide by hanging became problematic; The Ren & Stimpy Show Series 1 DVD set (classified PG) was edited to remove the song \"The Lord Loves a Hangin\\'\" because the song implied that hanging is \"comedic, fun, and risk-free\". Paranoia Agent Volume 3 DVD set (classified 18) was also cut to remove the depiction of a child nearly hanging herself for the same reason.The requirement to have films classified and censored can cost film producers up to thousands of pounds. The North West New Wave, a blanket term recently used by both film makers and local press to describe independent filmmakers in the Northwest of England, is currently campaigning for the introduction of a voluntary \\'Unrated 18\\' classification in the UK.On 6 June 2011, the BBFC refused a classification for the horror film The Human Centipede II. The previous film in the series was passed uncut at 18, but due to a shift in context and focus, the BBFC judged that the sequel could fall foul of the Obscene Publications Act. The film was eventually passed 18 after cuts were made.\\n\\nLeadership\\nPresidents of the BBFC\\nGeorge A. Redford (1 January 1913 – 12 November 1916)\\nT. P.

              " 'Broadway theatre': 'Broadway theatre, also simply known as Broadway, refers to the theatrical performances which are presented in the 41 professional theatres, each with 500 or more seats, located in the Theater District and the Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.  Broadway and London\\'s West End together represent the highest commercial level of live theater in the English-speaking world.While the thoroughfare itself is eponymous with the district and its collection of 41 theaters, and it is also closely identified with Times Square, only four of the theaters are located on Broadway itself (being the Broadway Theatre, the Palace Theatre, the Minskoff Theatre, and the Winter Garden Theatre). The rest are located on the numbered cross streets extending from the Nederlander Theatre one block south of Times Square on West 41st Street, north along either side of Broadway to 53rd street, as well as the Vivian Beaumont Theater, at Lincoln Center on West 65th street. While exceptions exist, the term \"Broadway theatre\" is generally reserved for venues with a seating capacity of at least 500 people, smaller theaters are referred to as off-Broadway (regardless of location), while very small venues (less than 100) are called off-off-Broadway, a term that can also apply to non-commercial or avant garde theater, or productions held outside of traditional theater venues.The Theater District is a popular tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2018–2019 season (which ended May 26, 2019) total attendance was 14,768,254 and Broadway shows had US$1,829,312,140 in grosses, with attendance up 9.5%, grosses up 10.3%, and playing weeks up 9.3%.Most Broadway shows are musicals. Historian Martin Shefter argues that \"\\'Broadway musicals\\', culminating in the productions of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, became enormously influential forms of American popular culture\" and contributed to making New York City the cultural capital of the world.\"\\n\\nHistory\\nEarly theatre in New York\\nNew York did not have a significant theatre presence until about 1750, when actor-managers Walter Murray and Thomas Kean established a resident theatre company at the Theatre on Nassau Street, which held about 280 people. They presented Shakespeare plays and ballad operas such as The Beggar\\'s Opera. In 1752, William Hallam sent a company of twelve actors from Britain to the colonies with his brother Lewis as their manager. They established a theatre in Williamsburg, Virginia and opened with The Merchant of Venice and The Anatomist. The company moved to New York in 1753, performing ballad operas and ballad-farces like Damon and Phillida. The Revolutionary War suspended theatre in New York, but thereafter theatre resumed in 1798, the year the 2,000-seat Park Theatre was built on Chatham Street (now called Park Row). The Bowery Theatre opened in 1826, followed by others.\\nBy the 1840s, P.T. Barnum was operating an entertainment complex in Lower Manhattan. In 1829, at Broadway and Prince Street, Niblo\\'s Garden opened and soon became one of New York\\'s premiere nightspots. The 3,000-seat theatre presented all sorts of musical and non-musical entertainments. In 1844, Palmo\\'s Opera House opened and presented opera for only four seasons before bankruptcy led to its rebranding as a venue for plays under the name Burton\\'s Theatre. The Astor Opera House opened in 1847. A riot broke out in 1849 when the lower-class patrons of the Bowery objected to what they perceived as snobbery by the upper class audiences at Astor Place: \"After the Astor Place Riot of 1849, entertainment in New York City was divided along class lines: opera was chiefly for the upper middle and upper classes, minstrel shows and melodramas for the middle class, variety shows in concert saloons for men of the working class and the slumming middle class.\"The plays of William Shakespeare were frequently performed on the Broadway stage during the period, most notably by American actor Edwin Booth who was internationally known for his performance as Hamlet. Booth played the role for a famous 100 consecutive performances at the Winter Garden Theatre in 1865 (with the run ending just a few months before Booth\\'s brother John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln), and would later revive the role at his own Booth\\'s Theatre (which was managed for a time by his brother Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.). Other renowned Shakespeareans who appeared in New York in this era were Henry Irving, Tommaso Salvini, Fanny Davenport, and Charles Fechter.\\n\\nBirth of the musical and post-Civil War\\nTheatre in New York moved from downtown gradually to midtown Manhattan beginning around 1850, seeking less expensive real estate. In the beginning of the 19th century, the area that now comprises the Theater District was owned by a handful of families and comprised a few farms. In 1836, Mayor Cornelius Lawrence opened 42nd Street and invited Manhattanites to \"enjoy the pure clean air.\" Close to 60 years later, theatrical entrepreneur Oscar Hammerstein I built the iconic Victoria Theater on West 42nd Street.Broadway\\'s first \"long-run\" musical was a 50-performance hit called The Elves in 1857. In 1870, the heart of Broadway was in Union Square, and by the end of the century, many theatres were near Madison Square. Theatres did not arrive in the Times Square area until the early 1900s, and the Broadway theatres did not consolidate there until a large number of theatres were built around the square in the 1920s and 1930s. New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London, but Laura Keene\\'s \"musical burletta\" The Seven Sisters (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances. It was at a performance by Keene\\'s troupe of Our American Cousin in Washington, D.C. that Abraham Lincoln was shot.\\n\\nThe first theatre piece that conforms to the modern conception of a musical, adding dance and original music that helped to tell the story, is considered to be The Black Crook, which premiered in New York on September 12, 1866. The production was five-and-a-half hours long, but despite its length, it ran for a record-breaking 474 performances. The same year, The Black Domino/Between You, Me and the Post was the first show to call itself a \"musical comedy\".Tony Pastor opened the first vaudeville theatre one block east of Union Square in 1881, where Lillian Russell performed. Comedians Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between 1878 (The Mulligan Guard Picnic) and 1890, with book and lyrics by Harrigan and music by his father-in-law David Braham. These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York\\'s lower classes and represented a significant step forward from vaudeville and burlesque, towards a more literate form. They starred high quality singers (Lillian Russell, Vivienne Segal, and Fay Templeton), instead of the women of questionable repute who had starred in earlier musical forms.\\nAs transportation improved, poverty in New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values. As in England, during the latter half of the century, the theatre began to be cleaned up, with less prostitution hindering the attendance of the theatre by women. Gilbert and Sullivan\\'s family-friendly comic opera hits, beginning with H.M.S. Pinafore in 1878, were imported to New York (by the authors and also in numerous unlicensed productions). They were imitated in New York by American productions such as Reginald Dekoven\\'s Robin Hood (1891) and John Philip Sousa\\'s El Capitan (1896), along with operas, ballets and other British and European hits.\\n\\n1890s and early 1900s\\nCharles H. Hoyt\\'s A Trip to Chinatown (1891) became Broadway\\'s long-run champion, holding the stage for 657 performances. This would not be surpassed until Irene in 1919. In 1896, theatre owners Marc Klaw and A. L. Erlanger formed the Theatrical Syndicate, which controlled almost every legitimate theatre in the US for the next sixteen years. However, smaller vaudeville and variety houses proliferated, and Off-Broadway was well established by the end of the 19th century.\\nA Trip to Coontown (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by African Americans in a Broadway theatre (largely inspired by the routines of the minstrel shows), followed by the ragtime-tinged Clorindy: The Origin of the Cakewalk (1898), and the highly successful In Dahomey (1902). Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 1900s made up of songs written in New York\\'s Tin Pan Alley involving composers such as Gus Edwards, John Walter Bratton, and George M. Cohan (Little Johnny Jones (1904), 45 Minutes From Broadway (1906), and George Washington Jr. (1906)). Still, New York runs continued to be relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until World War I.\\nA few very successful British musicals continued to achieve great success in New York, including Florodora in 1900–01.\\n\\n1900–1925\\nIn the early years of the 20th century, translations of popular late-19th century continental operettas were joined by the \"Princess Theatre\" shows of the 1910s by writers such as P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton, and Harry B. Smith. Victor Herbert, whose work included some intimate musical plays with modern settings as well as his string of famous operettas (The Fortune Teller (1898), Babes in Toyland (1903), Mlle. Modiste (1905), The Red Mill (1906), and Naughty Marietta (1910)).Beginning with The Red Mill, Broadway shows installed electric signs outside the theatres. Since colored bulbs burned out too quickly, white lights were used, and Broadway was nicknamed \"The Great White Way\". In August 1919, the Actors\\' Equity Association demanded a standard contract for all professional productions. After a strike shut down all the theatres, the producers were forced to agree. By the 1920s, the Shubert Brothers had risen to take over the majority of the theatres from the Erlanger syndicate.During this time, the play Lightnin\\' by Winchell Smith and Frank Bacon became the first Broadway show to reach 700 performances. From then, it would go on to become the first show to reach 1,000 performances. Lightnin\\' was the longest-running Broadway show until being overtaken in performance totals by Abie\\'s Irish Rose in 1925.\\n\\nCompeting with motion pictures\\nThe motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. At first, films were silent and presented only limited competition. By the end of the 1920s, films like The Jazz Singer were presented with synchronized sound, and critics wondered if the cinema would replace live theatre altogether. While live vaudeville could not compete with these inexpensive films that featured vaudeville stars and major comedians of the day, other theatre survived. The musicals of the Roaring Twenties, borrowing from vaudeville, music hall, and other light entertainment, tended to ignore plot in favor of emphasizing star actors and actresses, big dance routines, and popular songs. Florenz Ziegfeld produced annual spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets and elaborate costumes, but there was little to tie the various numbers together. Typical of the 1920s were lighthearted productions such as Sally; Lady Be Good; Sunny; No, No, Nanette; Harlem; Oh, Kay!; and Funny Face. Their books may have been forgettable, but they produced enduring standards from George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Vincent Youmans, and Rodgers and Hart, among others, and Noël Coward, Sigmund Romberg, and Rudolf Friml continued in the vein of Victor Herbert. Live theatre has survived the invention of cinema.\\n\\nBetween the wars\\nLeaving these comparatively frivolous entertainments behind and taking the drama a step forward, Show Boat premiered on December 27, 1927, at the Ziegfeld Theatre. It represented a complete integration of book and score, with dramatic themes, as told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement, woven together more seamlessly than in previous musicals. It ran for 572 performances.\\n\\nThe 1920s also spawned a new age of American playwright with the emergence of Eugene O\\'Neill, whose plays Beyond the Horizon, Anna Christie, The Hairy Ape, Strange Interlude and Mourning Becomes Electra proved that there was an audience for serious drama on Broadway, and O\\'Neill\\'s success paved the way for major dramatists like Elmer Rice, Maxwell Anderson, Robert E. Sherwood, Clifford Odets, Tennessee Williams, and Arthur Miller, as well as writers of comedy like George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. Classical revivals also proved popular with Broadway theatre-goers, notably John Barrymore in Hamlet and Richard III, John Gielgud in Hamlet, The Importance of Being Earnest and Much Ado About Nothing, Walter Hampden and José Ferrer in Cyrano de Bergerac, Paul Robeson and Ferrer in Othello, Maurice Evans in Richard II and the plays of George Bernard Shaw, and Katharine Cornell in such plays as Romeo and Juliet, Antony and Cleopatra, and Candida.\\nAs World War II approached, a dozen Broadway dramas addressed the rise of Nazism in Europe and the issue of American non-intervention. The most successful was Lillian Hellman\\'s Watch on the Rhine, which opened in April 1941.\\n\\n1943–1970\\nAfter the lean years of the Great Depression, Broadway theatre had entered a golden age with the blockbuster hit Oklahoma!, in 1943, which ran for 2,212 performances. According to John Kenrick\\'s writings on Broadway musicals, \"Every season saw new stage musicals send songs to the top of the charts. Public demand, a booming economy and abundant creative talent kept Broadway hopping. To this day, the shows of the 1950s form the core of the musical theatre repertory.\" Kenrick notes that \"the late 1960s marked a time of cultural upheaval. The changes would prove painful for many—including those behind the scenes, as well as those in the audience.\" Of the 1970s, Kenrick writes: \"Just when it seemed that traditional book musicals were back in style, the decade ended with critics and audiences giving mixed signals.\"Ken Bloom observed that \"The 1960s and 1970s saw a worsening of the area [Times Square] and a drop in the number of legitimate shows produced on Broadway.\" By way of comparison, in the 1950 to 1951 season (May to May) 94 productions opened on Broadway; in the 1969 to 1970 season (June to May) there were 59 productions (fifteen were revivals). In the twenties, there were 70–80 theaters, but by 1969, there were 36 left.\\n\\n1980s\\nIn early 1982, Joe Papp, the theatrical producer and director who established The Public Theater, led the \"Save the Theatres\" campaign. It was a not-for-profit group supported by the Actors Equity union to save the theater buildings in the neighborhood from demolition by monied Manhattan development interests. Papp provided resources, recruited a publicist and celebrated actors, and provided audio, lighting, and technical crews for the effort.At Papp\\'s behest, in July 1982, a bill was introduced in the 97th Congress, entitled \"H.R.6885, A bill to designate the Broadway/Times Square Theatre District in the City of New York as a national historic site\". The legislation would have provided certain US government resources and assistance to help the city preserve the district. Faced with strong opposition and lobbying by Mayor Ed Koch\\'s Administration and corporate Manhattan development interests, the bill was not passed. The Save the Theatres campaign then turned their efforts to supporting establishment of the Theater District as a registered historic district. In December 1983, Save the Theatres prepared \"The Broadway Theater District, a Preservation Development and Management Plan\", and demanded that each theater in the district receive landmark designation. Mayor Ed Koch ultimately reacted by creating a Theater Advisory Council, which included Papp.\\n\\n2020–2021\\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Broadway theaters closed March 12, 2020, shuttering 16 shows that were playing or were in the process of opening. The shutdown was extended first to April, then to May, then June, then September 2020 and January 2021, and later to June 1, 2021. The 74th Tony Awards were also postponed and were supposed to be held virtually later in 2020. Tony nominations were announced on October 15, 2020 by James Monroe Iglehart.\\n\\nDescription\\nSchedule\\nAlthough there are some exceptions, shows with open-ended runs generally have evening performances Tuesday through Saturday, with a 7:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. \"curtain\". The afternoon \"matinée\" performances are at 2:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays and at 3:00 p.m. on Sundays. This makes for an eight-performance week. On this schedule, most shows do not play on Monday and the shows and theatres are said to be \"dark\" on that day. The actors and the crew in these shows tend to regard Sunday evening through Monday evening as their weekend. The Tony award presentation ceremony is usually held on a Sunday evening in June to fit this schedule.\\nIn recent years, some shows have moved their Tuesday show time an hour earlier to 7:00 pm. The rationale for this move was that since fewer tourists take in shows midweek, Tuesday attendance depends more on local patrons. The earlier curtain makes it possible for suburban patrons to get home by a reasonable hour after the show. Some shows, especially those produced by Disney, change their performance schedules fairly frequently depending on the season. This is done in order to maximize access to their target audience.\\n\\nProducers and theatre owners\\nMost Broadway producers and theatre owners are members of The Broadway League (formerly \"The League of American Theatres and Producers\"), a trade organization that promotes Broadway theatre as a whole, negotiates contracts with the various theatrical unions and agreements with the guilds, and co-administers the Tony Awards with the American Theatre Wing, a service organization. While the League and the theatrical unions are sometimes at loggerheads during those periods when new contracts are being negotiated, they also cooperate on many projects and events designed to promote professional theatre in New York.\\nOf the four non-profit theatre companies with Broadway theatres, all four (Lincoln Center Theater, Manhattan Theatre Club, Roundabout Theatre Company, and Second Stage Theatre) belong to the League of Resident Theatres and have contracts with the theatrical unions which are negotiated separately from the other Broadway theatre and producers. (Disney also negotiates apart from the League, as did Livent before it closed down its operations.)\\nThe majority of Broadway theatres are owned or managed by three organizations: the Shubert Organization, a for-profit arm of the non-profit Shubert Foundation, which owns seventeen theatres; the Nederlander Organization, which controls nine theatres; and Jujamcyn, which owns five Broadway houses.\\n\\nPersonnel\\nBoth musicals and stage plays on Broadway often rely on casting well-known performers in leading roles to draw larger audiences or bring in new audience members to the theatre. Actors from movies and television are frequently cast for the revivals of Broadway shows or are used to replace actors leaving a cast. There are still, however, performers who are primarily stage actors, spending most of their time \"on the boards\", and appearing in television and in screen roles only secondarily. As Patrick Healy of The New York Times noted:\\n\\nBroadway once had many homegrown stars who committed to working on a show for a year, as Nathan Lane has for The Addams Family. In 2010, some theater heavyweights like Mr. Lane were not even nominated; instead, several Tony Awards were given for productions that were always intended to be short-timers on Broadway, given that many of their film-star performers had to move on to other commitments.\\nAccording to Mark Shenton, \"One of the biggest changes to the commercial theatrical landscape—on both sides of the Atlantic—over the past decade or so is that sightings of big star names turning out to do plays has gone up; but the runs they are prepared to commit to has gone down. Time was that a producer would require a minimum commitment from his star of six months, and perhaps a year; now, the 13-week run is the norm.\"The minimum size of the Broadway orchestra is governed by an agreement with the musicians\\' union (Local 802, American Federation of Musicians) and The Broadway League. For example, the agreement specifies the minimum size of the orchestra at the Minskoff Theatre to be 18, while at the Music Box Theatre it is 9.\\n\\nRuns\\nMost Broadway shows are commercial productions intended to make a profit for the producers and investors (\"backers\" or \"angels\"), and therefore have open-ended runs (duration that the production plays), meaning that the length of their presentation is not set beforehand, but depends on critical response, word of mouth, and the effectiveness of the show\\'s advertising, all of which determine ticket sales. Investing in a commercial production carries a varied degree of financial risk. Shows need not make a profit immediately; should they make their \"nut\" (weekly operating expenses), or lose money at a rate acceptable to the producers, they may continue to run in the expectation that, eventually, they will pay back their initial costs and become profitable. In some borderline situations, producers may ask that royalties be temporarily reduced or waived, or even that performers—with the permission of their unions—take reduced salaries, in order to prevent a show from closing. Theatre owners, who are not generally profit participants in most productions, may waive or reduce rents, or even lend a show money in order to keep it running.\\nSome Broadway shows are produced by non-commercial organizations as part of a regular subscription season—Lincoln Center Theatre, Roundabout Theatre Company, Manhattan Theatre Club, and Second Stage Theater are the four non-profit theatre companies that currently have permanent Broadway venues. Some other productions are produced on Broadway with \"limited engagement runs\" for a number of reasons, including financial issues, prior engagements of the performers or temporary availability of a theatre between the end of one production and the beginning of another. However, some shows with planned limited engagement runs may, after critical acclaim or box office success, extend their engagements or convert to open-ended runs. This was the case with 2007\\'s August: Osage County, 2009\\'s God of Carnage, and 2012\\'s Newsies.\\nHistorically, musicals on Broadway tend to have longer runs than \"straight\" (i.e., non-musical) plays. On January 9, 2006, The Phantom of the Opera at the Majestic Theatre became the longest running Broadway musical, with 7,486 performances, overtaking Cats.\\n\\nAudience\\nAttending a Broadway show is a common tourist activity in New York. The TKTS booths sell same-day tickets (and in certain cases, next-day matinee tickets) for many Broadway and Off-Broadway shows at a discount of 20 to 50%. The TKTS booths are located in Times Square, in Lower Manhattan, and at Lincoln Center. This service is run by Theatre Development Fund. Many Broadway theatres also offer special student rates, same-day \"rush\" or \"lottery\" tickets, or standing-room tickets to help ensure that their theatres are as full—and their grosses as high—as possible. According to The Broadway League, total Broadway attendance was 14.77 million in 2018–2019, compared to 13.79 million in 2017–2018. The Broadway League also reports that approximately 66% of all Broadway tickets were purchased by tourists in the 2012–2013 season, an increase of three percent from the 2011–2012 season. By way of comparison, London\\'s West End theatre reported total attendance of 15.5 million for major commercial and grant-aided theatres in central London for 2018. The average age of the Broadway audience in the 2017–18 theater season was 40, the lowest it had been in nearly two decades.\\n\\nOff-Broadway and US tours\\nThe classification of theatres is governed by language in Actors\\' Equity Association contracts. To be eligible for a Tony, a production must be in a house with 500 seats or more and in the Theater District, which are the criteria that define Broadway theatre. Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway shows often provide a more experimental, challenging, and intimate performance than is possible in the larger Broadway theatres. Some Broadway shows, however, such as the musicals Hair, Little Shop of Horrors, Spring Awakening, Next to Normal, Rent, Avenue Q, In the Heights, Fun Home, Dear Evan Hansen, and Hamilton, began their runs Off-Broadway and later transferred to Broadway, seeking to replicate their intimate experience in a larger theatre.\\nAfter, or even during, successful runs in Broadway theatres, producers often remount their productions with new casts and crew for the Broadway national tour, which travels to theatres in major cities across the country. Sometimes when a show closes on Broadway, the entire production, with most if not all of the original cast intact, is relaunched as a touring company, hence the name \"Broadway national tour\". Some shows may even have several touring companies out at a time, whether the show is still running in New York or not, with many companies \"sitting down\" in other major cities for their own extended runs.\\nSmaller cities may attract national touring companies, but for shorter periods of time or they may even be serviced by \"bus and truck\" tours. These are scaled-down versions of the larger, national touring productions, historically acquiring their name because the casts generally traveled by bus instead of by air, while the sets and equipment traveled by truck. Tours of this type, which frequently feature a reduced physical production to accommodate smaller venues and tighter schedules, often run for weeks rather than months. Some will even play \"split weeks\", which are half a week in one town and the second half in another. On occasion, they will also play \"one-nighters\". The production values are usually less lavish than the typical Broadway national tour or national touring production and the actors, while still members of the actor\\'s union, are compensated under a different, less lucrative union contract. The Touring Broadway Awards, presented by The Broadway League, honored excellence in touring Broadway.\\n\\nAwards\\nBroadway productions and artists are honored by the annual Antoinette Perry Awards (commonly called the \"Tony Awards\", or \"Tony\") which are given by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League, and which were first presented in 1947. The Tony is Broadway\\'s most prestigious award, comparable to the Academy Awards for Hollywood film productions. Their importance has increased since 1967 when the awards presentation show began to be broadcast on national television. In a strategy to improve the television ratings, celebrities are often chosen to host the show, some with scant connection to the theatre. The most recent Tony Awards ceremony was held on June 9, 2019. Other awards given to Broadway productions include the Drama Desk Award, presented since 1955, the New York Drama Critics\\' Circle Awards, first given in 1936, and the Outer Critics Circle Award, initially presented in 1950.\\n\\nBroadway theatres and current productions\\nAn * after the opening date indicates that the listed show has not yet opened, but is scheduled to open on the given date at that theatre.\\nAn * after the closing date indicates that there is another production scheduled for this theatre.\\nCapacity is based on the capacity given for the respective theatre at the Internet Broadway Database.\\n\\nUpcoming productions\\nThe following have been announced as future Broadway productions.

              " 'Cameron Crowe': 'Cameron Bruce Crowe (born July 13, 1957) is an American director, producer, screenwriter, journalist, author, and actor. Before moving into the film industry, Crowe was a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine, for which he still frequently writes.\\nCrowe\\'s debut screenwriting effort, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, grew out of a book he wrote while posing for one year undercover as a student at Clairemont High School in San Diego, California. Later, he wrote and directed another high school saga, Say Anything..., followed by Singles, a story of twentysomethings that was woven together by a soundtrack centering on Seattle\\'s burgeoning grunge music scene. In 1996, Crowe landed his biggest hit with Jerry Maguire. After this, he was given a green light to go ahead with a pet project, the autobiographical effort Almost Famous. Centering on a teenage music journalist on tour with an up-and-coming band, it gave insight to his life as a 15-year-old writer for Rolling Stone. For his screenplay, he won an Academy Award. In late 1999, Crowe\\'s second book was published, a question and answer session with the film director Billy Wilder entitled Conversations with Wilder.\\n\\nEarly life\\nCameron Crowe was born in Palm Springs, California. His father, James A. Crowe, originally from Kentucky, was a real estate agent. His mother, Alice Marie (née George), \"was a teacher, activist, and all-around live wire who did skits around the house and would wear a clown suit to school on special occasions.\" She worked as a psychology professor and in family therapy and often participated in peace demonstrations and causes relating to the rights of farm workers. Crowe\\'s grandfather was Greek. Crowe was the youngest of three children with two sisters; one died when he was young. The family moved around often but spent a lot of time in the desert town of Indio. Crowe commented that Indio was where \"people owned tortoises, not dogs\". His family finally settled in San Diego.\\nCrowe skipped kindergarten and two grades in elementary, and by the time he attended Catholic high school, he was quite a bit younger than the other students. To add to his alienation, he was often ill because he suffered from nephritis.Crowe began writing for the school newspaper and by the age of 13 was contributing music reviews for an underground publication, The San Diego Door. He began corresponding with Lester Bangs, who had left the Door to become editor at the national rock magazine Creem, and soon he was also submitting articles to Creem as well as Circus. Crowe graduated from the University of San Diego High School in 1972 at the age of 15. On a trip to Los Angeles, he met Ben Fong-Torres, the editor of Rolling Stone, who hired him to write for the magazine. He also joined the Rolling Stone staff as a contributing editor and became an associate editor. During this time, Crowe interviewed Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, the Eagles, Poco, Steely Dan, members of Led Zeppelin and more. Crowe was Rolling Stone\\'s youngest-ever contributor.\\n\\nCareer\\nRolling Stone\\nCrowe\\'s first cover story was on the Allman Brothers Band. He went on the road with them for three weeks at the age of 16 and interviewed the band and the road crew.\\nBecause Crowe was a fan of the 1970s hard rock bands that the older writers disliked, he landed a lot of major interviews. He wrote predominantly about Yes, and also about Led Zeppelin, Allman Brothers, Jackson Browne, Neil Young, the Eagles, Rod Stewart, Eric Clapton, Peter Frampton, Linda Ronstadt, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Fleetwood Mac, and others. Former colleague Sarah Lazin described of the youthful Crowe: \"He was a pleasure to work with, a total professional. He was easygoing and eager to learn. Obviously, the bands loved him.\" Then-senior editor Ben Fong-Torres also said of Crowe: \"He was the guy we sent out after some difficult customers. He covered the bands that hated Rolling Stone.\"\\n\\nFast Times at Ridgemont High book and film\\nWhen Rolling Stone moved its offices from California to New York in 1977, Crowe decided to stay behind. He also felt the excitement of his career was beginning to wane. Crowe appeared in the 1978 film American Hot Wax, but returned to his writing. Though he would continue to freelance for Rolling Stone on and off over the years, he turned his attention to a book.At the age of 22, Crowe came up with the idea to pose undercover as a high school student and write about his experiences. Simon & Schuster gave him a contract, and he moved back in with his parents and enrolled as Dave Cameron at Clairemont High School in San Diego. Reliving the senior year he never had, he made friends and began to fit in. Though he initially planned to include himself in the book, he realized that it would jeopardize his ability to capture the true essence of the high school experience.His fantasy book, Fast Times at Ridgemont High: A True Story, came out in 1981. Crowe focused on six main characters: a tough guy, a nerd, a surfer dude, a sexual sophisticate, and a middle-class brother and sister. He chronicled their activities in typical teenage settings—at school, at the beach, and at the mall, where many of them held afterschool jobs—and focused on details of their lives that probed into the heart of adolescence. This included scenes about homecoming and graduation as well as social cliques and sexual encounters.Before the book was released, Fast Times at Ridgemont High was optioned for a film. Released in 1982, the movie version lacked a specific plot and featured no major name stars. The studio did not devote any marketing effort toward it. It became a sleeper hit due to word of mouth.\\nThe reviews of Fast Times at Ridgemont High were positive, and the film ended up launching the careers of some of the previously unknown actors, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Eric Stoltz, Judge Reinhold, Phoebe Cates, Anthony Edwards, Nicolas Cage, Forest Whitaker, and Sean Penn.\\n\\nEarly film efforts\\nFollowing this success, Crowe wrote the screenplay for 1984\\'s The Wild Life, the pseudo-sequel to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Whereas its predecessor followed teenagers\\' lives in high school, The Wild Life traced the lives of several teenagers after high school living in an apartment complex. Filmmaker James L. Brooks noticed Crowe\\'s original voice and wanted to work with him. Brooks executive produced Crowe\\'s first directing effort, 1989\\'s Say Anything..., about a young man pining away for the affections of the seemingly perfect girl. Say Anything... was positively received by critics.\\nBy this point, Crowe was ready to leave teen angst behind and focus on his peers. His next project, 1992\\'s Singles, centered on the romantic tangles among a group of six friends in their twenties in Seattle. The film starred Bridget Fonda and Matt Dillon, where Fonda played a coffee-bar waitress fawning over an aspiring musician, played by Dillon. Kyra Sedgwick and Campbell Scott co-starred as a couple wavering on whether to commit to each other. Music forms an integral backbone for the script, and the soundtrack became a best seller three months before the release of the film. Much of this was due to repeated delays while studio executives debated how to market it.\\nSingles successfully rode on the heels of Seattle\\'s grunge music boom. During production, bands like Nirvana were not yet national stars, but by the time the soundtrack was released, their song \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" had to be cut because it was too costly to buy the rights. Crowe had signed members of Pearl Jam, shortly before their burgeoning, nationwide success, to portray Dillon\\'s fictional band \\'Citizen Dick\\'. Crowe also appeared in this project, as a rock journalist at a club. Tim Appelo wrote in Entertainment Weekly, \"With ... an ambling, naturalistic style, Crowe captures the eccentric appeal of a town where espresso carts sprout on every corner and kids in ratty flannel shirts can cut records that make them millionaires.\"\\n\\nJerry Maguire\\nBranching into a new direction, Crowe wrote and directed Jerry Maguire, about a highly paid pro sports agent, inspired by sports agent Leigh Steinberg. Maguire is fired after having a moral revelation, writing and distributing a mission statement calling for sincere service to the athletes and less money for the agency. He strikes out to form his own agency. Tom Cruise played the title role of Jerry and Cuba Gooding, Jr. played Rod Tidwell, an aging wide receiver, whose catchphrase, \"Show me the money!\", became culturally ubiquitous for a time. Renée Zellweger appeared as an accountant, who sets aside her job security to follow Maguire\\'s charismatic moral-aspiration, in both work and love. Gooding won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role, and the film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Editing, and Best Actor (for Cruise). Cruise also won his second Golden Globe for his role as Jerry.\\n\\nAlmost Famous\\nIn 2000, Crowe used his music journalism experience roots to write and direct Almost Famous, about the experiences of a teenage music journalist who goes on the road with an emerging band in the early 1970s. The film starred newcomer Patrick Fugit as William Miller, the baby-faced writer who finds himself immersed in the world of sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll, and Kate Hudson co-starred as Penny Lane, a prominent groupie, or, as the film refers to her, a \"Band-Aid\". Digging into his most personal memories, Crowe used a composite of the bands he had known to come up with Stillwater, the emerging act that welcomes the young journalist into its sphere, then becomes wary of his intentions. Seventies rocker Peter Frampton served as a technical consultant on the film.William Miller\\'s mother figured prominently in the film as well (often admonishing, \"Don\\'t take drugs!\"). The character was based on Crowe\\'s own mother, who even showed up at the film sets to keep an eye on him while he worked. Though he asked her not to bother Frances McDormand, who played her character, the two ended up getting along well. Also in the film he showed his sister, portrayed by Zooey Deschanel, rebelling and leaving home, and in real life, his mother and sister Cindy did not talk for a decade and were still estranged to a degree when he finished the film. The family reconciled when the project was complete.\\nIn addition, Crowe took a copy of the film to London for a special screening with Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. After the screening, Led Zeppelin granted Crowe the right to use one of their songs on the soundtrack—the first time they had ever consented to this since allowing Crowe to use \"Kashmir\" in Fast Times at Ridgemont High—and also gave him rights to four of their other songs in the movie itself, although they did not grant him the rights to \"Stairway to Heaven\" for an intended scene (on the special \"Bootleg\" edition DVD, the scene is included as an extra sans the song where the viewer is instructed by a watermark to begin playing it). Crowe and his then-wife, musician Nancy Wilson of Heart, co-wrote three of the five Stillwater songs in the film, and Frampton wrote the other two, with Mike McCready from Pearl Jam playing lead guitar on all of the Stillwater songs. Reviews were almost universally positive, and it was nominated for and won a host of film awards, including an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Crowe. Crowe and co-producer Danny Bramson also won the Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media Grammy Award for the soundtrack. Despite these accolades, box office returns for the film were disappointing.\\n\\nVanilla Sky\\nCrowe followed Almost Famous with the psychological thriller Vanilla Sky in 2001. The film, starring Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, received mixed reviews, yet managed to gross $100.6 million at the US box office, making it his second highest grossing directorial effort behind Jerry Maguire. Vanilla Sky is a remake of Alejandro Amenabar\\'s 1997 Spanish film Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). Sofia is played by Penélope Cruz in both Amenabar\\'s original movie and Crowe\\'s remake.\\n\\nElizabethtown\\nIn 2005, Crowe directed the romantic tragicomedy Elizabethtown, starring Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst, which opened to mixed reviews, scoring 45 on Metacritic, the same as his previous effort, Vanilla Sky.\\n\\nThe Union\\nIn November 2009, Crowe began filming a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the album The Union, a collaboration between musicians Elton John and Leon Russell produced by award-winning producer T-Bone Burnett. The documentary features musicians Neil Young, Brian Wilson, Booker T. Jones, steel guitarist Robert Randolph, Don Was and a 10-piece gospel choir who all appear on the album with John and Russell. Musician Stevie Nicks and John\\'s longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin also appear. On March 2, 2011, the documentary was announced to open the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival.\\n\\nWe Bought a Zoo\\nWith production on Aloha delayed, Crowe set his next feature, the family comedy-drama We Bought a Zoo, based on Benjamin Mee\\'s memoir of the same name. Crowe collaborated with The Devil Wears Prada writer Aline Brosh McKenna on the screenplay. The book\\'s story follows Mee, who buys and moves into a dilapidated zoo (now Dartmoor Zoological Park) in the English countryside. Looking for a fresh start along with his seven-year-old daughter and his troubled fourteen-year-old son, he hopes to refurbish the zoo and run it and to give his children what he calls an \"adventure\". Crowe changed the location to the United States. The film received a wide release on December 23, 2011, by 20th Century Fox, and starred Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson. The film received mixed reviews. The music of the movie was composed by Jonsi.\\n\\nPearl Jam Twenty\\nIn an interview with Pearl Jam on March 9, 2009, bassist Jeff Ament said \"... our manager Kelly has had the idea to do a 20-year anniversary retrospective movie so he\\'s been on board with [film director] Cameron Crowe for the last few years.\" The band\\'s guitarist Mike McCready also stated in March, \"We are just in the very early stages of that, . . . starting to go through all the footage we have, and Cameron’s writing the treatment.\" Preliminary footage was being shot as of June 2010.  A trailer for the movie, which featured Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder choosing between three permanent markers in a shop before turning to the camera and saying \"Three\\'s good... Twenty is better\", was shown before select movies at the 2011 BFI London Film Festival. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and also had an accompanying book and soundtrack.\\n\\nAloha\\nIt was announced in early June 2008 that Crowe would return to write and direct his seventh feature film, initially titled Deep Tiki and Volcano Romance, set to star Ben Stiller and Reese Witherspoon, and to be released by Columbia Pictures. Filming was expected to begin in January 2009, but this was then postponed.The project resurfaced in 2013. Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Rachel McAdams, Alec Baldwin, Bill Murray, John Krasinski and Danny McBride joined the cast of the film; filming began in Hawaii in September 2013. The film\\'s final title was Aloha and it was released on May 29, 2015 by Sony Pictures to negative critical reviews.\\n\\nRoadies\\nOn June 26, 2016, Crowe\\'s comedy-drama series Roadies premiered on Showtime. The show, starring Luke Wilson, Carla Gugino and Imogen Poots, tells the story of a colorful road crew who work behind the scenes for a fictional rock band, The Staton-House Band. The pilot episode was written and directed by Crowe, as well as the series finale.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nCrowe married Nancy Wilson of the rock band Heart in July 1986. Their twin sons were born in January 2000. Crowe and Wilson separated in June 2008 and Wilson filed for divorce on September 23, 2010, citing \"irreconcilable differences\". The divorce was finalized on December 8, 2010.\\n\\nFilmography\\nAs an actor\\nMusic videos\\nAwards and nominations received by Crowe movies\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website \\nCameron Crowe at IMDb',\n",
              " 'Chicago Tribune': 'The Chicago Tribune is a daily newspaper based in Chicago, Illinois, United States, owned by Tribune Publishing. Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the \"World\\'s Greatest Newspaper\" (a slogan for which WGN radio and television are named), it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region. It had the 6th highest circulation for American newspapers in 2017.In the 1850s, under Joseph Medill, the Chicago Tribune became closely associated with Illinois\\' favorite son, Abraham Lincoln, and with the Republican Party\\'s progressive wing. In the 20th century under Medill\\'s grandson, Robert R. McCormick, it achieved a reputation as a crusading paper with a decidedly more American-conservative anti-New Deal outlook, and its writing reached other markets through family and corporate relationships at the New York Daily News and the Washington Times-Herald. The 1960s saw its corporate parent owner, Tribune Company, reach into new markets. In 2008, for the first time in its over century-and-a-half history, its editorial page endorsed a Democrat, Illinoisan Barack Obama, for U.S. president.Originally published solely as a broadsheet, on January 13, 2009, the Tribune announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the Tribune discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its established broadsheet format through all distribution channels. In December 2019, Alden Global Capital, a New York City-based hedge fund, acquired a 32% stake in shares of Tribune Publishing Company.The Tribune\\'s masthead displays the American flag, in reference to the paper\\'s former motto, \"An American Paper for Americans\". The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead, where it was placed below the flag.\\n\\nHistory\\nBeginnings\\nThe Tribune was founded by James Kelly, John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the Tribune was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the Whig or Free Soil parties against the Democrats in elections. By late 1853, it was frequently running xenophobic editorials that criticized foreigners and Roman Catholics. About this time it also became a strong proponent of temperance. However nativist its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855, that the Tribune formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or Know Nothing party, whose candidate Levi Boone was elected Mayor of Chicago the following month.\\n\\nMedill editorship\\nBy about 1854, part-owner Capt. J. D. Webster, later General Webster and chief of staff at the Battle of Shiloh, and Dr. Charles H. Ray of Galena, Illinois, through Horace Greeley, convinced Joseph Medill of Cleveland\\'s Leader to become managing editor. Ray became editor-in-chief, Medill became the managing editor, and Alfred Cowles, Sr., brother of Edwin Cowles, initially was the bookkeeper. Each purchased one third of the Tribune. Under their leadership, the Tribune distanced itself from the Know Nothings, and became the main Chicago organ of the Republican Party. However, the paper continued to print anti-Catholic and anti-Irish editorials, in the wake of the massive Famine immigration from Ireland.The Tribune absorbed three other Chicago publications under the new editors: the Free West in 1855, the Democratic Press of William Bross in 1858, and the Chicago Democrat in 1861, whose editor, John Wentworth, left his position when elected as Mayor of Chicago. Between 1858 and 1860, the paper was known as the Chicago Press & Tribune. On October 25, 1860, it became the Chicago Daily Tribune. Before and during the American Civil War, the new editors strongly supported Abraham Lincoln, whom Medill helped secure the presidency in 1860, and pushed an abolitionist agenda. The paper remained a force in Republican politics for years afterwards.In 1861, the Tribune published new lyrics by William W. Patton for the song \"John Brown\\'s Body\". These rivaled the lyrics published two months later by Julia Ward Howe. Medill served as mayor of Chicago for one term after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\\n\\nYears of McCormick\\nUnder the 20th-century editorship of Colonel Robert R. McCormick, who took control in the 1920s, the paper was strongly isolationist and aligned with the Old Right in its coverage of political news and social trends. It used the motto \"The American Paper for Americans\". From the 1930s to the 1950s, it excoriated the Democrats and the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, was resolutely disdainful of the British and French, and greatly enthusiastic for Chiang Kai-shek and Sen. Joseph McCarthy.\\nWhen McCormick assumed the position of co-editor (with his cousin Joseph Medill Patterson) in 1910, the Tribune was the third-best-selling paper among Chicago\\'s eight dailies, with a circulation of only 188,000. The young cousins added features such as advice columns and homegrown comic strips such as Little Orphan Annie and Moon Mullins. They promoted political \"crusades\", with their first success coming with the ouster of the Republican political boss of Illinois, Sen. William Lorimer. At the same time, the Tribune competed with the Hearst paper, the Chicago Examiner, in a circulation war. By 1914, the cousins succeeded in forcing out Managing Editor William Keeley. By 1918, the Examiner was forced to merge with the Chicago Herald.\\n\\nIn 1919, Patterson left the Tribune and moved to New York to launch his own newspaper, the New York Daily News. In a renewed circulation war with Hearst\\'s Herald-Examiner, McCormick and Hearst ran rival lotteries in 1922. The Tribune won the battle, adding 250,000 readers to its ranks. Also in 1922, the Chicago Tribune hosted an international design competition for its new headquarters, the Tribune Tower. The competition worked brilliantly as a publicity stunt, and more than 260 entries were received. The winner was a neo-Gothic design by New York architects John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood.\\nThe newspaper sponsored a pioneering attempt at Arctic aviation in 1929, an attempted round-trip to Europe across Greenland and Iceland in a Sikorsky amphibious aircraft. But, the aircraft was destroyed by ice on July 15, 1929, near Ungava Bay at the tip of Labrador, Canada. The crew were rescued by the Canadian science ship CSS Acadia.The Tribune\\'s reputation for innovation extended to radio—it bought an early station, WDAP, in 1924 and renamed it WGN (AM), the station call letters standing for the paper\\'s self-description as the \"World\\'s Greatest Newspaper.\" WGN Television was launched April 5, 1948. These broadcast stations remained Tribune properties for nine decades and were among the oldest newspaper/broadcasting cross-ownerships in the country. (The Tribune\\'s East Coast sibling, the New York Daily News, later established WPIX television and radio.)\\nThe Tribune\\'s legendary sports editor Arch Ward created the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1933 as part of the city\\'s Century of Progress exposition.\\nFrom 1940 to 1943, the paper supplemented its comic strip offerings with The Chicago Tribune Comic Book, responding to the new success of comic books. At the same time, it launched the more successful and longer lasting The Spirit Section, which was also an attempt by newspapers to compete with the new medium.Under McCormick\\'s stewardship, the Tribune was a champion of modified spelling for simplicity (such as spelling \"although\" as \"altho\"). McCormick, a vigorous campaigner for the Republican Party, died in 1955, just four days before Democratic boss Richard J. Daley was elected mayor for the first time.\\nOne of the great scoops in Tribune history came when it obtained the text of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919. Another was its revelation of United States war plans on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack. The Tribune\\'s June 7, 1942, front page announcement that the United States had broken Japan\\'s naval code was the revelation by the paper of a closely guarded military secret. The story revealing that Americans broke the enemy naval codes was not cleared by censors, and had U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt so enraged that he considered shutting down the Tribune.\\n\\n1948 U.S. presidential election\\nThe paper is well known for a mistake it made during the 1948 presidential election. At that time, much of its composing room staff was on strike. The early returns led editors to believe (along with many in the country) that the Republican candidate Thomas Dewey would win. An early edition of the next day\\'s paper carried the headline \"Dewey Defeats Truman\", turning the paper into a collector\\'s item. Democrat Harry S. Truman won and proudly brandished the newspaper in a famous picture taken at St. Louis Union Station. Beneath the headline was a false article, written by Arthur Sears Henning, which purported to describe West Coast results although written before East Coast election returns were available.\\n\\nPulitzer Prizes\\nColonel McCormick prevented the Tribune for years from participating in the Pulitzer Prize competition. But it has won 25 of the awards over the years, including many for editorial writing. The Tribune won its first post-McCormick Pulitzer in 1961, when Carey Orr won the award for editorial cartooning. Reporter George Bliss won a Pulitzer the following year for reporting, and reporter Bill Jones another in 1971 for reporting. A reporting team won the award in 1973, followed by reporter William Mullen and photographer Ovie Carter, who won a Pulitzer for international reporting in 1975. A local reporting team won the award in 1976, and architecture critic Paul Gapp won a Pulitzer in 1979.\\n\\nThe Watergate years\\nIn 1969, under the leadership of publisher Harold Grumhaus and editor Clayton Kirkpatrick (1915–2004), the Tribune began reporting from a wider viewpoint. The paper retained its Republican and conservative perspective in its editorials, but it began to publish perspectives in wider commentary that represented a spectrum of diverse opinions, while its news reporting no longer had the conservative slant it had in the McCormick years.\\nOn May 1, 1974, in a major feat of journalism, the Tribune published the complete 246,000-word text of the Watergate tapes, in a 44-page supplement that hit the streets 24 hours after the transcripts\\' release by the Nixon White House. Not only was the Tribune the first newspaper to publish the transcripts, but it beat the U.S. Government Printing Office\\'s published version, and made headlines doing so.A week later, after studying the transcripts, the paper\\'s editorial board observed that \"the high dedication to grand principles that Americans have a right to expect from a President is missing from the transcript record.\" The Tribune\\'s editors concluded that \"nobody of sound mind can read [the transcripts] and continue to think that Mr. Nixon has upheld the standards and dignity of the Presidency,\" and called for Nixon\\'s resignation. The Tribune call for Nixon to resign made news, reflecting not only the change in the type of conservatism practiced by the paper, but as a watershed event in terms of Nixon\\'s hopes for survival in office. The White House reportedly perceived the Tribune\\'s editorial as a loss of a long-time supporter and as a blow to Nixon\\'s hopes to weather the scandal.\\nOn December 7, 1975, Kirkpatrick announced in a column on the editorial page that Rick Soll, a \"young and talented columnist\" for the paper, whose work had \"won a following among many Tribune readers over the last two years\", had resigned from the paper. He had acknowledged that a November 23, 1975 column he wrote contained verbatim passages written by another columnist in 1967 and later published in a collection. Kirkpatrick did not identify the columnist. The passages in question, Kirkpatrick wrote, were from a notebook where Soll regularly entered words, phrases and bits of conversation which he had wished to remember. The paper initially suspended Soll for a month without pay. Kirkpatrick wrote that further evidence was revealed came out that another of Soll\\'s columns contained information which he knew was false. At that point, Tribune editors decided to accept the resignation offered by Soll when the internal investigation began.After leaving, Soll married Pam Zekman, a Chicago newspaper (and future TV) reporter. He worked for the short-lived Chicago Times magazine in the late 1980s.\\nIn January 1977, Tribune columnist Will Leonard died at age 64.In March 1978, the Tribune announced that it hired columnist Bob Greene from the Chicago Sun-Times.\\n\\n1980s and 1990s\\nKirkpatrick stepped down as editor in 1979 and was succeeded by Maxwell McCrohon (1928–2004), who served as editor until 1981. He was transitioned to a corporate position. McCrohon held the corporate position until 1983, when he left to become editor-in-chief of the United Press International. James Squires served as the paper\\'s editor from July 1981 until December 1989.\\nJack Fuller served as the Tribune\\'s editor from 1989 until 1993, when he became the president and chief executive officer of the Chicago Tribune. Howard Tyner served as the Tribune\\'s editor from 1993 until 2001, when he was promoted to vice president/editorial for Tribune Publishing.\\nThe Tribune won 11 Pulitzer prizes during the 1980s and 1990s. Editorial cartoonist Dick Locher won the award in 1983, and editorial cartoonist Jeff MacNelly won one in 1985. Then, future editor Jack Fuller won a Pulitzer for editorial writing in 1986. In 1987, reporters Jeff Lyon and Peter Gorner won a Pulitzer for explanatory reporting, and in 1988, Dean Baquet, William Gaines and Ann Marie Lipinski won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting. In 1989, Lois Wille won a Pulitzer for editorial writing and Clarence Page snagged the award for commentary. In 1994, Ron Kotulak won a Pulitzer for explanatory journalism, while R. Bruce Dold won it for editorial writing. In 1998, reporter Paul Salopek won a Pulitzer for explanatory writing, and in 1999, architecture critic Blair Kamin won it for criticism.In September 1981, baseball writer Jerome Holtzman was hired by the Tribune after a 38-year career at the Sun-Times.\\nIn November 1982, Tribune managing editor William H. \"Bill\" Jones, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1971, died at age 43 of cardiac arrest as a result of complications from a long battle with leukemia.In May 1983, Tribune columnist Aaron Gold died at age 45 of complications from leukemia. Gold had coauthored the Tribune\\'s \"Inc.\" column with Michael Sneed and prior to that had written the paper\\'s \"Tower Ticker\" column.\\nThe Tribune scored a coup in 1984 when it hired popular columnist Mike Royko away from the rival Sun-Times.In 1986, the Tribune announced that film critic Gene Siskel, the Tribune\\'s best-known writer, was no longer the paper\\'s film critic, and that his position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film critic to that of a freelance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews for the paper\\'s entertainment sections. The demotion occurred after Siskel and longtime Chicago film critic colleague Roger Ebert decided to shift the production of their weekly movie-review show—then known as At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert and later known as Siskel & Ebert & The Movies—from Tribune Entertainment to The Walt Disney Company\\'s Buena Vista Television unit. \"He has done a great job for us,\" editor James Squires said at the time. \"It\\'s a question of how much a person can do physically. We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can\\'t do that.\" Siskel declined to comment on the new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel\\'s Tribune bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment. Siskel remained in that freelance position until he died in 1999. He was replaced as film critic by Dave Kehr.In February 1988, Tribune foreign correspondent Jonathan Broder resigned after a February 22, 1988 Tribune article written by Broder contained a number of sentences and phrases taken, without attribution, from a column written by another writer, Joel Greenberg, that had been published 10 days earlier in The Jerusalem Post.In August 1988, Chicago Tribune reporter Michael Coakley died at age 41 of complications from AIDS.In November 1992, Tribune associate subject editor Searle \"Ed\" Hawley was arrested by Chicago police and charged with seven counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for allegedly having sex with three juveniles in his home in Evanston, Illinois. Hawley formally resigned from the paper in early 1993, and pleaded guilty in April 1993. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison.In an unusual move at that time, the Tribune in October 1993 fired its longtime military-affairs writer, retired-Marine David Evans, with the public position that the post of military affairs was being dropped in favor of having a national security writer.In December 1993, the Tribune\\'s longtime Washington, D.C. bureau chief, Nicholas Horrock, was removed from his post after he chose not to attend a meeting that editor Howard Tyner requested of him in Chicago. Horrock, who shortly thereafter left the paper, was replaced by James Warren, who attracted new attention to the Tribune\\'s D.C. bureau through his continued attacks on celebrity broadcast journalists in Washington.\\nAlso in December 1993, the Tribune hired Margaret Holt from the South Florida Sun-Sentinel as its assistant managing editor for sports, making her the first female to head a sports department at any of the nation\\'s 10 largest newspapers. In mid-1995, Holt was replaced as sports editor by Tim Franklin and shifted to a newly created job, customer service editor.In 1994, reporter Brenda You was fired by the Tribune after free-lancing for supermarket tabloid newspapers and lending them photographs from the Tribune\\'s photo library. You later worked for the National Enquirer and as a producer for The Jerry Springer Show before committing suicide in November 2005.In April 1994, the Tribune\\'s new television critic, Ken Parish Perkins, wrote an article about then-WFLD morning news anchor Bob Sirott in which Perkins quoted Sirott as making a statement that Sirott later denied making. Sirott criticized Perkins on the air, and the Tribune later printed a correction acknowledging that Sirott had never made that statement. Eight months later, Perkins stepped down as TV critic, and he left the paper shortly thereafter.In December 1995, the alternative newsweekly Newcity published a first-person article by the pseudonymous Clara Hamon (a name mentioned in the play The Front Page) but quickly identified by Tribune reporters as that of former Tribune reporter Mary Hill that heavily criticized the paper\\'s one-year residency program. The program brought young journalists in and out of the paper for one-year stints, seldom resulting in a full-time job. Hill, who wrote for the paper from 1992 until 1993, acknowledged to the Chicago Reader that she had written the diatribe originally for the Internet, and that the piece eventually was edited for Newcity.In 1997, the Tribune celebrated its 150th anniversary in part by tapping longtime reporter Stevenson Swanson to edit the book Chicago Days: 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City.\\nOn April 29, 1997, popular columnist Mike Royko died of a brain aneurysm. On September 2, 1997, the Tribune promoted longtime City Hall reporter John Kass to take Royko\\'s place as the paper\\'s principal Page Two news columnist.On June 1, 1997, the Tribune published what ended up becoming a very popular column by Mary Schmich called \"Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young,\" otherwise known as \"Wear Sunscreen\" or the \"Sunscreen Speech.\" The most popular and well-known form of the essay is the successful music single released in 1999, accredited to Baz Luhrmann.\\nIn 1998, reporter Jerry Thomas was fired by the Tribune after he wrote a cover article on boxing promoter Don King for Emerge magazine at the same time that he was writing a cover article on King for the Chicago Tribune Sunday magazine. The paper decided to fire Thomas—and suspend his photographer on the Emerge story, Pulitzer Prize-winning Tribune photographer Ovie Carter for a month—because Thomas did not tell the Tribune about his outside work and also because the Emerge story wound up appearing in print first.On June 6, 1999, the Tribune published a first-person travel article from freelance writer Gaby Plattner that described a supposed incident in which a pilot for Air Zimbabwe who was flying without a copilot inadvertently locked himself out of his cockpit while the plane was flying on autopilot and as a result needed to use a large ax to chop a hole in the cockpit door. An airline representative wrote a lengthy letter to the paper calling the account \"totally untrue, unprofessional and damaging to our airline\" and explaining that Air Zimbabwe does not keep axes on its aircraft and never flies without a full crew, and the paper was forced to print a correction stating that Plattner \"now says that she passed along a story she had heard as something she had experienced.\"The Tribune has been a leader on the Internet, acquiring 10 percent of America Online in the early 1990s, then launching such web sites as Chicagotribune.com (1995), Metromix.com (1996), ChicagoSports.com (1999), ChicagoBreakingNews.com (2008), and ChicagoNow (2009). In 2002, the paper launched a tabloid edition targeted at 18- to 34-year-olds known as RedEye.\\n\\n2000s\\nAnn Marie Lipinski was the paper\\'s editor from February 2001 until stepping down on July 17, 2008. Gerould W. Kern was named the paper\\'s editor in July 2008. In early August 2008, managing editor for news Hanke Gratteau resigned, and several weeks later, managing editor for features James Warren resigned as well. Both were replaced by Jane Hirt, who previously had been the editor of the Tribune\\'s RedEye tabloid.In June 2000, Times Mirror merged with Tribune Company making The Baltimore Sun and its community papers Baltimore Sun Media Group / Patuxent Publishing a subsidiary of Tribune.In July 2000, Tribune outdoors columnist John Husar, who had written about his need for a new liver transplant, died at age 63, just over a week after receiving part of a new liver from a live donor.Tribune\\'s Baltimore Community papers include Arbutus Times, Baltimore Messenger, Catonsville Times, Columbia Flier, Howard County Times, The Jeffersonian, Laurel Leader, Lifetimes, North County News, Northeast Booster, Northeast Reporter, Owings Mills Times, and Towson Times.\\nThe Howard County Times was named 2010 Newspaper of the Year by the Suburban Newspaper Association.The Towson Times expands coverage beyond the Towson area and includes Baltimore County government and politics.The Tribune won five Pulitzer prizes in the first decade of the 21st century. Salopek won his second Pulitzer for the Tribune in 2001 for international reporting, and that same year an explanatory reporting team—lead writers of which were Louise Kiernan, Jon Hilkevitch, Laurie Cohen, Robert Manor, Andrew Martin, John Schmeltzer, Alex Rodriguez and Andrew Zajac—won the honor for a profile of the chaotic U.S. air traffic system. In 2003, editorial writer Cornelia Grumman snagged the award for editorial writing. In 2005, Julia Keller won a Pulitzer for feature reporting on a tornado that struck Utica, Illinois. And, in 2008, an investigative reporting team including Patricia Callahan, Maurice Possley, Sam Roe, Ted Gregory, Michael Oneal, Evan Osnos and photojournalist Scott Strazzante won the Pulitzer for its series about faulty government regulation of defective toys, cribs and car seats.In late 2001, sports columnist Michael Holley announced he was leaving the Tribune after just two months because he was homesick. He ultimately returned to The Boston Globe, where he had been working immediately before the Tribune had hired him.On September 15, 2002, Lipinski wrote a terse, page-one note informing readers that the paper\\'s longtime columnist, Bob Greene, resigned effective immediately after acknowledging \"engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct some years ago with a girl in her late teens whom he met in connection with his newspaper column.\" The conduct later was revealed to have occurred in 1988 with a woman who was of the age of consent in Illinois. \"Greene\\'s behavior was a serious violation of Tribune ethics and standards for its journalists,\" Lipinski wrote. \"We deeply regret the conduct, its effect on the young woman and the impact this disclosure has on the trust our readers placed in Greene and this newspaper.\"In January 2003, Mike Downey, formerly of the Los Angeles Times, was hired as new Tribune sports columnist. He and colleague Rick Morrissey would write the In the Wake of the News Column originated by Ring Lardner.\\nIn March 2004, the Tribune announced that freelance reporter Uli Schmetzer, who retired from the Tribune in 2002 after 16 years as a foreign correspondent, had fabricated the name and occupation of a person he had quoted in a story. The paper terminated Schmetzer as a contract reporter and began a review of the 300 stories that Schmetzer had written over the prior three years.In May 2004, the Tribune revealed that freelance reporter Mark Falanga was unable to verify some facts that he inserted in a lifestyle-related column that ran on April 18, 2004, about an expensive lunch at a Chicago restaurant—namely, that the restaurant charged $15 for a bottle of water and $35 for a pasta entree. \"Upon questioning, the freelance writer indicated the column was based on an amalgam of three restaurants and could not verify the prices,\" the paper noted. After the correction, the Tribune stopped using Falanga.\\nIn October 2004, Tribune editor Ann Marie Lipinski at the last minute spiked a story written for the paper\\'s WomanNews section by freelance reporter Lisa Bertagnoli titled \"You c_nt say that (or can you?),\" about a noted vulgarism. The paper ordered every spare body to go to the Tribune\\'s printing plant to pull already-printed WomanNews sections containing the story from the October 27, 2004, package of preprinted sections in the Tribune.In September 2008, the Tribune considered hiring controversial sports columnist Jay Mariotti, shortly after his abrupt resignation from Tribune archrival Chicago Sun-Times. Discussions ultimately ended, however, after the Sun-Times threatened to sue for violating Mariotti\\'s noncompete agreement, which was to run until August 2009. Sports columnist Rick Morrissey defected to the Sun-Times in December 2009.\\nIn April 2009, 55 Tribune reporters and editors signed their names to an e-mail sent to Kern and managing editor Jane Hirt, questioning why the newspaper\\'s marketing department had solicited subscribers\\' opinions on stories before they were published, and suggesting that the practice raised ethical questions as well as legal and competitive issues. Reporters declined to speak on the record to the Associated Press about their issues. \"We\\'ll let the e-mail speak for itself,\" reporter John Chase told the AP. In the wake of the controversy, Kern abruptly discontinued the effort, which he described as \"a brief market research project.\"In the first decade of the 21st century, the Tribune had multiple rounds of reductions of staff through layoffs and buyouts as it has coped with the industrywide declines in advertising revenues:\\n\\nIn December 2005, the Tribune eliminated 28 editorial positions through a combination of buyouts and layoffs, including what were believed to be the first layoffs in the paper\\'s history. Among the reporters who left the paper in that round were Carol Kleiman, Bill Jauss and Connie Lauerman.\\nIn June 2007, about 25 newsroom employees took buyouts, including well-known bylines like Charles Madigan, Michael Hirsley and Ronald Kotulak, along with noted photographer Pete Souza.\\nIn March 2008, the paper gave buyouts to about 25 newsroom employees, including sportswriter Sam Smith.\\nOn August 15, 2008, the Tribune laid-off more than 40 newsroom and other editorial employees, including reporters Rick Popely, Ray Quintanilla, Lew Freedman, Michael Martinez and Robert Manor.\\nAlso in August 2008, about 36 editorial employees took voluntary buyouts or resigned, including well-known bylines like Michael Tackett, Ron Silverman, Timothy McNulty, Ed Sherman, Evan Osnos, Steve Franklin, Maurice Possley, Hanke Gratteau, Chuck Osgood and Skip Myslenski.\\nOn November 12, 2008, five editorial employees in the paper\\'s Washington, D.C. bureau were laid off, including John Crewdson.\\nOn December 4, 2008, about 11 newsroom employees were laid-off, with one sports columnist, Mike Downey, having departed several weeks earlier when his contract was not renewed. Well-known bylines who were laid off included Neil Milbert, Stevenson Swanson, Lisa Anderson, Phil Marty, Charles Storch, Courtney Flynn and Deborah Horan.\\nIn February 2009, the Tribune laid off about 20 editorial employees, including several foreign correspondents, and some feature reporters and editors, although several, including Charles Leroux and Jeff Lyon, technically took buyouts. Among those who were let go were reporters Emily Nunn, Susan Chandler, Christine Spolar and Joel Greenberg.\\nOn April 22, 2009, the paper laid off 53 newsroom employees, including well-known bylines like Patrick Reardon, Melissa Isaacson, Russell Working, Jo Napolitano, Susan Diesenhouse, Beth Botts, Lou Carlozo, Jessica Reaves, Tom Hundley, Alan Artner, Eric Benderoff, James P. Miller, Bob Sakamoto, Terry Bannon and John Mullin. That number was less than the 90 newsroom jobs that Crain\\'s Chicago Business previously had reported were to be eliminated.The Tribune broke the story on May 29, 2009, that several students had been admitted to the University of Illinois based upon connections or recommendations by the school\\'s Board of Trustees, Chicago politicians, and members of the Rod Blagojevich administration. Initially denying the existence of a so-called \"Category I\" admissions program, university President B. Joseph \"Joe\" White and Chancellor Richard Herman later admitted that there were instances of preferential treatment. Although they claimed the list was short and their role was minor, the Tribune, in particular, revealed emails through a FOIA finding that White had received a recommendation for a relative of convicted fundraiser Tony Rezko to be admitted. The Tribune also later posted emails from Herman pushing for underqualified students to be accepted. The Tribune has since filed suit against the university administration under the Freedom of Information Act to acquire the names of students benefited by administrative clout and impropriety.\\n\\n2010s\\nOn February 8, 2010, the Chicago Tribune shrank its newspaper\\'s width by an inch. They said that the new format was becoming the industry standard and that there would be minimal content changes.\\nIn July 2011, the Chicago Tribune underwent its first round of layoffs of editorial employees in more than two years, letting go about 20 editors and reporters. Among those let go were DuPage County reporter Art Barnum, Editorial Board member Pat Widder and photographer Dave Pierini.On March 15, 2012, the Tribune laid off 15 editorial staffers, including security guard Wendell Smothers (Smothers then died on November 12, 2012). At the same time, the paper gave buyouts to six editorial staffers, including Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter William Mullen, Barbara Mahany and Nancy Reese.In June 2012, the Tribune\\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning cultural critic Julia Keller left the paper to join the faculty of Ohio University and to pursue a career as a novelist.In September 2012, Tribune education reporter Joel Hood resigned from the paper to become a real estate broker, City Hall reporter Kristen Mack left the paper to become press secretary for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, and the Tribune hired Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer John J. Kim from the Chicago Sun-Times.In October 2012, the Tribune\\'s science and medicine reporter, Trine Tsouderos, quit to join a public relations firm.Also in October 2012, the Tribune announced plans to create a pay wall for its website, offering digital-only subscriptions at $14.99 per month, starting on November 1, 2012. Seven-day print subscribers would continue to have unlimited online access at no additional charge.In late February 2013, the Tribune agreed to pay a total of $660,000 to settle a class-action lawsuit that had been filed against the paper by 46 current and former reporters of its TribLocal local-news reporting group over unpaid overtime wages. The suit had been filed in federal court on behalf of Carolyn Rusin, who had been a TribLocal staff reporter from July 2010 until October 2011. The paper\\'s TribLocal unit had been formed in 2007 and uses staff reporters, freelance writers and user-generated content to produce hyperlocal Chicago-area community news.On June 12, 2013, the Boston Marathon bombing moving tribute was posted again, which showed the words \"We are Chicago\" above the names of Boston sports teams. On the graphic on June 12, the word \"Bruins\" was ripped off and the comment was added, \"Yeah, not right now we\\'re not\", in a reference to the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals, which play the Chicago Blackhawks against the Boston Bruins. Gerould Kern tweeted later that the Tribune \"still supports [Boston] after all you\\'ve been through. We regret any offense. Now let\\'s play hockey.\"On November 20, 2013, the Tribune laid off another 12 or so editorial staffers.On April 6, 2014, the Tribune increased the newsstand price of its Sunday/Thanksgiving Day paper by 50 percent to $2.99 for a single copy. The newsrack price increased $0.75, or 42.9%, to $2.50. By January 2017 the price increased again, up $1 or 40% at newsracks, to $3.50. At newsstands it went up also $1, or 33.3%, to $3.99.\\nOn January 28, 2015, metropolitan editor Peter Kendall was named managing editor, replacing Jane Hirt, who had resigned several months earlier. Colin McMahon was named associate editor.On February 18, 2016, the Tribune announced the retirement of editor Gerould Kern and the immediate promotion of the paper\\'s editorial page editor, R. Bruce Dold, to be the Tribune\\'s editor.\\n\\n2020s\\nOn February 27, 2020, the Tribune announced that publisher and editor Bruce Dold will leave the Tribune on April 30, 2020 and would step down immediately as editor in chief. His replacement as editor is Colin McMahon. Also, the paper announced that one of the two managing editors of the paper, Peter Kendall, would leave the Tribune on February 28, 2020.\\n\\nEditorial policy\\nIn a 2007 statement of principles published in the Tribune\\'s print and online editions, the paper\\'s editorial board described the newspaper\\'s philosophy, from which is excerpted the following:\\n\\nThe Chicago Tribune believes in the traditional principles of limited government; maximum individual responsibility; minimum restriction of personal liberty, opportunity and enterprise. It believes in free markets, free will and freedom of expression. These principles, while traditionally conservative, are guidelines and not reflexive dogmas.\\nThe Tribune brings a Midwestern sensibility to public debate. It is suspicious of untested ideas.\\n\\nThe Tribune places great emphasis on the integrity of government and the private institutions that play a significant role in society. The newspaper does this in the belief that the people cannot consent to be governed unless they have knowledge of, and faith in, the leaders and operations of government. The Tribune embraces the diversity of people and perspectives in its community. It is dedicated to the future of the Chicago region.\\nThe Tribune has remained economically conservative, being widely skeptical of increasing the minimum wage and entitlement spending. Although the Tribune criticized the Bush administration\\'s record on civil liberties, the environment, and many aspects of its foreign policy, it continued to support his presidency while taking Democrats, such as Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and Cook County Board President Todd Stroger, to task and calling for their removal from office.\\nIn 2004, the Tribune endorsed President George W. Bush for re-election, a decision consistent with its longstanding support for the Republican Party. In 2008, it endorsed Democratic candidate and Illinois junior U.S. Senator Barack Obama—the first time that it had ever endorsed a Democrat for president. The Tribune endorsed Obama once again for reelection in 2012, and in 2020 would endorse another Democrat, Joe Biden, who had served as vice president under Obama.The Tribune has occasionally backed independent candidates for president. In 1872, it supported Horace Greeley, a former Republican Party newspaper editor, and in 1912 the paper endorsed Theodore Roosevelt, who ran on the Progressive Party slate against Republican President William Howard Taft. In 2016, the Tribune endorsed the Libertarian Party candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, for president, over Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.Over the years, the Tribune has endorsed some Democrats for lesser offices, including recent endorsements of Bill Foster, Barack Obama for the Senate and Democrat Melissa Bean, who defeated Philip Crane, the House of Representatives\\' longest-serving Republican. Although the Tribune endorsed George Ryan in the 1998 Illinois gubernatorial race, the paper subsequently investigated and reported on the scandals surrounding Ryan during his preceding years as Secretary of State. Ryan declined to run for re-election in 2002 and was subsequently indicted, convicted and imprisoned as a result of the scandal.\\nAs of 2018, the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times have taken down their websites in most European countries due to GDPR, despite the newspapers having had two years to prepare for it.\\n\\nTribune Company\\nThe Chicago Tribune is the founding business unit of Tribune Company (since renamed Tribune Media), which included many newspapers and television stations around the country. In Chicago, Tribune Media owns the WGN radio station (720 AM) and WGN-TV (Channel 9). Tribune Company also owned the Los Angeles Times—which displaced the Tribune as the company\\'s largest property—and the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The Cubs were sold in 2009; the newspapers spun off in 2014 as Tribune Publishing and, later, Tronc.\\nTribune Company owned the New York Daily News from its 1919 founding until its 1991 sale to British newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell. The founder of the News, Capt. Joseph Medill Patterson, was a grandson of Joseph Medill and a cousin of Tribune editor Robert McCormick. Both Patterson and McCormick were enthusiasts of simplified spelling, another hallmark of their papers for many years. In 2008, the Tribune Company sold the Long Island newspaper Newsday—founded in 1940 by Patterson\\'s daughter (and Medill\\'s great-granddaughter), Alicia Patterson—to Long Island cable TV company Cablevision.\\nFrom 1925 to 2018, the Chicago Tribune was housed in the Tribune Tower on North Michigan Avenue on the Magnificent Mile. The building is neo-Gothic in style, and the design was the winner of an international competition hosted by the Tribune. The Chicago Tribune moved in June 2018 to the Prudential Plaza office complex overlooking Millennium Park after Tribune Media sold Tribune Tower to developers.\\n\\nColumnists\\n2008 redesign\\nThe September 2008 redesign (discussed on the Tribune\\'s web site) was controversial and is largely regarded as an effort in cost-cutting. Since then the newspaper has returned to a more toned down style. The style is more a mix of the old style and a new modern style.\\n\\nZell ownership and bankruptcy\\nIn December 2007, the Tribune Company was bought out by Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell in an $8.2 billion deal. Zell was the company\\'s new chairman. A year after going private, following a $124 million third-quarter loss, the Tribune Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 8, 2008. The company made its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, citing a debt of $13 billion and assets of $7.6 billion.Sam Zell originally planned to turn the company into a private company through the creation of an ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) within the company, but due to poor management that existed prior to his ownership, this did not work out as well as he intended.As part of its bankruptcy plan, owner Sam Zell intended to sell the Cubs to reduce debt. This sale has become linked to the corruption charges leading to the December 9, 2008, arrest of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Specifically, the ex-governor was accused of exploiting the paper\\'s financial trouble in an effort to have several editors fired.In the bankruptcy, unsecured bondholders of Tribune Co. essentially claimed that ordinary Tribune shareholders participated in a \"fraudulent transfer\" of wealth.The law firm Brown Rudnick, representing the Aurelius group of junior creditors, filed fraudulent transfer claims and fraud claims against 33,000 to 35,000 stockholders who bought Tribune stock. Prolonged due to these claims against former officers, directors, and every former stockholder of the Chicago Tribune Company, the Tribune\\'s bankruptcy-related legal and professional fees of $500 million were more than twice the usual amount for that size of company.The Tribune Co. emerged from bankruptcy in January 2013, partially owned by private equity firms which had speculated on its distressed debt. The reorganized company\\'s plan included selling off many of its assets.\\n\\nTribune Publishing divestment\\nTribune Publishing, owning the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, and eight other newspapers, was spun off as a separate publicly traded company in August 2014. The parent Tribune Company was renamed Tribune Media. Tribune Publishing started life with a $350 million loan, $275 million of which was paid as a dividend to Tribune Media. The publishing company was also due to lease its office space from Tribune Media for $30 million per year through 2017.Spinning off Tribune Publishing avoided the capital gains taxes that would accrue from selling those assets. The shares in Tribune Publishing were given tax-free to stakeholders in Tribune Media, the largest shareholder was Oaktree Capital Management with 18.5%. Tribune Media, retaining the non-newspaper broadcasting, entertainment, real estate, and other investments, also sold off some of the non-newspaper properties.\\n\\nSee also\\nChicago Tribune Silver Basketball\\nChicago Tribune Silver Football\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nKeefe, Thomas M.

              " 'Claus von Stauffenberg': 'Claus Philipp Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (German: [klaʊ̯s ʃɛŋk ɡʁaːf fɔn ˈʃtaʊ̯fn̩.bɛʁk] (listen); 15 November 1907 – 21 July 1944) was a German army officer best known for his failed attempt on 20 July 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler at the Wolf\\'s Lair and remove the Nazi Party from power. Along with Henning von Tresckow and Hans Oster, he was one of the central figures of the German resistance to Nazism within the Wehrmacht. For his involvement in the movement, he was executed by firing squad shortly after Operation Valkyrie.\\nHe held the hereditary titles of \"Graf\" (count) and \"Schenk\" (cupbearer). He took part in the attack on Poland, the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the Tunisian Campaign during the Second World War.\\n\\nFamily history\\nStauffenberg\\'s full name was Claus Philipp Maria Justinian, followed by the noble title of \"Count of Stauffenberg\". He was born in the Stauffenberg Castle Jettingen between Ulm and Augsburg, in the eastern part of Swabia, at that time in the Kingdom of Bavaria, part of the German Empire. Stauffenberg was the third of four sons, including the twins Berthold and Alexander and his own twin brother Konrad Maria, who died in Jettingen one day after birth on 16 November 1907. His father was Alfred Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, the last Oberhofmarschall of the Kingdom of Württemberg. Stauffenberg\\'s mother was Caroline Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, née Gräfin von Üxküll-Gyllenband, the daughter of Alfred Richard August Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband and Valerie Gräfin von \\nHohenthal.The titles \"Graf\" and \"Gräfin\" define count and countess, respectively. Schenk (i.e., cupbearer/butler) was an additional hereditary noble title. The ancestral castle of the nobility was the last part of the title, which was Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg and used as part of the name. The Stauffenberg family is one of the oldest and most distinguished aristocratic Catholic families of southern Germany. Among his maternal Protestant ancestors were several famous Prussians, including Field Marshal August von Gneisenau.On 11 November 1919, a new constitutional law, as part of the Weimar Republic, abolished the privileges of nobility. Article 109 also stated, \"Legal privileges or disadvantages based on birth or social standing are to be abolished. Noble titles form part of the name only; noble titles may not be granted any more.\"\\n\\nEarly life\\nIn his youth, he and his brothers were members of the Neupfadfinder, a German Scout association and part of the German Youth movement.\\n\\nLike his brothers, he was carefully educated and inclined toward literature, but eventually took up a military career. In 1926, he joined the family\\'s traditional regiment, the Bamberger Reiter- und Kavallerieregiment 17 (17th Cavalry Regiment) in Bamberg. It was around this time that the three brothers were introduced by Albrecht von Blumenthal to the poet Stefan George\\'s influential circle, Georgekreis, from which many notable members of the German resistance later emerged. George dedicated Das neue Reich (\"the new Empire\") in 1928, including the Geheimes Deutschland (\"secret Germany\") written in 1922, to Berthold.Stauffenberg was commissioned as a leutnant (second lieutenant) in 1930. He studied modern weapons at the Kriegsakademie in Berlin-Moabit, but remained focused on the use of horses—which continued to carry out a large part of transportation duties throughout World War II—in modern warfare. His regiment became part of the German 1st Light Division under General Erich Hoepner, who had taken part in the plans for the September 1938 German Resistance coup, cut short by Hitler\\'s unexpected diplomatic success in the Munich Agreement. The unit was among the Wehrmacht troops that moved into Sudetenland following its annexation to the Reich as per the Munich Agreement.Although Stauffenberg agreed with the Nazi Party\\'s racist and nationalistic aspects and had supported the German colonization of Poland and made extremist remarks regarding Polish Jews, he never became a member. During the German presidential election, 1932, he voiced support for Hitler:\\n\\nThe idea of the Führer principle [...] bound together with a Volksgemeinschaft, the principle \"The community good before the individual good,\" and the fight against corruption, the fight against the spirit of the large urban cities, the racial thought (Rassengedanke), and the will towards a new German-formed legal order appears to us healthy and auspicious.\\nMoreover, Stauffenberg remained a practicing Catholic. Stauffenberg vacillated between a strong dislike of Hitler\\'s policies and a respect for what he perceived to be Hitler\\'s military acumen. Stauffenberg became even more disassociated with the party after The Night of the Long Knives and Kristallnacht proved Hitler had no intentions to pursue justice. On top of this, the growing systematic ill-treatment of Jews and suppression of religion had offended Stauffenberg\\'s strong sense of Catholic morality and justice.\\n\\nSecond World War\\nActivities in 1939–1940\\nFollowing the outbreak of war in 1939, Stauffenberg and his regiment took part in the attack on Poland. He supported the occupation of Poland and its handling by the Nazi regime and the use of Poles as slave workers to achieve German prosperity as well as German colonization and exploitation of Poland. The deeply rooted belief common in the German aristocracy was that the Eastern territories, populated predominantly by Poles and partly absorbed by Prussia in partitions of Poland, but taken from the German Empire after World War I, should be colonized as the Teutonic Knights had done in the Middle Ages. Stauffenberg said, \"It is essential that we begin a systemic colonization in Poland. But I have no fear that this will not occur\".While his uncle, Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, together with Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg, had approached him before to join the resistance movement against the Hitler regime, it was only after the Polish campaign that Stauffenberg began to consider it. Peter Yorck von Wartenburg and Ulrich Schwerin von Schwanenfeld urged him to become the adjutant of Walther von Brauchitsch, then Supreme Commander of the Army, in order to participate in a coup against Hitler. Stauffenberg declined at the time, reasoning that all German soldiers had pledged allegiance not to the institution of the presidency of the German Reich, but to the person of Adolf Hitler, due to the Führereid introduced in 1934.Stauffenberg\\'s unit was reorganized into the 6th Panzer Division, and he served as an officer on its General Staff in the Battle of France, for which he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class.\\n\\nOperation Barbarossa, 1941\\nOperation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941. Oberkommando des Heeres (\"Army High Command\"; OKH) directed operations on the Eastern Front. Stauffenberg had been transferred to the organizational department of OKH during the idle months of the so-called Phoney War (1939–1940, before the Battle of France). Stauffenberg did not engage in any coup plotting at this time. However, the Stauffenberg brothers (Berthold and Claus) maintained contact with anti-regime figures such as the Kreisau Circle and former commanders like Hoepner. They also included civilians, even social democrats like Julius Leber, in their scenarios for an administration after Hitler.According to Hoffman, citing Brigadier Oskar Alfred-Berger\\'s letters, Stauffenberg had commented openly on the ill-treatment of the Jews when he \"expressed outrage and shock on this subject to fellow officers in the General Staff Headquarters in Vinnitsa (Ukraine) during the summer of 1942.\" Stauffenberg\\'s friend, Major Joachim Kuhn, was captured by the Red Army. During interrogation on 2 September 1944, Kuhn claimed that Stauffenberg had told him in August 1942 that \"They are shooting Jews in masses. These crimes must not be allowed to continue.\"\\n\\nTunisia, 1942\\nIn November 1942, the Allies landed in French North Africa, and the 10th Panzer Division occupied Vichy France (Case Anton) before being transferred to fight in the Tunisia Campaign, as part of the Afrika Korps. In 1943, Stauffenberg was promoted to Oberstleutnant i.G. (lieutenant-colonel of the general staff), and was sent to Africa to join the 10th Panzer Division as its Operations Officer in the General Staff (Ia). On 19 February, Rommel launched his counter-offensive against British, American and French forces in Tunisia. The Axis commanders hoped to break rapidly through either the Sbiba or Kasserine Pass into the rear of the British 1st Army. The assault at Sbiba was halted, so Rommel concentrated on Kasserine Pass where primarily the Italian 7th Bersaglieri Regiment and 131st Armoured Division Centauro had defeated the American defenders. During the fighting, Stauffenberg drove up to be with the leading tanks and troops of the 10th Panzer Division. The division, together with the 21st Panzer Division, took up defensive positions near Mezzouna on 8 April.On 7 April 1943, Stauffenberg was involved in driving from one unit to another, directing their movement. Near Mezzouna, his vehicle was part of a column strafed by Kittyhawk (P-40) fighter bombers of the Desert Air Force – most likely from No. 3 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force  – and he received multiple severe wounds. Stauffenberg spent three months in a hospital in Munich, where he was treated by Ferdinand Sauerbruch. Stauffenberg lost his left eye, his right hand, and two fingers on his left hand. He jokingly remarked to friends never to have really known what to do with so many fingers when he still had all of them. For his injuries, Stauffenberg was awarded the Wound Badge in Gold on 14 April and for his courage the German Cross in Gold on 8 May.\\n\\nIn the resistance, 1943–44\\nFor rehabilitation, Stauffenberg was sent to his home, Schloss Lautlingen (today a museum), then still one of the Stauffenberg castles in southern Germany. The Torfels near Meßstetten Bueloch had been visited many times. Initially, he felt frustrated not to be in a position to stage a coup himself. But by the beginning of September 1943, after a somewhat slow recovery from his wounds, he was propositioned by the conspirators and was introduced to Henning von Tresckow as a staff officer to the headquarters of the Ersatzheer (\"Replacement Army\" – charged with training soldiers to reinforce first line divisions at the front), located on the Bendlerstrasse (later Stauffenbergstrasse) in Berlin.There, one of Stauffenberg\\'s superiors was General Friedrich Olbricht, a committed member of the resistance movement. The Ersatzheer had a unique opportunity to launch a coup, as one of its functions was to have Operation Valkyrie in place. This was a contingency measure to let it assume control of the Reich in the event that internal disturbances blocked communications to the military high command. The Valkyrie plan had been agreed to by Hitler but was secretly changed to sweep the rest of his regime from power in the event of his death. In 1943, Henning von Tresckow was deployed on the Eastern Front, giving Stauffenberg control of the resistance. Tresckow did not return to Germany, as he committed suicide at Królowy Most, Poland in 1944, after learning of the plot\\'s failure.A detailed military plan was developed not only to occupy Berlin, but also to take the different headquarters of the German army and of Hitler in East Prussia by military force after the suicide assassination attempt by Axel von dem Bussche in late November 1943. Stauffenberg had von dem Bussche transmit these written orders personally to Major Kuhn once he had arrived at Wolfsschanze (Wolf\\'s Lair) near Rastenburg, East Prussia. However, von dem Bussche had left the Wolfsschanze for the eastern front, after the meeting with Hitler was cancelled, and the attempt could not be made.Kuhn became a prisoner of war of the Soviets after the 20 July plot. He led the Soviets to the hiding place of the documents in February 1945. In 1989, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev presented these documents to then-German chancellor Dr. Helmut Kohl. The conspirators\\' motivations have been a matter of discussion for years in Germany since the war. Many thought the plotters wanted to kill Hitler in order to end the war and to avoid the loss of their privileges as professional officers and members of the nobility.On D-Day, 6 June 1944, the Allies had landed in France. Stauffenberg, like most other German professional military officers, had absolutely no doubt that the war was lost. Only an immediate armistice could avoid more unnecessary bloodshed and further damage to Germany, its people, and other European nations. However, in late 1943, he had written out demands with which he felt the Allies had to comply in order for Germany to agree to an immediate peace. These demands included Germany retaining its 1914 eastern borders, including the Polish territories of Wielkopolska and Poznań. Other demands included keeping such territorial gains as Austria and the Sudetenland within the Reich, giving autonomy to Alsace-Lorraine, and even expansion of the current wartime borders of Germany in the south by annexing Tyrol as far as Bozen and Meran. Non-territorial demands included such points as refusal of any occupation of Germany by the Allies, as well as refusal to hand over war criminals by demanding the right of \"nations to deal with its own criminals\". These proposals were only directed to the Western Allies – Stauffenberg wanted Germany only to retreat from western, southern and northern positions, while demanding the right to continue military occupation of German territorial gains in the east.\\n\\n20 July plot\\nAs early as September 1942 Stauffenberg was considering Hans Georg Schmidt von Altenstadt, author of Unser Weg zum Meer, as a replacement for Hitler.\\nFrom the beginning of September 1943 until 20 July 1944, Stauffenberg was the driving force behind the plot to assassinate Hitler and take control of Germany. His resolve, organisational abilities, and radical approach put an end to inactivity caused by doubts and long discussions on whether military virtues had been made obsolete by Hitler\\'s behaviour. With the help of his friend Henning von Tresckow, he united the conspirators and drove them into action.Stauffenberg was aware that, under German law, he was committing high treason. He openly told young conspirator Axel von dem Bussche in late 1943, \"ich betreibe mit allen mir zur Verfügung stehenden Mitteln den Hochverrat...\" (\"I am committing high treason with all means at my disposal....\"). He justified himself to Bussche by referring to the right under natural law (Naturrecht) to defend millions of people\\'s lives from the criminal aggressions of Hitler.Only after the conspirator General Helmuth Stieff on 7 July 1944 had declared himself unable to assassinate Hitler on a uniforms display at Klessheim castle near Salzburg, Stauffenberg decided to personally kill Hitler and to run the plot in Berlin. By then, Stauffenberg had great doubts about the possibility of success. Tresckow convinced him to go on with it even if it had no chance of success at all, \"The assassination must be attempted. Even if it fails, we must take action in Berlin\", as this was the only way to prove to the world that the Hitler regime and Germany were not one and the same and that not all Germans supported the regime.Stauffenberg\\'s part in the original plan required him to stay at the Bendlerstraße offices in Berlin, so he could phone regular army units all over Europe in an attempt to convince them to arrest leaders of Nazi political organisations such as the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and the Gestapo. Unfortunately, when General Helmuth Stieff, Chief of Operation at Army High Command, who had regular access to Hitler, backtracked from his earlier commitment to assassinate Hitler, Stauffenberg was forced to take on two critical roles: kill Hitler far from Berlin and trigger the military machine in Berlin during office hours of the very same day. Beside Stieff, he was the only conspirator who had regular access to Hitler (during his briefings) by mid-1944, as well as being the only officer among the conspirators thought to have the resolve and persuasiveness to convince German military leaders to throw in with the coup once Hitler was dead. This requirement greatly reduced the chance of a successful coup.\\n\\nAssassination attempt\\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts by Stauffenberg to encounter Hitler, Göring and Himmler at the same time, he went ahead with the attempt at Wolfsschanze on 20 July 1944. Stauffenberg entered the briefing room carrying a briefcase containing two small bombs. The location had unexpectedly been changed from the subterranean Führerbunker to Albert Speer\\'s wooden hut due to the heat on this summer\\'s day. He left the room to arm the first bomb with specially adapted pliers. This was a difficult task for him as he had lost his right hand and had only three fingers on his left hand. A guard knocked and opened the door, urging him to hurry as the meeting was about to begin. As a result, Stauffenberg was able to arm only one of the bombs. He left the second bomb with his aide-de-camp, Werner von Haeften, and returned to the briefing room, where he placed the briefcase under the conference table, as close as he could to Hitler. Some minutes later, he excused himself and left the room. After his exit, the briefcase was moved by Colonel Heinz Brandt.When the explosion tore through the hut, Stauffenberg was convinced that no one in the room could have survived. Although four people were killed and almost all survivors were injured, Hitler himself was shielded from the blast by the heavy, solid-oak conference table leg, which Colonel Brandt had placed the briefcase bomb behind, and was only slightly wounded.Stauffenberg and Haeften quickly left and drove to the nearby airfield. After his return to Berlin, Stauffenberg immediately began to motivate his friends to initiate the second phase: the military coup against the Nazi leaders. When Joseph Goebbels announced by radio that Hitler had survived and later, after Hitler spoke on the state radio, the conspirators realised that the coup had failed. They were tracked to their Bendlerstrasse offices and overpowered after a brief shoot-out, during which Stauffenberg was wounded in the shoulder.\\n\\nExecution\\nIn an attempt to save his own life, co-conspirator General Friedrich Fromm, Commander-in-Chief of the Replacement Army present in the Bendlerblock (Headquarters of the Army), charged other conspirators in an impromptu court martial and condemned the ringleaders of the conspiracy to death. Stauffenberg, his aide 1st Lieutenant Werner von Haeften, General Friedrich Olbricht, and Colonel Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim were executed before 1:00 in the morning (21 July 1944) by a makeshift firing squad in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock, which was lit by the headlights of a truck.\\n\\nStauffenberg was third in line to be executed, with Lieutenant von Haeften after. However, when it was Stauffenberg\\'s turn, Lieutenant von Haeften placed himself between the firing squad and Stauffenberg, and received the bullets meant for Stauffenberg. When his turn came, Stauffenberg spoke his last words, \"Es lebe das heilige Deutschland!\" (\"Long live our sacred Germany!\"), or, possibly, \"Es lebe das geheime Deutschland!\" (\"Long live the secret Germany!\"), in reference to Stefan George and the anti-Nazi circle.\\nFromm ordered that the executed officers (his former co-conspirators) receive an immediate burial with military honours in the Alter St.-Matthäus-Kirchhof in Berlin\\'s Schöneberg district. The next day, however, Stauffenberg\\'s body was exhumed by the SS, stripped of his medals and insignia, and cremated.Another central figure in the plot was Stauffenberg\\'s eldest brother, Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg. After his arrest in July 1944, Berthold while being interrogated by the Gestapo, claimed that: \"He and his brother had basically approved of the racial principle of National Socialism, but considered it to be exaggerated and excessive.\" On 10 August 1944, Berthold was tried before Judge-President Roland Freisler in the special \"People\\'s Court\" (Volksgerichtshof). This court was established by Hitler for political offences. Berthold was one of eight conspirators executed by slow strangulation in Plötzensee Prison, Berlin, later that day. Before he was killed, Berthold was strangled and then revived multiple times. The entire execution and multiple resuscitations were filmed for Hitler to view at his leisure. More than 200 were condemned in show trials and executed. Hitler used the 20 July Plot as an excuse to destroy anyone he feared would oppose him. The traditional military salute was replaced with the Nazi salute. Eventually, over 20,000 Germans were killed or sent to concentration camps in the purge.\\n\\nAssessment\\nOne of the few surviving members of the German resistance, Hans Bernd Gisevius portrays Colonel Stauffenberg, whom he met in July 1944, as a man driven by reasons which had little to do with Christian ideals or repugnance of Nazi ideology. In his autobiographical Bis zum bitteren Ende (\"To the Bitter End\"), Gisevius writes:\\n\\nStauffenberg wanted to retain all the totalitarian, militaristic and socialistic elements of National Socialism (p. 504). What he had in mind was the salvation of Germany by military men who could break with corruption and maladministration, provide an orderly military government and inspire the people to make one last great effort. Reduced to a formula, he wanted the nation to remain soldierly and become socialistic (p. 503).\\nStauffenberg was motivated by the impulsive passions of the disillusioned military man whose eyes had been opened by the defeat of German arms (p. 510). Stauffenberg had shifted to the rebel side only after Stalingrad (p. 512).\\n\\nThe difference between Stauffenberg, Helldorf and Schulenburg – all of them counts – was that Helldorf had come to the Nazi Movement as a primitive, I might almost say an unpolitical revolutionary. The other two had been attracted primarily by a political ideology. Therefore, it was possible for Helldorf to throw everything overboard at once: Hitler, the Party, the entire system. Stauffenberg, Schulenberg and their clique wanted to drop no more ballast than was absolutely necessary; then they would paint the ship of state a military gray and set it afloat again (p. 513–514).\\nHistorian Peter Hoffman questions Gisevius\\'s evaluations based on the latter\\'s brief acquaintance with Stauffenberg, misreporting of Stauffenberg\\'s actions, and apparent rivalry with him:\\n\\nGisevius met Stauffenberg for the first time in Berlin on July 12, 1944, eight days before the colonel\\'s last assassination attempt against Hitler. ... In view of Gisevius\\'s own record as a transmitter of historical information for which he had displayed strong personal feelings, and in light of what is known about both Gisevius\\'s alleged sources and Stauffenberg himself, Gisevius\\'s account is at best questionable hearsay.\\nGisevius disliked Stauffenberg. He sensed that this dynamic leader would be an obstacle to his own far-reaching ambitions and intrigues. In his book he mocked Stauffenberg as a presumptuous and ignorant amateur. ... Stauffenberg must have been informed of Gisevius\\'s background and it cannot have inspired his confidence. Gisevius was understandably upset by Stauffenberg\\'s attitude toward him. ... Stauffenberg seemed to regard him merely as an incidental source of background information.\\nBritish historian Richard J. Evans, in his books on the Third Reich, covered various aspects of Stauffenberg\\'s beliefs and philosophy. He wrote an article originally published in Süddeutsche Zeitung, 23 January 2009 entitled \"Why did Stauffenberg plant the bomb?\" which states, \"Was it because Hitler was losing the war? Was it to put an end to the mass murder of the Jews. Or was it to save Germany\\'s honour? The overwhelming support, toleration, or silent acquiescence\" from the people of his country for Hitler, which was also being heavily censored and constantly fed propaganda, meant any action must be swift and successful. Evans writes, \"Had Stauffenberg\\'s bomb succeeded in killing Hitler, it is unlikely that the military coup planned to follow it would have moved the leading conspirators smoothly into power\".However, Karl Heinz Bohrer, a cultural critic, literary scholar, publisher, criticized Evans\\' views in an article originally published in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, 30 January 2010. Although agreeing that Evans is historically correct in much of his writing, Bohrer feels that Evans twists time lines and misrepresents certain aspects. He wrote of Evans, \"In the course of his problematic argument he walks into two traps: 1. by contesting Stauffenberg\\'s \"moral motivation\"; 2. by contesting Stauffenberg\\'s suitability as role model.\" He further writes, \"If then, as Evans notes with initial objectivity, Stauffenberg had a strong moral imperative – whether this stemmed from an aristocratic code of honour, Catholic doctrine or Romantic poetry – then this also underpinned his initial affinity for National Socialism which Stauffenberg misinterpreted as \\'spiritual renewal\\'\".In 1980, the German government established a memorial for the failed anti-Nazi resistance movement in a part of the Bendlerblock, the remainder of which currently houses the Berlin offices of the German Ministry of Defense (whose main offices remain in Bonn). The Bendlerstrasse was renamed the Stauffenbergstrasse, and the Bendlerblock now houses the Memorial to the German Resistance, a permanent exhibition with more than 5,000 photographs and documents showing the various resistance organizations at work during the Hitler era. The courtyard where the officers were shot on 21 July 1944 is now a memorial site, with a plaque commemorating the events and a bronze figure of a young man with his hands symbolically bound which resembles Count von Stauffenberg.\\n\\nFamily\\nStauffenberg married Nina Freiin von Lerchenfeld on 26 September 1933 in Bamberg. They had five children: Berthold; Heimeran; Franz-Ludwig; Valerie; and Konstanze, who was born in Frankfurt on the Oder seven months after Stauffenberg\\'s execution. Stauffenberg lived with his family in Berlin-Wannsee. Berthold, Heimeran, Franz-Ludwig and Valerie, who were not told of their father\\'s deed, were placed in a foster home for the remainder of the war and were forced to use new surnames, as Stauffenberg became considered taboo.Nina died at the age of 92 on 2 April 2006 at Kirchlauter near Bamberg, and was buried there on 8 April. Berthold went on to become a general in West Germany\\'s post-war Bundeswehr. Franz-Ludwig became a member of both the German and European parliaments, representing the Christian Social Union in Bavaria. In 2008, Konstanze von Schulthess-Rechberg wrote a best-selling book about her mother, Nina Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg.\\n\\nHe let things come to him, and then he made up his mind ... one of his characteristics was that he really enjoyed playing the devil\\'s advocate. Conservatives were convinced that he was a ferocious Nazi, and ferocious Nazis were convinced he was an unreconstructed conservative. He was neither.\\n\\nSee also\\nAssassination attempts on Adolf Hitler\\nMelitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg\\n\\nReferences\\nBibliography\\nExternal links\\nTimeline of Stauffenberg\\'s life\\nClaus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg (1934) From German History in Documents and Images a project of the German Historical Institute\\n\"Emerging from the Nazi shadow?\".

He secures his bet by sharing a kiss with Coral in front of Brian. Coral breaks up with Brian. Brian and Doug get into a fight, ending their partnership.\\nThree years later, Brian has taken a job in Jamaica as a bartender at a resort to raise money for his own place. He finds a romantic partner in Jordan Mooney, an aspiring artist and waitress that he meets on the beach. Doug shows up in Jamaica, now married to Kerry, a wealthy woman who openly flirts with other men. Doug bets Brian that he couldn\\'t \"pick up\" a new customer named Bonnie, a wealthy older woman. Brian accepts the challenge and wins Bonnie over. As they go back to Bonnie\\'s room, Jordan sees them. Devastated, she takes a plane back to New York City.\\nThe next morning, Brian regrets sleeping with Bonnie. He goes to find Jordan but learns that she\\'s gone. Doug teases Brian about the situation but Brian decides to upstage Doug by returning to New York with Bonnie. He reluctantly assumes the role of kept-boy and grows annoyed by her lifestyle. They have a blow-up during an art exhibit when Brian gets into a fight with the artist. Brian and Bonnie break up.\\nBrian shows up at the diner where Jordan works. She rejects his flirting but agrees to listen to his apology after work. They talk but Brian keeps saying the wrong things.

At the Grand Opening, Jordan reveals that she is pregnant with twins. Brian offers free drinks to celebrate, much to his Uncle Pat\\'s chagrin.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nScript\\nThe film was based on Heywood Gould\\'s semi-autobiographical novel published in 1984. Gould had worked as a bartender in New York from 1969 to 1981 to support his writing career. Gould said he \"met a lot of interesting people behind the bar and very rarely was it someone who started out wanting to be a bartender. They all had ambitions, some smoldering and some completely forgotten or suppressed.\"Gould says the lead character \"is a composite of a lot of people I met, including myself in those days. I was in my late 30s, and I was drinking pretty good, and I was starting to feel like I was missing the boat. The character in the book is an older guy who has been around and starting to feel that he\\'s pretty washed-up.\"Universal bought the film rights and Gould wrote the script, changing it from his novel. He says the studio put the project in turnaround \"because I wasn\\'t making the character likable enough.\" Disney picked up the project \"and I went through the same process with them. I would fight them at every turn, and there was a huge battle over making the lead younger, which I eventually did.\"Gould later admitted that the people who wanted him to make changes \"were correct. They wanted movie characters. Characters who were upbeat and who were going to have a happy ending and a possible future in their lives. That\\'s what you want for a big commercial Hollywood movie. So I tried to walk that thin line between giving them what they wanted and not completely betraying the whole arena of saloons in general.\"Tom Cruise expressed interest in playing the role, which helped get it financed.\\n\"There were a lot of bartenders around like Tom Cruise, younger guys who came on and were doing this for a while—and then 10 years later, still doing it,\" said Gould. \"It wasn\\'t as if I was betraying the character. It was a matter of making the character more idealistic, more hopeful—he\\'s got his life ahead of him. He turns on the charm, without the cynical bitter edge of the older guys.\"Bryan Brown later said the original script \"was one of the very best screenplays I had ever read. Very dark... about the cult of celebrity and everything about it.... Tom Cruise is a very sweet man, he was then and still is. But when Tom came in, the movie had to change. The studio made the changes to protect the star and it became a much slighter movie because of it.\"\\n\\nCasting\\nBryan Brown was cast on the strength of his performance in F/X.\\n\\nProduction\\nGould says the tricks involving throwing bottles was not in the book, but something he showed Cruise and Bryan Brown. They used it and it became a prominent feature of the film.\\n\\nPost production\\nA music score was originally done by Maurice Jarre. A new score was added at the last minute.Kelly Lynch later said the film \"was actually a really complicated story about the ’80s and power and money, and it was really re-edited where they completely lost my character\\'s backstory—her low self-esteem, who her father was, why she was this person that she was—but it was obviously a really successful movie, if not as good as it could’ve been.\" She claimed Disney reshot \"about a third of the film... and turned it into flipping the bottles and this and that.... But we had a really great time. And Tom was so much fun, just a ball to work with, both on and off camera.\"\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nCocktail earned $78.2 million at the North American box office, and $93.3 million globally to a total of $171.5 million worldwide, almost nine times its $20 million budget, and ranking as the eighth highest-grossing film of 1988 worldwide.\\n\\nCritical response\\nDespite its box office success, the film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 7% of 44 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 3.94/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"There are no surprises in Cocktail, a shallow, dramatically inert romance that squanders Tom Cruise\\'s talents in what amounts to a naive barkeep\\'s banal fantasy.\" On Metacritic, the film has a 12 out of 100 score based on 14 reviews, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.Vincent Canby of The New York Times gave a negative review, calling it \"an upscale, utterly brainless variation on those efficient old B-movies of the 1930s and 40s about the lives, loves and skills of coal miners, sand hogs, and telephone linemen, among others.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was also critical, explaining that \"the more you think about what really happens in Cocktail, the more you realize how empty and fabricated it really is.\"\"I was not happy with the final product,\" said Gould. \"It got so savaged by the critics ... I was accused of betraying my own work, which is stupid. So I was pretty devastated. I literally couldn\\'t get out of bed for a day. The good thing about that experience is that it toughened me up.\"In 1992, Cruise said the film \"was not a crowning jewel\" in his career.However, the official soundtrack single, The Beach Boys\\' \"Kokomo\", was commercially successful and topped the charts in America, Australia and Japan. The song was nominated for a Grammy and a Golden Globe.\\n\\nAccolades\\nCocktail won two Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay while Cruise was nominated as Worst Actor and Donaldson as Worst Director. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson\\'s book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of \"The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made\". The film was also nominated for Worst Picture at the 1988 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards but lost to Caddyshack II.Additionally, Cruise\\'s other film in 1988 was his co-starring role in the Best Picture-winning film Rain Man, alongside Dustin Hoffman. In doing so, he became the first (and as of 2020, only) actor to star in a Worst Picture Razzie winner and Best Picture Oscar winner in the same year. The film has gone on to attain cult film status.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nChart positions\\nWeeklyYear-end\\n\\nCertifications\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nCocktail at IMDb\\nCocktail at the TCM Movie Database\\nCocktail at Box Office Mojo\\nCocktail at Rotten Tomatoes\\nCocktail at Metacritic',\n",
              " 'Collateral (film)': 'Collateral is a 2004 American neo-noir action thriller film directed and produced by Michael Mann from a script by Stuart Beattie and starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. The supporting cast includes Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Javier Bardem, and Bruce McGill. It follows Max, a Los Angeles cab driver and his customer Vincent. When offered a high fare for driving to several locations, Max agrees but soon finds himself taken hostage by Vincent who turns out to be a hitman on a contract killing spree.\\nScreenwriter Beattie first conceived the idea for the film when taking a taxicab home from Sydney airport. Beattie shared the idea with producer Julie Richardson, who showed it to director Frank Darabont. The film was pitched to HBO but was declined. It was purchased by DreamWorks but would not see development for three years. Before the trio of Mann, Cruise and Foxx joined the film, Mimi Leder, Janusz Kamiński and Fernando Meirelles were each considered as director, and Russell Crowe and Adam Sandler were in talks to star as Vincent and Max, respectively. Filming primarily took place throughout Los Angeles, and was the first feature film to be shot with a Viper FilmStream High-Definition Camera. The musical score was composed by James Newton Howard, with additional songs from Audioslave and Paul Oakenfold.\\nCollateral was released in the United States on August 6, 2004, and grossed $217 million worldwide. The film received critical acclaim in particular for the performances of Cruise and Foxx, Mann\\'s direction and the editing, although the pacing and second half of the film received a mixed reception. Collateral was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2004. At the 77th Academy Awards, Foxx received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor; while film editors Jim Miller and Paul Rubell were nominated for Best Film Editing.\\n\\nPlot\\nMax is a meticulous Los Angeles cab driver trying to earn enough to start his own limousine business. One of the evening\\'s fares is federal prosecutor Annie Farrell, who works for the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California. On the drive to her office, they strike up a conversation and Annie gives Max her business card.\\nMax\\'s next fare is Vincent. Apparently impressed by Max\\'s skill at navigating through traffic, Vincent tells Max that he is in Los Angeles for one night to complete a real estate deal, and offers Max $600 to drive him to several locations. Initially reluctant to violate regulations, Max is eventually persuaded. As Max waits at the first stop, a corpse falls onto his car; Vincent reveals himself as a hitman and the body is one of his five targets. He forces Max to hide the body in the trunk and continue driving.\\nAt the second stop, Vincent restrains Max\\'s hands to the steering wheel. Max asks a group of young men for help, but two of them rob him and seize Vincent\\'s briefcase; seeing the men walk away with the briefcase, Vincent deftly shoots them both dead and retrieves the briefcase. He then offers to buy Max a drink at a jazz club. At the club, Vincent engages the owner Daniel in conversation. Vincent then reveals Daniel to have been his third target. Max pleads with Vincent to let Daniel go, causing Vincent to offer a compromise, betting Daniel cannot answer a question about where Miles Davis \"learned music\". Daniel states that Davis went to the Juilliard School, seemingly giving a correct answer. Vincent, suddenly, unexpectedly shoots Daniel, revealing that Miles Davis dropped out of Juilliard to be mentored by Charlie Parker.\\nMax\\'s boss Lenny, who has been hectoring him over the radio, tells Max his mother Ida called. Learning of Max\\'s nightly visits to the hospital to see his mother, Vincent insists that Max proceed with the visit. At the hospital, Ida proudly tells Vincent that Max has his own limousine company, revealing Max has been lying to her.\\nOverwhelmed, Max leaves, stealing Vincent\\'s briefcase, and hurls it onto a freeway where it is destroyed by a passing truck. With the information on his last two targets destroyed, Vincent coerces Max to meet drug lord Felix Reyes-Torrena to re-obtain the information. Max, posing as Vincent, acquires the information but Felix orders his men to kill \"Vincent\" if he does not complete the job.\\nMax heads with Vincent to a nightclub, seeking the next target, Peter Lim. Narcotics detective Ray Fanning uncovers a connection between the three victims and reports his finding to FBI agent Frank Pedrosa. Pedrosa identifies the victims as witnesses in a federal grand jury indicting Reyes-Torrena the following day. At the nightclub, Vincent kills Felix\\'s hitmen, Lim, and his bodyguards. Fanning rescues Max and smuggles him outside, but Vincent fatally shoots him and coerces Max back into the cab.\\nFollowing their getaway, the two trade insulting summaries of each other\\'s personalities and choices in life. After a heated exchange, Max deliberately crashes the cab, but both survive, and Vincent escapes. A police officer arrives. Seeing the corpse in the trunk, he tries to arrest Max. However, Max notices Vincent\\'s open laptop, revealing that his final target is Annie. He overpowers the police officer, takes his gun, and rushes toward Annie\\'s office building.\\nStealing a bystander\\'s phone, Max uses Annie\\'s business card to call and warn her. She is incredulous until Max reveals details about Vincent\\'s previous victims, urging her to call 911. Vincent steals the security guard\\'s gun and uses a fire axe to cut the power and telephone lines on Annie\\'s floor. Vincent finds Annie but is shot and wounded by Max, who escapes with Annie on foot. Vincent pursues the pair onto a metro rail train. Cornered on the train, Max engages Vincent in a sudden shootout; both men empty their handguns at each other. Vincent, fatally wounded, slumps into a seat, repeating a story about a man dying unnoticed on a Metro train. Max and Annie get off at the next station in the dawn of a new day.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nWhen he was 17 years old, Australian writer Stuart Beattie took a cab home from Sydney airport and had the idea of a homicidal maniac sitting in the back of a cab with the driver nonchalantly conversing with him, trusting his passenger implicitly. Beattie drafted his idea into a two-page treatment titled \"The Last Domino\", then later began writing the screenplay. The original story centered around an African-American female cop who witnesses a hit, and the romance between the cab driver and his then librarian girlfriend. The final film has limited resemblance to the original treatment. Beattie was waiting tables when he came in to contact with Julie Richardson, whom he had met on a UCLA Screenwriting Extension course. Richardson had become a producer and was searching for projects for Frank Darabont, Rob Fried and Chuck Russell\\'s company, Edge City, which was created to make low budget genre movies for HBO. Beattie later pitched her his idea of \"The Last Domino.\" Richardson pitched the idea to Darabont, who brought the team in for a meeting, including Beattie, and set up the project under Edge City. After two drafts, HBO passed on the project. At a general meeting at DreamWorks with executive Marc Haimes, Beattie mentioned the script. Haimes immediately contacted Richardson, read the script overnight, and DreamWorks put in an offer the following day. Early drafts of Collateral\\'s script set the film in New York City. However, later revisions of the script moved the film\\'s setting to Los Angeles. Darabont, Fried and Russell would remain on as executive producers.\\n\\nPre-production\\nMimi Leder and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński were attached to the project at one point as the director. Upon Russell Crowe expressing interest in playing the role of Vincent, development on the film moved forward. Crowe got his The Insider director Michael Mann involved, but after constant delays, Crowe departed the project. Mann then approached Tom Cruise with the idea of him playing Vincent and Adam Sandler in the role of Max. Sandler later dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with Spanglish and was replaced by Jamie Foxx. Beattie wanted the studio to cast Robert De Niro as Max (once again making him a taxi driver, though the exact opposite of Travis Bickle). However, the studio refused, insisting on a younger actor for the role. Cuba Gooding Jr. revealed in a 2018 interview he had turned down a part in the film due to concerns he would be miscast. Mann\\'s reasons for casting Foxx, with whom he worked with on Ali, was that he held a similar quality in his performances to Cruise. \"I saw that [quality of Tom’s] in Jamie on In Living Color — his characters were so vivid. That’s why I went after him for [cornerman] Bundini Brown in Ali. Jamie starts with mimicry, but then he talks about ”putting it into the database,” so he can access a character once he\\'s got it down\". Prior to Mann taking on the directing position, Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles had initially agreed to direct, but eventually decided to exit as the production would require him to relocate to Los Angeles for eight months. Meirelles described his vision for the film as being that of a comedy, and looked at telling it in a way similar to Martin Scorsese\\'s After Hours. To prepare for his role, Cruise worked covertly as a FedEx deliveryman. Mann stated the goal was for Cruise to not be recognized.Jada Pinkett Smith, cast in the role of Annie, spent time with an attorney to inform her performance. Val Kilmer was originally cast in the film as Detective Fanning, but exited to star in Oliver Stone\\'s Alexander, resulting in Mark Ruffalo taking on the role instead. In a similar situation, Dennis Farina, initially cast as Agent Pedrosa, had to exit due to scheduling conflicts with the television series Law & Order, and was recast with Bruce McGill. Javier Bardem was cast in what was described as \"a small role\" at the time. Jason Statham made a small appearance in a role credited as \"Airport Man\". Louis Leterrier, co-director of the 2002 action film The Transporter revealed that Statham was portraying his Transporter character Frank Martin in his scene.\\n\\nFilming\\nAfter three weeks of filming, cinematographer Paul Cameron left the project due to creative differences with Mann. Dion Beebe was brought on to replace Cameron. Mann chose to use the Viper FilmStream High-Definition Camera to film many of Collateral\\'s scenes, the first such use in a major motion picture. Mann had previously used the format for portions of Ali and his CBS drama Robbery Homicide Division and would later employ the same camera for the filming of Miami Vice. The sequence in the nightclub was shot in 35 mm.Filming took place throughout Los Angeles, with Los Angeles International Airport and Koreatown used for setpieces, and filming was also done in Pico Rivera, California. For filming of the cab crash scene, it was Foxx driving the vehicle, with Cruise in the backseat.\\n\\nMusic\\nJames Newton Howard composed the score for the film, with additional music by Antônio Pinto. The Collateral soundtrack was released on August 3, 2004, by Hip-O Records. Howard estimated that only half of the music he composed was used in the final cut of the film.\\nTrack listing\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nThe film opened on August 6, 2004, in 3,188 theaters in the United States and Canada and grossed approximately $24.7 million on its opening weekend, ranking number one at the box office. It remained in theaters for 14 weeks and eventually grossed $101,005,703 in the U.S. and Canada. In other countries, it grossed $116,758,588 for a worldwide $217,764,291.\\n\\nCritical response\\nThe film received positive reviews. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 234 reviews, with an average rating of 7.45/10. The critical consensus states that \"Driven by director Michael Mann\\'s trademark visuals and a lean, villainous performance from Tom Cruise, Collateral is a stylish and compelling noir thriller.\" On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 71 out of 100, based on 41 reviews.Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post praised the film and Cruise\\'s performance. He summarized the film as \"the best kind of genre filmmaking: It plays by the rules, obeys the traditions and is both familiar and fresh at once\". Roger Ebert praised the performances of Cruise and Foxx, with Ebert calling Foxx\\'s work a \"revelation\". In addition to praising the performances of Cruise, Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote of Foxx\\'s performance: \"Foxx can act. He\\'s up to the role\\'s demands, conveying fear, confusion and frustration, but more important the exhaustion and recklessness that can easily follow when someone\\'s been scared for so long\". Desson Thomson gave similar praise to Foxx, finding the actor \"quietly pries the movie from Cruise\\'s big-marquee fingers\". David Ansen of Newsweek praised the film, however he criticized the third act of the film as \"generic and farfetched\". Placing the film on his best of the year list, Richard Schickel of Time magazine praised the acting in addition to Mann\\'s direction and Beattie\\'s screenplay, despite finding logical inconsistencies in the plot and that it \"does not have quite enough completely compelling incidents to sustain its considerable length\".In a mixed review, Marrit Ingman of the Austin Chronicle gave positive remarks to Mann\\'s film-making, but stated \"There’s not much substance lurking beneath all the style, though the plot digresses into several awkward scenes intended to flesh out the characters\". David Edelstein of Slate magazine highlighted Foxx\\'s performance as \"terrific\" and was favorable to the film\\'s first act, but derided the rest of the film. \"It’s too bad that halfway through, Collateral turns into a series of loud, chaotic, over-the-top action set pieces in which the existentialist Mann proves he’s lousy at action\". Edelstein also criticized the performance of Cruise, referring to his performance as \"robotic\". Stephanie Zacharek of Salon magazine criticized Cruise\\'s performance, finding that \"Cruise\\'s dignity rings stiff and false\". Zacharek did praise the performance of Foxx, stating \"Foxx inhabits his character so comfortably that he renders meaningless Vincent\\'s babble about the tough, real world. Max is the one who lives in the real world, which is ultimately the point of the movie -- but it takes the picture a very long time to reach a conclusion that\\'s evident from the start to any attuned viewer\".Richard Roeper placed Collateral as his 10th favorite film of 2004. The film was voted as the 9th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with two criteria: \"The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list\".\\n\\nAwards\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nCollateral at IMDb\\nCollateral at AllMovie\\nCollateral at Rotten Tomatoes\\nCollateral at Metacritic\\nCollateral at Box Office Mojo',\n",

              " 'Days of Thunder': 'Days of Thunder  is a 1990 American sports action drama film released by Paramount Pictures, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Tony Scott. The cast includes Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Robert Duvall, Randy Quaid, Cary Elwes, Caroline Williams, and Michael Rooker. The film also features appearances by real life NASCAR racers, such as Rusty Wallace, Neil Bonnett, and Harry Gant. Commentator Dr. Jerry Punch, of ESPN, has a cameo appearance, as does co-producer Don Simpson.\\nThis is the first of three films to star both Cruise and Kidman (the other two being Far and Away and Eyes Wide Shut). The film received mixed reviews, with criticism aimed at its unrealistic special effects, characters, screenplay, acting, dialogue and similarities to Top Gun, but was widely praised for its action sequences, Hans Zimmer\\'s musical score, fast pace, and the performances of Cruise and Kidman.\\n\\nPlot\\nCole Trickle is a young racer from Eagle Rock, California, with years of experience in open-wheel racing, winning championships with the World of Outlaws. Originally setting his sights on the Indianapolis 500, Cole realizes that \"To win in Indy I\\'d need a great car, but stock cars are all the same\". He is recruited by Chevrolet dealership tycoon Tim Daland to race for his team in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series. Daland brings former crew chief and car builder Harry Hogge out of retirement to lead Cole\\'s pit crew (Harry had left NASCAR a year prior to avoid investigation involving the death of driver Buddy Bretherton). After Cole sets a fast time in a private test at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Hogge builds him a new Chevrolet Lumina.\\nIn his first few races, Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew, while being intimidated on the track by Winston Cup Champion and dirty driver Rowdy Burns; these obstacles, combined with crashes and blown engines, prevent Cole from finishing the races. Discovering that Cole does not understand common NASCAR terminology, Harry puts him through rigorous training. This pays off at Darlington, when Cole uses a slingshot maneuver from the outside line to overtake Rowdy and win his first race.\\nThe rivalry between Cole and Rowdy intensifies throughout the season until the Firecracker 400 at Daytona, where both drivers are seriously injured after being caught in \"The Big One\". Recovering in Daytona Beach, Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr. Claire Lewicki, a neurosurgeon at a local hospital. NASCAR President Big John brings Rowdy and Cole together in a meeting and warns them that he and his sport will no longer tolerate any misbehaviour from the two rivals. Persuaded by Big John, Cole and Rowdy have dinner and settle their differences by smashing rental cars in a race on the beach. The bitter rivals soon become close friends.\\nDaland hires hot-shot rookie Russ Wheeler to fill Cole\\'s seat until Cole returns, and then expands his team, with Daland now fielding two teams – the second car driven by Wheeler, of which Harry disapproves. Though Cole shows signs of his old self, he falls into a new rivalry with Russ with no help from the inexperienced Daland, who is defensive of his new driver. At North Wilkesboro, Russ blocks Cole\\'s path during their pit stop, and later forces Cole into the outside wall on the last lap to win the race. In retaliation, Cole crashes into Russ’ car after the race, leading to a fight between Harry, Daland, and both of Cole and Russ\\'s pit crews, with Daland firing both Cole and Harry in the process.\\nRowdy learns he has to undergo brain surgery to fix a broken blood vessel, and asks Cole to drive his car at the Daytona 500 so his sponsors will pay for the year. Cole reluctantly agrees and convinces Harry to return as his crew chief. Hours prior to the race, Harry discovers metal in the oil pan, a sign of engine failure, and manages to procure a new engine from Daland, who still believes in his former driver\\'s promise. During the race, Cole\\'s car is spun out by Russ and suffers a malfunctioning transmission, but the combined efforts of Harry\\'s and Daland\\'s pit crews manage to fix the problem and get Cole back on the lead lap. On the final lap, Russ predicts that Cole will attempt his signature slingshot maneuver from outside, but Cole tricks him with a crossover, overtaking him from the inside to win his first Daytona 500.\\nCole drives into Victory Lane, where he and his pit crew celebrate with Claire. He approaches Harry, sitting alone, but Harry is at a loss for words. Cole asks Harry to walk with him and Harry agrees, challenging him to a foot race to Victory Lane.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Cole Trickle, a young race car driver out to make a name for himself in NASCAR. He drives the No. 46 City Chevrolet, the SuperFlo Chevrolet and later the No. 51 Mello Yello Chevrolet. The character was patterned after Tim Richmond, while his name is a nod to veteran racer Dick Trickle.\\nRobert Duvall as Harry Hogge, Cole\\'s crew chief (patterned after Harry Hyde).\\nNicole Kidman as Dr. Claire Lewicki, a neurosurgeon who develops a relationship with Cole.\\nMichael Rooker as Rowdy Burns, the current Winston Cup Champion and Cole\\'s first rival and friend.

He drives the No. 18 Hardee\\'s Chevrolet (patterned after Rusty Wallace).\\nRandy Quaid as Tim Daland, a wealthy car dealership and race team owner who first recruits Cole into NASCAR (patterned after Rick Hendrick).\\nFred Dalton Thompson as Big John, president of NASCAR (patterned after \"Big Bill\" France).\\nJohn C. Reilly as Buck Bretherton, Cole\\'s car chief. Reilly also starred in Talladega Nights.\\nJ. C. Quinn as Waddell, Rowdy\\'s crew chief. The name is likely a reference to Waddell Wilson.\\nCaroline Williams as Jeannie Burns, Rowdy\\'s wife.\\nLeilani Sarelle as a Female Highway Patrol Officer who is actually a stripper hired by Harry as a prank on Cole.\\nChris Ellis as Harlem Hoogerhyde, Cole\\'s gas man (patterned after Danny \"Chocolate\" Myers).\\nMargo Martindale in her first acting role as Harry\\'s timekeeper.\\nDon Simpson in a cameo as Aldo Bennedetti (patterned after Mario Andretti and using his twin brother Aldo Andretti\\'s first name). He drives the No. 34 Goody\\'s Powder Chevrolet.Richard Petty, Rusty Wallace, Neil Bonnett, Harry Gant, and Dr. Jerry Punch all appear in cameo roles as themselves. Bob Jenkins had a voice-over role as public address announcer.\\n\\nProduction\\nPrincipal photography took place in early 1990 in and around Charlotte and Daytona Beach. It was plagued with delays due to frequent arguments on set between Simpson and Bruckheimer, Scott, and sometimes Towne over how to set up a shot. Crew members sat idle for long hours; some later said they had accumulated enough overtime pay to go on vacation for a full four months after filming was completed. The completion date was pushed back many times, with filming being completed in early May, three months later than it had originally been scheduled. At one point, following the third revision of the shooting schedule in a single day, the unit production manager, who represents the studio on the set or location, confronted Simpson and Bruckheimer and was told bluntly that the schedule no longer mattered.In Daytona, Simpson and Bruckheimer spent $400,000 to have a vacant storefront in their hotel converted into their private gym, with a large neon sign reading \"Days of Thunder.\" Simpson also kept a closet full of Donna Karan dresses to offer the attractive women his assistants found on the beach, and held private parties with friends like rapper Tone Lōc. Towne also played a role in the film\\'s increasing cost by scrapping more barn scenes when he didn\\'t like either of two barns built to his specifications. The film\\'s original budget of $35 million nearly doubled; at that level it would have had to make at least $100 million, a rare gross at that time, to break even. In addition, when Tom Cruise failed to win the Oscar for Born on the Fourth of July, some additional budget was cut. Despite the budget overruns and delays, reportedly it was only after shooting was finished that the filmmakers discovered they had neglected to film Cole Trickle\\'s car crossing the finish line at Daytona. Nine million dollars of the film\\'s budget plus gross percentage went to star Tom Cruise.\\n\\nRace cars\\nThe cars used as those of Cole Trickle, Rowdy Burns, and Russ Wheeler were provided by Hendrick Motorsports, with racers Greg Sacks, Tommy Ellis, Bobby Hamilton, and Hut Stricklin as the stand-in drivers. In order to provide authentic race footage involving the cars, these cars were actually raced on three occasions. In late 1989, Hamilton and Sacks raced at Phoenix. Hamilton officially qualified fifth and led a lap before his engine blew. In 1990, the cars were raced again at Daytona and Darlington. Sacks drove a car during the Busch Clash, while Hamilton and Ellis drove unscored entries in the Daytona 500. At Darlington, Stricklin and Sacks drove two of the cars, but both were pulled from the race early after Sacks broke a crankshaft. Cole\\'s first car in the film is sponsored by City Chevrolet, a real-life car dealership in Charlotte, North Carolina, owned by Rick Hendrick.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe score for Days of Thunder was composed by Hans Zimmer, with Jeff Beck making a guest appearance on guitar. This was the first of an ongoing list of films in which Zimmer would compose the score for a Jerry Bruckheimer production. An official score album was not released until 2013, by La-La Land Records. The film\\'s theme song \"Last Note of Freedom\" was sung by David Coverdale of the band Whitesnake at the request of Tom Cruise himself. Coverdale\\'s vocal parts were recorded in 1990 in Los Angeles during a day off of the Whitesnake Slip of the Tongue Liquor and Poker world tour. \"Show Me Heaven\", written and sung by Maria McKee, reached number one in the music charts of the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway.\\n\\nRelease and reception\\nDays of Thunder was released on Wednesday, June 27, 1990. The film was a financial success grossing $157,920,733. The film was also successful on home video. It grossed $40 million in rentals. It holds a rating of 38% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 65 reviews. The site\\'s consensus states: \"Days of Thunder has Tom Cruise and plenty of flash going for it, but they aren\\'t enough to compensate for the stock plot, two-dimensional characters, and poorly written dialogue.\" The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound (Charles M. Wilborn, Donald O. Mitchell, Rick Kline and Kevin O\\'Connell). It received mixed reviews from critics who mostly shrugged off the sometimes over-the-top special effects and plot which in many ways resembled the earlier Bruckheimer, Simpson, Scott and Cruise vehicle Top Gun, which had been a huge success four years earlier. Halliwell\\'s Film Guide dismissed Days of Thunder as \"An over familiar story rendered no more interestingly than usual\", while the Monthly Film Bulletin described it as \"simply a flashy, noisy star vehicle for Tom Cruise, one which – like the stock car he drives – goes around in circles getting nowhere\".\\n\\nLegacy\\nFollowing Tony Scott\\'s death in 2012, film critic Stephen Metcalf argued that the film marked an important turning point in the history of the American film industry. \"The best film he made may well have been Crimson Tide,\" he wrote in Slate, \"but the most important film he made was Days of Thunder.\" The excesses of its production and its failure to equal Top Gun\\'s magnitude of box-office success, he argues, helped end the era that had followed the failure of Heaven\\'s Gate ten years earlier. The studio\\'s willingness to indulge director Michael Cimino on that film, as other studios had been doing up to that point, led to a backlash where studios favored producers like Simpson and Bruckheimer whose films bore far more of their imprint than any director who worked for them. Crimson Tide, made several years after Days of Thunder, was the critical and commercial success it was, Metcalf says, because after similar excesses on the producers\\' part like those that occurred on Thunder directors were allowed to reassert themselves.Quentin Tarantino said the film was his favorite big budget racing movie:\\n\\nYeah, yeah, you laugh but seriously I’m a big fan. To me Days of Thunder is the movie Grand Prix and Le Mans should have been. Sure, it had a big budget, big stars and a big director in Tony Scott, but it had the fun of those early AIP movies. I just don\\'t think it works if you take the whole thing too seriously.\\n\\nPopular culture\\nWhile the movie was neither based on a true story, nor a biographical film, the main character Cole Trickle was very loosely based on the careers of Tim Richmond and Geoff Bodine, and several scenes reenacted or referenced real-life stories and personalities from NASCAR history. The scene where Big John tells Cole and Rowdy they will drive to dinner together is based on an actual meeting Bill France Jr. had in the 1980s between Dale Earnhardt Sr. and Geoff Bodine. Richard Childress and Dale Earnhardt Jr. discussed how Days of Thunder was based on the rivalry between Dale Earnhardt Sr. and Geoff Bodine. One scene in which Cole deliberately blows his engine by over-revving it reflects upon an incident in which Tim Richmond was said to have done at Michigan in 1987. In another scene, Trickle is told he cannot pit because the crew is too busy eating ice cream. This incident actually occurred at the 1987 Southern 500 involving the Hendrick Motorsports No. 35 team with crew chief Harry Hyde and Richmond\\'s replacement driver Benny Parsons. The scene where Cole and Rowdy destroy a pair of rental cars by racing them through the city streets loosely referenced early 1950s NASCAR superstars Joe Weatherly and Curtis Turner, each of whom were known to rent cars, race, and crash them with abandon. In the final race at Daytona, Harry tells Cole they had to change engines. When asked where the Engine came from, Harry says \"we stole it\" when in reality it came from his previous owner Tim. In the final race at Atlanta in 1990, the championship race between Mark Martin and Dale Earnhardt was neck and neck. Martin did not feel any of his cars were good enough, so Robert Yates allowed Roush Racing to borrow one of Davey Allison\\'s cars for a test run and the race. Robert Yates wanted a Ford to win the championship, so he did all in his power to help. Dale Earnhardt edged out Mark Martin by 26pts for the Winston Cup.\\nA year after the film\\'s release, the fictional Mello Yello sponsorship depicted on Trickle\\'s No. 51 car was followed by a real-life sponsorship arrangement. The No. 42 Pontiac of SABCO Racing driven by Kyle Petty carried the paint scheme from 1991–1994. Mello Yello also sponsored the fall race at Charlotte from 1990–1994. The 2015 Bojangles\\' Southern 500 at Darlington saw this paint scheme again with the No. 42 Chevy of Kyle Larson piloting the now throwback scheme. The throwback scheme returned to the 2017 Bojangles\\' Southern 500 in the form of Rick Ware Racing\\'s No. 51 Chevy driven by Cody Ware, but with a \"Pray for Texas\" message in support of the survivors of Hurricane Harvey. At the 2013 Subway Firecracker 250, driver Kurt Busch had his unsponsored No. 1 Phoenix Racing Chevy painted to resemble Cole Trickle\\'s No. 46 City Chevrolet car as part of an awareness campaign for the Armed Forces Foundation. The City Chevrolet paint scheme returned on the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports car of William Byron at the 2019 Bojangles\\' Southern 500. In 2015, M&M\\'s released a promo video on YouTube to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Days of Thunder and to promote M&M\\'s Crispy. The video features driver Kyle Busch and crew chief Adam Stevens parodying scenes from the film. For the 2018 Bojangles\\' Southern 500, The No. 51 Chevy of Rick Ware Racing driven by B. J. McLeod sported a paint scheme resembling Russ Wheeler\\'s No. 18 Hardee\\'s car, but with Jacob Companies as the sponsor. The No. 51 Chevy of Jeremy Clements Racing  used a paint scheme resembling Rowdy Burns\\' Exxon car, but with RepairableVehicles.com as the sponsor, at the 2019 Xfinity Darlington race.\\n\\nVideo games\\nIn 1990, Mindscape released a video game adaptation of the film for multiple platforms such as the PC, NES and Amiga. A Game Boy version was released in 1992. The game is currently available for the PlayStation Network and iOS. Paramount Digital Entertainment released a new video game based on the film for the iOS, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable. iOS version was released in 2009 and other versions were released in 2011. The game will include 12 NASCAR sanctioned tracks—including Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway—and the film characters Cole Trickle, Rowdy Burns, and Russ Wheeler. The PS3 version, labeled Days of Thunder: NASCAR Edition will have more than 12 select NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers, including Denny Hamlin, Ryan Newman and Tony Stewart.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nDays of Thunder at IMDb\\nDays of Thunder at AllMovie\\nDays of Thunder at Rotten Tomatoes\\nDays of Thunder at Box Office Mojo\\nDays of Thunder at Metacritic\\nDays of Thunder at the American Film Institute Catalog',\n",

His first theatrical performance was 1961\\'s A Cook for Mr. General as Ridzinski. During that time he appeared in several guest roles on television in shows like Naked City and The Defenders. He then starred in the 1966 off-Broadway play Eh? where his performance garnered him both a Theatre World Award and Drama Desk Award.His breakthrough role was as Benjamin Braddock in Mike Nichols\\' critically acclaimed and iconic film The Graduate (1967), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. His next role was \"Ratso\" Rizzo in John Schlesinger\\'s Midnight Cowboy (1969), in which he acted alongside Jon Voight; they both received Oscar nominations, and the film went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. He gained success in the 1970s playing roles that shaped the craft of his acting, crossing genres effortlessly in the western Little Big Man (1971), the prison drama Papillon (1973), playing a controversial and groundbreaking comedian in Bob Fosse\\'s Lenny (1975), Marathon Man alongside Laurence Olivier (1976), and as Carl Bernstein investigating the Watergate scandal in All the President\\'s Men (1976). In 1979, Hoffman starred in the family drama Kramer vs. Kramer alongside Meryl Streep. They both received Academy Awards for their performances.After a three-year break from films Hoffman returned in Sydney Pollack\\'s showbusiness comedy  Tootsie (1982) about a struggling actor who pretends to be a woman in order to get an acting role. He returned to stage acting with a 1984 performance as Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman and reprised the role a year later in a television film earning a Primetime Emmy Award. In 1987 he starred alongside Warren Beatty in Elaine May\\'s comedy Ishtar He won his second Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the autistic savant Ray Babbitt in the 1988 film Rain Man, co-starring Tom Cruise.  In 1989, he was nominated for a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for playing Shylock in a stage performance of The Merchant of Venice. In the 1990s, he made appearances in such film as Warren Beatty\\'s action comedy adaptation Dick Tracy (1990), Steven Spielberg\\'s Hook (1991) as Captain Hook, medical disaster Outbreak (1995), legal crime drama Sleepers (1996) and the satirical black comedy Wag the Dog (1997) alongside Robert De Niro.\\nIn the 21st century, Hoffman has appeared in films such as Finding Neverland (2004), I Heart Huckabees (2004), Stranger than Fiction (2006), as well as the Meet the Fockers (2004) and Little Fockers (2010). Hoffman has done voice work for The Tale of Despereaux (2008) and the Kung Fu Panda film series (2008-2016). In 2012, he made his directorial debut with Quartet starring Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2017, Hoffman starred in Noah Baumbach\\'s critically acclaimed family drama The Meyerowitz Stories. He is the recipient of numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, six Golden Globe Awards (including the Cecil B. DeMille Award), four British Academy Film Awards, three Drama Desk Awards, and two Emmy Awards. Hoffman received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1999 and the Kennedy Center Honors Award in 2012.\\n\\nEarly life\\nDustin Lee Hoffman was born on August 8, 1937, in Los Angeles, California, the second son of Harry Hoffman (1908–1987) and Lillian (née Gold; 1909–1982). His father worked as a prop supervisor (set decorator) at Columbia Pictures before becoming a furniture salesman.Hoffman was named after stage and silent screen actor Dustin Farnum. His elder brother, Ronald, is a lawyer and economist. Hoffman is Jewish, from an Ashkenazi Jewish family of immigrants from Kyiv, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), and Iași, Romania. The family\\'s surname was spelled Гойхман (Goikhman) in the Russian Empire.His upbringing was nonreligious, and he has said, \"I don\\'t have any memory of celebrating holidays growing up that were Jewish,\" and that he had \"realized\" he was Jewish at around the age of 10.Hoffman graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1955 and enrolled at Santa Monica College with the intention of studying medicine. He left after a year to join the Pasadena Playhouse, although when he told his family about his career goal, his Aunt Pearl warned him, \"You can\\'t be an actor. You are not good-looking enough.\" He also took classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City.\\n\\nCareer\\nEarly work\\nHoffman initially hoped to become a classical pianist, having studied piano during much of his youth and in college. While at Santa Monica College, he also took an acting class, which he assumed would be easy, and \"caught the acting bug.\" He recalls: \"I just was not gifted in music. I did not have an ear.\" Now an aspiring actor, he spent the next ten years doing odd jobs, being unemployed, and struggling to get any available acting roles, a lifestyle he was later to portray in the film Tootsie. Hoffman composed a song called \"Shooting the Breeze\", and Bette Midler wrote the words.His first acting role was at the Pasadena Playhouse, alongside future Academy Award–winner Gene Hackman. After two years there, Hackman headed for New York City, with Hoffman soon following. Hoffman, Hackman, and Robert Duvall lived together in the 1960s, all three of them focused on finding acting jobs. Hackman remembers, \"The idea that any of us would do well in films simply didn\\'t occur to us. We just wanted to work\". Hoffman\\'s appearance—Duvall described him as Barbra Streisand in drag—and small size made him uncastable, Vanity Fair later wrote. During this period, Hoffman got occasional television bit parts, including commercials but, needing income, he briefly left acting to teach.\\nHe then studied at Actors Studio and became a dedicated method actor. In 1960 Hoffman was cast in a role in an Off-Broadway production and followed with a bit part in a Broadway production, A Cook for Mr. General (1961). In 1962, appeared in Rabbit Run Theatre\\'s summer stock production of Write Me A Murder in Madison, Ohio and served as an assistant director to Ulu Grosbard on The Days and Nights of Beebee Fenstermaker at Off-Broadway\\'s Sheridan Square Playhouse. In 1964, Hoffman appeared in Three Men on a Horse at Princeton\\'s McCarter Theatre and in 1965, in Off-Broadway\\'s Harry, Noon and Night with Joel Grey. Grosbard and Hoffman reunited for a 1965 recording of Death of a Salesman starring Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Dunnock, with Hoffman playing Bernard. He assistant directed Grosbard\\'s 1965 Off-Broadway production of A View from the Bridge starring Robert Duvall and Jon Voight and in late 1965, stage managed and appeared in Grosbard\\'s The Subject Was Roses on Broadway. Hoffman\\'s \"sharply outlined and vividly colored\" performance in Off-Broadway\\'s The Journey of the Fifth Horse in April 1966 was followed by another critical success in the play Eh?, by Henry Livings, which had its U.S. premiere at the Circle in the Square Downtown on October 16, 1966. Sidney W. Pink, a producer and 3D-movie pioneer, discovered Hoffman in one of his off-Broadway roles and cast him in Madigan\\'s Millions. Through the early and mid-1960s, Hoffman made appearances in television shows and movies, including Naked City, The Defenders and Hallmark Hall of Fame. \\nHoffman made his film debut in The Tiger Makes Out in 1967, alongside Eli Wallach. In 1967, immediately after wrapping up principal filming on The Tiger Makes Out, Hoffman flew from New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, where he directed productions of William Gibson\\'s Two for the Seesaw and William Saroyan\\'s The Time of Your Life for the Fargo-Moorhead Community Theatre. The $1,000 he received for the eight-week contract was all he had to hold him over until the funds from the movie materialized.\\n\\n1960s\\nIn 1966 director Mike Nichols auditioned Hoffman for a lead role in the Broadway musical The Apple Tree but rejected him because he could not sing well enough and gave Alan Alda the part. But Nichols was so impressed with Hoffman\\'s overall audition he cast him as the male lead in the movie The Graduate (1967). Hoffman played the character of Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate who has an affair with Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father\\'s law partner. This was Hoffman\\'s first major role, and he received an Academy Award nomination for it but lost to Rod Steiger for In the Heat of the Night.\\n\\nAlthough Life magazine joked that \"if Dustin Hoffman\\'s face were his fortune, he\\'d be committed to a life of poverty\", The Graduate was a gigantic box office hit for Embassy Pictures, making Hoffman a major new star at the same time. The film received near-unanimous good reviews. Time magazine called Hoffman \"a symbol of youth\" who represented \"a new breed of actors.\" The film\\'s screenwriter, Buck Henry, notes that Hoffman\\'s character made conventional good looks no longer necessary on screen:\\n\\nA whole generation changed its idea of what guys should look like. . . . I think Dustin\\'s physical being brought a sort of social and visual change, in the same way people first thought of Bogart. They called him ugly.\\nHoffman\\'s success amazed friends from his early years as an actor, who told him \"You were the last one I expected to make it\". Biographer Jeff Lenburg wrote that \"newspapers across the country were deluged with thousands of letters from fans\", with one example published in The New York Times: \"I identified with Ben....I thought of him as a spiritual brother. He was confused about his future and about his place in the world, as I am. It\\'s a film one digs, rather than understands intellectually\".Turner Classic Movies critic Rob Nixon notes that Hoffman represented \"a new generation of actors.\" He credits Hoffman with breaking \"the mold of the traditional movie star and brought to their roles a new candor, ethnicity, and eagerness to dive deep into complex, even unlikable characters.\" Nixon expands on the significance of the film to Hoffman\\'s career: \"In The Graduate, he created a lasting resonance as Ben Braddock that made him an overnight sensation and set him on the road to becoming one of our biggest stars and most respected actors.\"\\nHoffman, however, mostly credits director Mike Nichols for taking a great risk in giving him, a relative unknown, the starring role: \"I don\\'t know of another instance of a director at the height of his powers who would take a chance and cast someone like me in that part. It took tremendous courage.\"Critic Sam Kashner observed strong similarities between Hoffman\\'s character and that of Nichols when he previously acted with Elaine May in the comedy team of Nichols and May. \"Just close your eyes and you\\'ll hear a Mike Nichols—Elaine May routine in any number of scenes.\" Buck Henry also noticed that \"Dustin picked up all these Nichols habits, which he used in the character. Those little noises he makes are straight from Mike,\" he says.After completing The Graduate, Hoffman turned down most of the film roles offered to him, preferring to go back to New York and continue performing in live theater. He returned to Broadway to appear in the title role of the musical Jimmy Shine. Hoffman won a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance.\\n\\nI was a theater person. That\\'s how my friends were, too, Gene Hackman and Bobby Duvall. I wasn\\'t going to be a movie star. I wasn\\'t going to sell out. We wanted to be really good actors. I told them, \\'I\\'m going out to make this movie. Don\\'t worry, I\\'m coming right back.\\'\\nHoffman was paid $20,000 for his role in The Graduate, but netted just $4,000 after taxes and living expenses. After spending that money, Hoffman filed for New York State unemployment benefits, receiving $55 per week while living in a two-room apartment in the West Village of Manhattan. He was then offered the lead in Midnight Cowboy (1969), which he accepted partly to prove many critics were wrong about his acting range and the variety of characters he could portray. Peter Biskind wrote, \"it was the very contrast between his preppy character in The Graduate, and Ratso Rizzo\" that appealed to Hoffman. \\'I had become troubled,\\' recalls Hoffman, \\'by the reviews that I read of The Graduate, that I was not a character actor, which I like to think of myself as. It hurt me. Some of the stuff in the press was brutal.\\'\" Critics assumed that director Mike Nichols got lucky by finding a typical actor with average acting ability to play the part of Benjamin Braddock.\\n\\nJohn Schlesinger, who would direct Midnight Cowboy and was seeking lead actors, held that same impression. Hoffman\\'s performance as a button-down college graduate and track star was so convincing to Schlesinger, \"he seemed unable to comprehend the fact that he was acting,\" notes Biskind. To help the director, whom he had never met, overcome that false impression, Hoffman met him in Times Square dressed as a homeless person, wearing a dirty raincoat, his hair slicked back and with an unshaven face. Schlesinger was sold, admitting, \"I\\'ve only seen you in the context of The Graduate, but you\\'ll do quite well.\"Midnight Cowboy premiered in theaters across the United States in May 1969. For his acting, Hoffman received his second Oscar nomination and the film won Best Picture. In 1994 the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Biskind considers Hoffman\\'s acting a major accomplishment:\\n\\nMidnight Cowboy makes us a gift of one of the landmark performances of movie history: Dustin Hoffman\\'s Ratso Rizzo, with Jon Voight\\'s Joe Buck a close second. From a cesspool of dark, foul, even taboo material, . . . it rescues a true humanism that need not hide its name.\\nAlso in 1969, Hoffman co-starred with Mia Farrow in the Peter Yates\\'s romantic drama film John and Mary. He received a 1970 British Academy Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film, although the film received mixed reviews. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Motion Picture The film was made fresh off the success of Farrow\\'s performance in Roman Polanski\\'s Rosemary\\'s Baby (1968), and Hoffman\\'s performance in The Graduate which prompted them being hailed on the cover of the February 27, 1969 Time magazine as stars of their generation.\\n\\n1970s\\nThis was followed by his role in Little Big Man (1970), where Jack Crabb, his character, ages from teenager to a 121-year-old man. The film was widely praised by critics, but was overlooked for an award except for a supporting nomination for Chief Dan George. Hoffman continued to appear in major films over the next few years. Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me? (1971), Straw Dogs (also 1971), and Papillon (1973). He returned to Broadway in 1974, directing All Over Town.Hoffman next starred in Lenny (1974), for which he was again nominated for Best Actor. Lenny was based on the life of stand-up comedian Lenny Bruce, who died at the age of 40, and was known for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. Expectations were high that Hoffman would win an Oscar for his portrayal, especially after his similar role in Midnight Cowboy. Film critic Katharine Lowry speculates that director Bob Fosse \"never gave him a chance\" to go far enough into developing the character. \"We never understand what, besides the drugs he injected, made him tick like a time bomb,\" she says.\\n\\nHowever, notes author Paul Gardner, \"directing Lenny, his most ambitious project, exhausted Fosse emotionally and physically. It turned his life inside out,\" with shooting days often lasting 10 to 12 hours:\\nThe Lenny Bruce project, based on Julian Barry\\'s play, had gone through two studios and three scripts, and was a problem child, like Lenny himself. But Fosse wanted to do it, and he wanted Dustin Hoffman.\\nHoffman initially turned the part down, saying: \"I didn\\'t think the script was strong enough and I wasn\\'t sure I was the one to play the role.\" While considering the part, he read Lenny Bruce\\'s autobiography and looked at films with Bruce performing stand-up to live audiences. In the same interview with Playboy he recounted: \"I began to feel an affinity with him, a realization that there was a lot of Lenny Bruce in me. My wife felt it too... I realized that I\\'d have to make use of my own spontaneity because he was so spontaneous. And I admired his guts... That intimacy is what an actor tries to get... It occurred to me that if I had known him, I would have wanted us to be friends... and he was a provocateur, and I love to provoke.\" Movie critic Judith Crist gave Hoffman credit for the ultimate success of the film:\\n\\nWhat is important is that Bruce\\'s routines are so artfully reconstructed, the juice of his creativity so carefully strained, that the claim to genius is justified. And for that Dustin Hoffman deserves full credit, vanishing into the Bruce persona to simply stunning effectiveness,… Hoffman captures the restlessness, the velocity of a man\\'s mouth straining to keep pace with a jet-propelled intelligence…\\nLenny was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Cinematography.All the President\\'s Men (1976) was made less than two years after the Watergate scandal, and starred Hoffman and Robert Redford as the real-life journalists, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, respectively. Based on actual events, Hoffman and Redford play Washington Post reporters who uncover a break-in at the Watergate Hotel and end up investigating a political scandal that reaches all the way to the presidency. The film, as earlier ones, had Hoffman take on a dramatically different character than his previous one (as Lenny Bruce), although both men, Bruce and Bernstein, set their faces against abuses of institutional power, and the tendency for society to ignore such abuses. Author James Morrison compares the two roles: \"As Lenny Bruce in Lenny (1974), Hoffman plays a martyr to the cause of establishment oppression, while in All the President\\'s Men, he plays a reporter exposing presidential malfeasance.\"\\n\\nVincent Canby of The New York Times described the film as \"a spellbinding detective story\". \"The strength of the movie\", he added, was \"the virtually day-to-day record of the way Bernstein and Woodward conducted their investigations.\" The characters portrayed by Hoffman and Redford shared the rank of No. 27 Hero on AFI\\'s 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains list, while Entertainment Weekly ranked All the President\\'s Men as one of the 25 \"Powerful Political Thrillers\".Hoffman next starred in Marathon Man (1976), a film based on William Goldman\\'s novel of the same name, opposite Laurence Olivier and Roy Scheider. Its director, John Schlesinger also directed Hoffman in Midnight Cowboy in 1969. Described as \"Schlesinger\\'s thriller,\" by author Gene D. Phillips, Hoffman plays the hero, Babe Levy, a part-time long-distance runner and graduate student, who suddenly finds himself being pursued by a fugitive Nazi. To put himself in the mindset of someone under severe emotional distress, rather than simply acting, Hoffman did not sleep for days at a time and let his body become disheveled and unhealthy.Goldman describes his inspiration for the novel: \"What if someone close to you was something totally different from what you thought? In the story, Hoffman thinks his brother (Roy Scheider) is a businessman where the reality is that the man is a spy, who has been involved with the Nazi, Szell.\" However, Hoffman remembers a serious disagreement he had with Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay, about how the story ends:\\n\\nI was called on, as the character, to fire point-blank at the Laurence Olivier character, Dr. Szell, and kill him in that last scene. And I said that I couldn\\'t do it. Goldman was quite upset about it, because first of all, how dare I? He wrote the book. \"Your job isn\\'t to rewrite — your job is to play it as written.\" . . . it got nasty. I said, \"Go hire someone else.\"\\nI remember Goldman saying: \"Why can\\'t you do this? Are you such a Jew?\" I said, \"No, but I won\\'t play a Jew who cold-bloodedly kills another human being.\" . . . And that\\'s important to me, that I didn\\'t shoot him in the end. Being a Jew is not losing your humanity and not losing your soul.\\nHoffman\\'s next roles were also successful. He opted out of directing Straight Time (1978), but starred as a thief. His next film, Michael Apted\\'s Agatha (1979), was with Vanessa Redgrave as Agatha Christie, focussing on the missing eleven days of the author\\'s life. The part of Archie Christie was played by Timothy Dalton, then partner of Vanessa Redgrave, and later to star in James Bond movies. Dalton\\'s depiction of cold indifference to his wife produced a perfect foil to Hoffman\\'s portrayal of warm compassion, humour and sensitivity. The film had both romantic and comic moments whilst the overall plot cleverly mirrored one of Christie\\'s detective novels. Agatha was generally very well received by critics, especially in the UK, and maintains an 82% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\\nHoffman next starred in Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) co-starring Meryl Streep and directed by Robert Benton. The film tells the story of a married couple\\'s divorce and its impact on everyone involved, including the couple\\'s young son. Hoffman won his first Academy Award, and the film also received the Best Picture honor, plus the awards for Best Supporting Actress (Streep), Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenply.\\nThe film required Hoffman to change his attitude, from being a \"desensitized advertising art director\" into becoming a \"responsive and concerned daddy\" after his wife (Streep) walks out on him and their six-year-old son, Billy. Hoffman, during the making of the movie, was also going through his own divorce after a ten-year first marriage. Hoffman has said, \"Giving myself permission not only to be present but to be a father was a kind of epiphany for me at that time, that I could get to through my work. . . . I got closer to being a father by playing a father. That\\'s very painful to say.\" The role also reminded him of his own love of children in general:\\n\\nChildren are more interesting than anything. I walk my younger child to school every day and I don\\'t like leaving the school. I would like to sit down on those little chairs, at those little tables, and play. And a child\\'s love is like a drug. To have a child throw his arms about you—it\\'s instant stoned. People talk about the rush heroin gives you: I would say children give you that rush.\\nBenton\\'s directing has been praised by Hoffman, who credits him for inspiring the emotional level supporting many scenes: \"Perfect directors make you emotional. On Kramer vs. Kramer, Robert Benton made me emotional. He was pulling so hard for me. When I didn\\'t think I could do a scene again I\\'d say, \"I can\\'t give it to you, I haven\\'t got it.\" Then he\\'d just get this look on his face and roll the camera and I\\'d say, \"Okay, this is yours.\" That\\'s what he made you want to do for him—to give him one.\"\\n\\n1980s\\nIn Tootsie (1982), Hoffman portrays Michael Dorsey, a struggling actor who finds himself dressing up as a woman to land a role on a soap opera. His co-star was Jessica Lange. Tootsie earned ten Academy Award nominations, including Hoffman\\'s fifth nomination.Under direction by Sydney Pollack, Hoffman\\'s role demanded \"a steady bombardment of opposites—edgy then funny, romantic then realistic, soft then quivering.\" To film critic David Denby, Hoffman\\'s character \"embodies vulnerability and drive in perfect proportion. He has the knack of making everything he does seem perilous, and so audiences feel protective of him and root for him.\" Hoffman\\'s acting was made more difficult than necessary, however, as he was not given the rehearsal time Pollack promised:\\n\\nI like to be very prepared, and I feel that the success or failure of a film is many times determined before you start principal photography. I wanted rehearsal very much. I was promised two weeks and was grieved that I didn\\'t get it. We also followed the risky course of starting to shoot with a screenplay that wasn\\'t completed.\\nFellow actor Gary Oldman reported that, during a telephone conversation with Hoffman, the latter recalled having made comments toward a \"very powerful\" industry figure who ensured that he was unable to find work in Hollywood for some time following Tootsie. In 1983, Hoffman became a Major Donor for The Mirror Theater Ltd, alongside Paul Newman and Al Pacino, matching a grant from Laurance Rockefeller. The men were inspired to invest by their connection with Lee Strasberg, as Lee\\'s then daughter-in-law Sabra Jones was the Founder and Producing Artistic Director of The Mirror.In 1984, Hoffman starred as Willy Loman in the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller\\'s play Death of a Salesman. He reprised his role in a TV movie of the same name, for which he won the 1985 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor along with a Golden Globe.Hoffman first read the play at the age of 16, but today considers the story much like his own: \"It was a blueprint of my family. I was the loser, the flunky, and my brother, a high-school varsity football player, was Biff.\" Author Marie Brenner notes that Hoffman \"has been obsessed with the play\" throughout his career: \"For years he has wanted to be Willy Loman; when he discovered that Arthur Miller was his neighbor in Connecticut, they began to talk about it in earnest.\" For Hoffman, the story also left a deep emotional impact from the time he first read it:\\n\\nI read that play, and I was just destroyed by it. It was like finding out something terrible about my family. I just shook. I felt like my family\\'s privacy had been invaded. I couldn\\'t even talk about it for weeks.\\nHoffman rehearsed for three weeks with the play\\'s original star, Lee J. Cobb, and remembers seeing his stage performance: \"I\\'ll never forget that period in my life. It was so vivid, so intense, watching Lee J. Cobb and his sixteen-inch guns as Willy. God, how I think about what I saw on that stage!\" Brenner adds that Hoffman \"has been training like a boxer for the role that so exhausted Cobb he had to be replaced after four months.\" The original play was directed by Elia Kazan, who Hoffman considers \"the perfect director, the best there ever was. . . . God, I would have done anything to have worked with Kazan.\"Hoffman\\'s worst film failure was Elaine May\\'s Ishtar (1987), co-starring Warren Beatty, who also produced it. Hoffman and Beatty play two down-and-out singer-songwriters who travel to Morocco for a nightclub gig and get caught up in foreign intrigue. Much of the movie was filmed in Africa. The film faced severe production problems, mostly related to its $55 million cost, and received overwhelmingly negative reviews. However, Hoffman and Beatty liked the film\\'s final cut and tried to defend it. Hoffman and Beatty were unaffected by the flop, and Ishtar became a cult film. Quentin Tarantino, for one, has called it one of his favorite movies, partly due to the humorous lyrics of the songs written by Paul Williams. Hoffman describes why he loves the film:\\n\\nThe thing I love about Ishtar - and I love it with all of its flaws - is that it has a statement to make. And that is: It is far, far better to spend a life being second rate in something that you\\'re passionate about, than to spend a life being first-rate at that which you are not passionate about. I thought that was worth making a movie about. These guys want to be Simon & Garfunkel, but they have no talent at all. They\\'re middle-aged guys, and at the end of the movie they wind up singing \"That\\'s Amore\" at a Holiday Inn in Morocco. It\\'s fair. It\\'s fair to make a movie about that.\\nNext came director Barry Levinson\\'s Rain Man (1988), where Hoffman starred as an autistic savant, opposite Tom Cruise. Levinson, Hoffman and Cruise worked for two years on the film, and Hoffman\\'s performance gained him his second Academy Award. Behind Hoffman\\'s motivation for doing the film, he has said, \"Deep inside, Rain Man is about how autistic we all are.\" In preparation for the part, Hoffman spent two years befriending autistic people, which included taking them bowling and to fast food restaurants. \"It fed my obsession,\" he has stated.Hoffman worked at the New York Psychiatric Institute, affiliated with Columbia University, when he was 21. \"It was a great experience for me,\" he said. \"All my life I had wanted to get inside a prison or a mental hospital. . . . I wanted to get inside where behavior, human behavior, was so exposed. All the things the rest of us were feeling and stopping up were coming out of these people.\" He used that experience to help him develop the character of Raymond Babbitt, a high-functioning autistic savant, yet a person who critic David Denby described as \"a strangely shuttered genius.\" Hoffman created certain character traits for Raymond. Denby noted: \"Hoffman, looking suddenly older and smaller, has developed a small shuffling walk for Raymond, with shoulder bent. His eyes don\\'t make contact with anyone else\\'s, and he flattens his voice to a dry nasal bark.\"\\n\\nRain Man won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hoffman, and Best Director for Barry Levinson. Having worked closely with Hoffman for two years on filming, Levinson offered some opinions about his skill as an actor:\\n\\nYou can\\'t define Dustin Hoffman, because he\\'s unique. He\\'s one of a kind and he\\'s not one character. There is no Dustin Hoffman. He is many, many people. . . . He can do comedy and he can do drama. He has an enormous range, and yet he\\'s still Dustin somewhere in there. He\\'s intelligent and has a great sense of how to connect with people, because he\\'s very interesting. On a day-to-day basis, he\\'s like an actor who\\'s making his first movie, with the enthusiasm and energy to want to make things happen and try things and experiment.\\nAfter Rain Man, Hoffman appeared with Sean Connery and Matthew Broderick in Family Business (1989), directed by Sidney Lumet. The story centers on the estrangement between Vito (Hoffman), a middle-aged man trying to succeed in a legitimate business, and his \"hopelessly corrupt but charming father,\" Jesse (Connery). Critics were mostly not impressed with the story, although the individual performances were praised, especially Connery\\'s.Because of their different acting styles and nationalities, some industry writers thought Connery and Hoffman might not work well together as close family members. \"To the surprise of many,\" note Connery biographers Lee Pfeiffer and Lisa Philip, \"the two superstars developed an immediate rapport and chemistry that translates onto the screen.\" And Lumet remembered: \"Sean is extremely disciplined and Dustin is very improvisational, all over the place with his lines. I didn\\'t know where it would end up, but Sean met Dustin improvisation for improvisation, and a great deal of richness and humor came out of it.\"\\n\\n1990s\\nIn 1991, Hoffman voiced substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom in The Simpsons episode \"Lisa\\'s Substitute\", under the pseudonym Sam Etic. As a reference to this episode, during the episode featuring the Itchy & Scratchy movie, Lisa claims that Dustin Hoffman had a cameo in that movie but didn\\'t use his real name.\\nThroughout the 1990s, Hoffman appeared in many large, studio films, such as Dick Tracy (1990) (where his Ishtar co-star Beatty plays the titular character), Hero (1992) and Billy Bathgate (1991) co-starring with Nicole Kidman (who was nominated for a Golden Globe). Hoffman also played the title role of Captain Hook in Steven Spielberg\\'s Hook (also 1991), earning a Golden Globe nomination, and the narrator in Dr. Seuss Video Classics: Horton Hears a Who! (also 1992); in Hook, Hoffman\\'s costume was so heavy that he had to wear an air-conditioned suit under it.\\nHoffman played the lead role in Outbreak (1995), alongside Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Donald Sutherland. In the film, Hoffman is a medical doctor who uncovers a newly discovered Ebola-like virus which came to the U.S. from Africa in an infected monkey. Hoffman races to stop the virus\\'s spread and find a vaccine before it becomes a worldwide pandemic with no cure. It was one of the films that was produced by his production banner, Punch Productions.The movie is described by critic Roger Ebert as \"one of the great scare stories of our time, the notion that deep in the uncharted rain forests, deadly diseases are lurking, and if they ever escape their jungle homes and enter the human bloodstream, there will be a new plague the likes of which we have never seen.\" Critic David Denby credits Hoffman with giving the movie much of its thriller-like quality:\\n\\nTanks and men pour in to herd the terrified population here and there, and Dustin Hoffman, as the supersleuth Army doctor, gives such a lip-biting, anguished performance he absolves the movie of slickness. Hoffman isn\\'t good, exactly; he\\'s tense, edgy, and righteous, like a B-movie actor from the fifties.\\nFollowing that, he appeared in the 1996 revenge drama/legal thriller Sleepers (1996) with Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, and Kevin Bacon.\\nIn the mid-1990s, Hoffman starred in—and was deeply involved in the production of—David Mamet\\'s American Buffalo (also 1996), and an early effort of film editor Kate Sanford. In 1997, Hoffman starred opposite John Travolta in the Costa Gavras film Mad City.\\nHoffman gained his seventh Academy Award nomination for his performance in Wag The Dog (1997), in a role that allowed Hoffman the chance to work with both Robert De Niro and Denis Leary. The movie is a black comedy film produced and directed by Barry Levinson, who also directed Hoffman in Rain Man in 1988.\\nThe story takes place a few days before a presidential election, where a Washington, D.C. spin doctor (De Niro) distracts the electorate from a sex scandal by hiring a Hollywood film producer (Hoffman) to construct a fake war with Albania. Hoffman, as a caricature of real life producer Robert Evans, according to some, \"gives the kind of wonderfully funny performance that is liable to win prizes, especially since its mixture of affection and murderous parody is so precise. Stanley (Hoffman) conducts business meetings in tennis clothes or in robe and slippers,\" notes critic Janet Maslin.He next appeared in another Barry Levinson film, the science fiction psychological thriller, Sphere (1998), opposite Sharon Stone.\\nIn 1999, Hoffman received the AFI Life Achievement Award and recalls the emotional impact that receiving the award had on him:\\n\\nThere was this reel of pictures, me playing all these different roles. I had my first—and only, thank God—panic attack. What followed was depression. . . . It had to do with a central core in me, which was that I never felt I deserved success.\\n\\n2000s\\nHoffman next appeared in Moonlight Mile (2002), followed by Confidence (2003) opposite Edward Burns, Andy García and Rachel Weisz. Hoffman finally had a chance to work with Gene Hackman in Gary Fleder\\'s Runaway Jury (also 2003), an adaptation of John Grisham\\'s bestselling novel.\\nHoffman played theater owner Charles Frohman in the J. M. Barrie historical fantasia Finding Neverland (2004), costarring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. In director David O. Russell\\'s I Heart Huckabees (also 2004), Hoffman appeared opposite Lily Tomlin as an existential detective team member.\\nSeven years after his nomination for Wag the Dog, Hoffman got another opportunity to perform again with Robert De Niro, co-starring with Streisand and Ben Stiller in the 2004 comedy Meet the Fockers, a sequel to Meet the Parents (2000). Hoffman won the 2005 MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance. In 2005, he voiced a horse in Racing Stripes, and appeared in cameo roles in Andy García\\'s The Lost City and on the final episode of HBO sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm\\'s fifth season. Hoffman appeared in Stranger than Fiction (2006), played the perfumer Giuseppe Baldini in Tom Tykwer\\'s film Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (also 2006), and had a cameo in the same year\\'s The Holiday.\\nIn 2007, he was featured in an advertising campaign for Australian telecommunications company Telstra\\'s Next G network, appeared in the 50 Cent video \"Follow My Lead\" as a psychiatrist, and played the title character in the family film Mr. Magorium\\'s Wonder Emporium. In 2008, although he was reluctant to perform in an animated feature film (Although he had previously performed voices in a version of The Point! and in an episode of The Simpsons), Hoffman had a prominent role as Shifu in the film Kung Fu Panda, which was praised in part for his comedic chemistry with Jack Black (whom he tutored in acting for an important scene) and his character\\'s poignantly complex relationship with the story\\'s villain. He later won the Annie Award for Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for Kung Fu Panda and has continued into the role in the franchise\\'s subsequent filmed productions outside of the franchise\\'s television series. He next voiced Roscuro in The Tale of Despereaux.\\nAs the title character in Last Chance Harvey, Hoffman acted with co-star Emma Thompson in the story of two lonely people who tentatively forge a relationship over the course of three days. Director Joel Hopkins notes that Hoffman was a perfectionist and self-critical: \"He often wanted to try things stripped down, because less is sometimes more. He worries about every little detail.\"\\n\\n2010s\\nHe appears in Little Fockers, the critically panned yet financially successful 2010 sequel to Meet the Fockers. However, his character plays a significantly smaller role than in the previous installment.\\nIn 2011, Hoffman reprised his role as Master Shifu in the commercially and critically successful animated film Kung Fu Panda 2. On the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 169 reviews, and an average rating of 6.9/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"The storyline arc may seem a tad familiar to fans of the original, but Kung Fu Panda 2 offers enough action, comedy, and visual sparkle to compensate.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The film was a financial success making more money than the previous film, Kung Fu Panda. The film made $666 million at the worldwide Box Office. The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.In 2012, Hoffman\\'s audiobook recording of Jerzy Kosinski\\'s Being There was released at Audible.com. Hoffman starred in the HBO horse racing drama Luck, as a man involved in bookmaking and casino operations. Luck was canceled in March 2012 after three horses died on set.\\n\\nIn 2012, Hoffman\\'s directorial debut film Quartet starring Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins, Billy Connolly, and Michael Gambon\\nThe BBC comedy-drama premiered at the 2012 Toronto Film Festival where it earned respectable reviews from critics. The film is certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes earning an 80% with the critical consensus reading, \"It\\'s sweet, gentle, and predictable to a fault, but Dustin Hoffman\\'s affectionate direction and the talented cast\\'s amiable charm make Quartet too difficult to resist.\" Smith was nominated for Golden Globe for her performance.In 2015, Hoffman starred in Roald Dahl\\'s Esio Trot, a BBC television film adaptation of Roald Dahl\\'s classic novel. Adapted by Richard Curtis and co-starring Judi Dench, Hoffman received an Emmy Award for Best Performance by an Actor.In 2017, Hoffman starred Noah Baumbach\\'s Netflix film The Meyerowitz Stories alongside Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Elizabeth Marvel and Emma Thompson. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2017 where it received a four-minute standing ovation.\\nThe film received a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus reading, \"The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) observes the family dynamic through writer-director Noah Baumbach\\'s bittersweet lens and the impressive efforts of a remarkable cast\".In 2017, Hoffman was honored with the Gotham Awards Tribute alongside Sofia Coppola, Nicole Kidman, Edward Lachman. Hoffman was introduced by Elizabeth Marvel.\\n\\n2020s\\nIn 2019 Hoffman was cast in Mayim Bialik\\'s directorial debut, As Sick as They Made Us acting alongside Candice Bergen, Olivia Thirlby, and Simon Helberg. The film had been set for an October 2020 release date, before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.In 2020, it was announced that Hoffman would make his return to the Broadway stage in Scott Rudin\\'s revival of Our Town as the Stage Manager. Hoffman\\'s last appearance on stage was 30 years prior in Death of a Salesman in 1989. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Broadway theaters will be shut until 2021.\\n\\nFilmography\\nAwards and nominations\\nHonors and legacy\\nIn 1999, Hoffman was honored by the American Film Institute’s who celebrated him with the 27th Life Achievement Award. Those who praised him and celebrated his work included, Edward Norton, Jon Voight, Goldie Hawn, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Kathy Bates. Jack Nicholson presented Hoffman with the award. Upon receiving the award he quoted the poet Emily Dickinson, “Not knowing when the dawn will come, I open the door\".In 2009, Hoffman received an Honorary Cesar Medal at the César Awards.In 2012, Dustin Hoffman received Kennedy Center Honors, with the following commendation: \"Dustin Hoffman\\'s unyielding commitment to the wide variety of roles he plays has made him one of the most versatile and iconoclastic actors of this or any other generation\". Those who honored him at the ceremony included Robert De Niro, Liev Schreiber, Naomi Watts, and Billy ConnollyIn 2017, the Gotham Awards announced that they would Hoffman for his lifetime achievement in film. The director of the Independent Filmmaker Project or (IFP) and Made in NY Media Center stated, \"We are thrilled to present Dustin Hoffman with the Actor Tribute. Starting with his breakthrough role in the timeless classic The Graduate to his highly praised turn in his upcoming film, The Meyerowitz Stories, Dustin’s wide range of roles – often portraying antiheroes or the marginalized – and the creative choices he has embodied in these complex characters, has firmly placed him amongst the most compelling actors to have graced the screen\" Elizabeth Marvel introduced Hoffman where she talked about the influence he\\'s had over her career and stated, \"His work is never anything less than extraordinary\".\\n\\nPersonal life\\nMarriage and relationships\\nHoffman said that when young and single he and Duvall were \"obsessed with sex\". As acting students,\\nThere were always a few models. One comes up to you and says, \"Hi,\" like you\\'ve never looked at her, while for six months you\\'ve been imagining her in bed with you. And she says, \"I\\'d like to do a scene with you,\" and, whoa, she picks a love scene, and you\\'re rehearsing and it’s \"Yes!\" That happened to me and to Bobby. Much as we were adherents to our craft, we looked for classes with women.\\nAfter meeting in 1963, Hoffman married Anne Byrne in May 1969. He adopted Karina (b. 1966), Byrne\\'s child from a previous marriage, and with Byrne had daughter Jenna (born October 15, 1970). In 1970 Hoffman and Byrne were living in Greenwich Village in a building next door to a townhouse occupied at the time by members of the Weathermen, when a bomb was accidentally detonated in the townhouse\\'s basement, killing three. In the 2002 documentary The Weather Underground, Hoffman can be seen standing in the street during the aftermath of the explosion. The couple divorced in 1980.\\nHe married businesswoman Lisa Gottsegen in October 1980; they have four children: Jacob Edward (born March 20, 1981), Rebecca Lillian (b. March 17, 1983), Maxwell Geoffrey (born August 30, 1984), and Alexandra Lydia \"Ali\" (born October 27, 1987). Hoffman has two grandchildren. In an interview, he said that all of his children from his second marriage had bar or bat mitzvahs and that he is a more observant Jew now than when he was younger. He has also lamented that he is not fluent in Hebrew.\\n\\nPolitical activism\\nA liberal, Hoffman has long supported the Democratic Party and Ralph Nader. In 1997 he was one of a number of Hollywood stars and executives to sign an open letter to then-German chancellor Helmut Kohl protesting the treatment of Scientologists in Germany, which was published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune.\\n\\nCancer treatment\\nHoffman was successfully treated for cancer in 2013.\\n\\nSexual misconduct allegations\\nIn 2017, seven women accused Hoffman of sexual misconduct. A woman who was 17 at the time alleged that, while working as an intern on a TV production of Death of a Salesman, Hoffman made inappropriate jokes and comments around her and asked her to give him foot massages. Hoffman released an apology to the 17-year-old intern who alleged harassment but denied wrongdoing, saying, \"I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation,\" continuing, \"I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am.\" In a 1979 Time magazine interview, Meryl Streep claimed that Hoffman groped her breast on their first meeting.  However, in an extensive interview with Tom Hanks for The New York Times to promote The Post in 2018, when asked directly \"people are wondering if you had problems with Dustin Hoffman\" when they worked together on Kramer vs. Kramer in 1979, Streep made no mention of this, referring instead to an incident when Hoffman slapped her for a scene, saying he actually hit her, which was \"overstepping\".In December 2017, comedian John Oliver unexpectedly questioned Hoffman about the allegations during the 20th anniversary screening of Wag the Dog at the 92nd Street Y. \"It\\'s \\'not reflective of who I am\\' – it\\'s that kind of response to this stuff that pisses me off,\" Oliver said. \"Do you understand how that feels like a dismissal?\" Hoffman said he felt blindsided by the line of questioning, remarking \"You\\'ve made the case better than anyone else can. I\\'m guilty. Because someone has alleged something, I\\'m guilty. You push a button. It\\'s all over the world: I\\'m a predator. I\\'m this and that, and it\\'s not true.\" Hoffman has not publicly responded to the other six allegations. During an appearance on The Russell Howard Hour weeks later, Oliver expressed disappointment that his and Hoffman\\'s conversation \"became such a big story because then it became about [Oliver\\'s] questions rather than [Hoffman\\'s] answers\"—answers Oliver called \"kind of not great\"—and said that he had \"tried and failed\" to have a more constructive conversation with Hoffman on the subject.Bill Murray, who costarred with Hoffman in Tootsie (1982) and The Lost City (2005) defended him, saying, \"I heard what happened to him, and Dustin Hoffman is a really decent person. He\\'s crazy, a Borscht Belt flirt, has been his whole life. (But) he\\'s a really sweet man.\"  Also coming to his defense were actors \\nChevy Chase and Liam Neeson.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nDustin Hoffman at the Encyclopædia Britannica\\nDustin Hoffman at IMDb\\nDustin Hoffman at the Internet Broadway Database \\nDustin Hoffman at the Internet Off-Broadway Database',\n",
              " 'Edge of Tomorrow': 'Edge of Tomorrow (marketed as Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow on home media, or simply Live Die Repeat) is a 2014 American science fiction action film starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. Doug Liman directed the film based on a screenplay adapted from the 2004 Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. The film takes place in a future where most of Europe is invaded by an alien race. Major William Cage (Cruise), a public relations officer with no combat experience, is forced by his superiors to join a landing operation against the aliens, only to find himself experiencing a time loop as he tries to find a way to defeat the invaders.\\nIn late 2009, 3 Arts Entertainment purchased the rights to the Japanese novel and sold a spec script to the American studio Warner Bros. The studio produced the film with the involvement of 3 Arts, the novel\\'s publisher Viz Media, and Australian production company Village Roadshow. Filming began in late 2012, taking place in England: at WB Studios in Leavesden, outside London, and other locations, such as London\\'s Trafalgar Square and the coastal Saunton Sands. A total of nine companies handled the visual effects.\\nWarner Bros. spent over $100 million advertising the film. It was released in cinemas on the weekend of May 30, 2014, in 28 territories, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Spain, and Indonesia. On the weekend of June 6, it was released in 36 additional territories, including North America (United States and Canada), Australia, China, and Russia. The film received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the plot, direction, action sequences and performances of Cruise and Blunt. It grossed over $370.5 million worldwide in its theatrical run. A sequel, titled Live Die Repeat and Repeat, is in development.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 2015, aliens called \"Mimics\" arrive in Germany via an asteroid and swiftly conquer most of continental Europe. By 2020, the United Defense Force (UDF), a global military alliance established to combat the alien threat, finally achieves a victory over the Mimics at Verdun using newly developed mech-suits. In Britain, the UDF plans a major invasion of France, and General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders recently attached U.S. Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) of the media relations department to cover it. Cage, having no combat experience, objects and threatens to blame Brigham should the invasion fail. Brigham has Cage arrested and sent to Heathrow Airport, now a military base. Cage awakens to find Brigham has demoted him to a private and assigned him to Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton) and the misfit J-Squad, who do not take kindly to Cage.\\nThe landing in France is a colossal failure; Farell and J-Squad are quickly killed. Cage uses a Claymore mine to kill an unusually large blue Mimic, but is mortally wounded by the explosion and covered in the alien\\'s blood. Cage jolts awake to find himself back at Heathrow, reliving the events of the previous morning. His attempts to warn Farell against the invasion are ignored, and he repeats the loop of dying on the beach and waking at Heathrow again and again. During one loop, Cage tries to save Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a celebrated hero of the battle of Verdun. She realizes Cage can loop time and orders him to find her the next time he wakes up.\\nCage reawakens and locates Vrataski, who takes him to Dr. Carter (Noah Taylor), an expert in Mimic biology. He explains that the Mimics are a superorganism in which the \"Omega\" controls the cerebrum, while the \"Alphas\" behave as the ganglia through which the Omega controls ordinary Mimics; If an Alpha is terminated, the Omega resets the day and adjusts its tactics until the battle is won. Cage inadvertently \"hijacked\" their ability to reset time through his exposure to an Alpha\\'s blood. Vrataski had this ability at Verdun, using it to win the battle before she was wounded and received a blood transfusion, losing the power. She tells Cage to locate and kill the Omega to end the alien invasion.\\nOver many more loops, Vrataski trains Cage to excel in combat. With each loop, he becomes increasingly skilled in combat. After a frustrating lesson, Cage escapes to London, only to discover that the Mimics will attack there next after the invasion. After seeing visions of a dam in Germany where the Omega is hiding and spending many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam, Cage grows closer to Vrataski, but she is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where Vrataski is killed no matter what they do, Cage flies to the dam alone. The Omega is not there and he is ambushed by an Alpha who attempts to strip him of his ability to reset time, but Cage deliberately drowns himself.\\nCage and Vrataski infiltrate the Ministry of Defence, where Cage convinces Brigham to give him Carter\\'s prototype device that can locate the Omega. In the ensuing car chase, they discover the Omega is under the Louvre Pyramid in Paris. Cage is captured and seriously injured, waking in a hospital to find he has been given a blood transfusion and has lost the ability to loop time.\\nVrataski frees Cage and they recruit J-Squad to help destroy the Omega before the invasion begins. They fly to Paris, where the soldiers sacrifice themselves so that Cage and Vrataski can reach the Louvre. Before luring away an Alpha standing between them and the submerged Omega, Vrataski kisses Cage to thank him for getting her as far as he did. When the Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, he manages to drop a belt of grenades that destroys the Omega, killing the Alpha and the Mimics.\\nAs a dying Cage floats down into the Omega\\'s blood, he awakens en route to his first meeting with Brigham, who announces on TV that Mimic activity has ceased following a mysterious energy surge in Paris. Cage goes to Heathrow, now a Major again, and sees that all of J-Squad is alive. He later finds Vrataski, who greets him as coldly as she did in previous loops. Cage laughs.\\n\\nCast\\nCrew\\nProduction\\nDevelopment and writing\\nViz Media published the novel in North America in 2009. After drawing the interest of producer Erwin Stoff, his company 3 Arts Entertainment optioned the novel that same year. 3 Arts collaborated with the publisher\\'s filmmaking subsidiary Viz Productions, headed by Jason Hoffs. Viz Media president Hidemi Fukuhara served as executive producer. Instead of making a pitch to a major studio to purchase the property and proceed with writing and producing a film adaptation, the company developed a spec script to show the studios. Stoff approached writer Dante Harper and sent him a copy of the novel. Harper found the book \"too complex\" to properly adapt, but, despite the prospect of not getting paid, he chose to \"risk it\" and accepted the job, taking eight months to write the script. Upon completion, Warner Bros. purchased it in a $3 million deal in April 2010. The studio hired Doug Liman to direct the film the following August. Harper\\'s screenplay was listed in the 2010 edition of the Black List, a survey of most-liked unproduced screenplays.In June 2011, Joby Harold was hired to rework the screenplay. By September, Warner approached Brad Pitt to star; after he declined, the studio then approached Tom Cruise. Once Cruise accepted, the script changed the age of the leading role to fit the actors. In December 2011, Cruise officially joined the film. Emily Blunt entered negotiations to star opposite Cruise in April 2012. Screenwriting duo Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman also delivered a draft of their own.Six months before filming started, Liman discarded two-thirds of Harper\\'s original script. Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth were hired to rewrite the script. Screenwriter Simon Kinberg took over from the Butterworths, and eight weeks before the start of filming, he was replaced by Christopher McQuarrie. McQuarrie was introduced to the project while directing Cruise in Jack Reacher. While reading the earlier script McQuarrie \"understood very clearly what the premise of the story was and what they were looking for in terms of characters\". Even if the previous scripts were darker, Cruise stressed the importance of the story\\'s humor to McQuarrie. The actor compared Cage\\'s violent demises to Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, declaring, \"It\\'s fun coming up with new ways to kill yourself.\"The screenplay did not yet have a satisfactory ending, and, despite the producers and studio executives worried about starting filming without a set conclusion, Liman opted to finish the script during principal photography. McQuarrie at one point suggested adding a twist involving the Mimics figuring out Cage\\'s attack on Paris and resetting time during his strike, but discarded it as \"you were so exhausted by the time you got to that point.\" Eventually, McQuarrie considered that focusing on the comedic aspects meant \"it needed to end in a way that wasn\\'t harsh\", and thus opted to end the plot where it started, on the helicopter bringing Cage to London, fulfilling the notion that \"comedies generally have to go back to the way things were\".\\n\\nFilming\\nProduction began at Leavesden Studios near London, which Warner Brothers had purchased as a permanent studio site. WB had been renting space there for its production of the Harry Potter films, but had been leaving the sets up permanently for nearly a decade and eventually chose to make the site semi-permanent. The parts with Tom Cruise in the opening scene were filmed in Liman\\'s editing room, with the actor doing his own make-up and hair, leading the director to say it \"may be the most independent thing I\\'ve ever done.\" Though Liman intended to film the beach battle on location, the studio instead had a beach set built at the studio site. The set was surrounded by chroma key green screens, which the visual effects artists later used to extend the beach with plates shot at Saunton Sands in North Devon. It was intended for the battle scenes to be reminiscent of coastal battles during World War II such as the Invasion of Normandy and the Battle of Dunkirk.Principal photography began at Leavesden on October 1, 2012. The Los Angeles Times said on the second day, Liman \"demanded a total reshoot of everything filmed on Day 1\", which concerned producers. Filming on the beach set was scheduled to last two weeks, but extended to nearly three months due to what the Los Angeles Times called \"the director\\'s self-described \\'workshop-y\\' filming style\". Filming also took place in Trafalgar Square in London on Saturday November 24, 2012. The square was closed to the public, and tanks were brought in to film the action scenes. The brief scene in the Square required closing 36 roads, diverting 122 bus routes and booking all available rooms in nearby hotels and a costly restoration of a historic wicket at a local cricket ground after one of the production helicopters knocked it over. A former army base in the village of Barton Stacey in Hampshire was also used as a filming location for two weeks.Liman said filming took place seven days a week using two crews to film 20 days in addition to what had originally been scheduled. The crew struggled with changeable British weather since the film was supposed to be set in one day and had to maintain the same weather. The indoor beach set also became muddy, requiring the effects artists to enhance the environment with digital sand and surf. Though filming concluded by August 2013, actor Jeremy Piven was added to the cast and extra scenes including him were filmed; ultimately, however, Piven did not appear in the finished film. Cinematographer Dion Beebe made his first feature film with Liman, with whom he had worked previously on commercials. Beebe\\'s approach was to develop \"a world under siege, but not a bleak, dark, post-apocalyptic landscape\"; Beebe preferred to avoid the saturated bleach bypass look. Thirty-five-millimeter film was used instead of digital cameras to evoke the World War II footage that provided inspiration for the battle scenes.\\n\\nBattle suits\\nProduction designer Oliver Scholl and his team worked with lead builder Pierre Bohanna to develop concept art for several battle suit options based on contemporary, real-world powered exoskeleton initiatives, such as those supported by DARPA. When director Doug Liman chose a design, the team built an aluminum prototype frame that had pivot points and hinges. Costume designer Kate Hawley contributed a gritty aesthetic design for the color palettes and surface treatments. While the design was meant to be utilitarian, it was also created so the actors could be seen in the suits and also run in them. The team created a foam mock-up of Tom Cruise so the frame could be tailored for him. The team handcrafted 70 hard material and 50 soft material battle suits in the course of almost five months. There were three versions of the battle suits: \"grunts, dogs, and tanks\". The battle suit for Blunt\\'s character was given red slash marks \"as if to say she had been to hell and back and lived to tell about it.\"Cruise, known for performing his own film stunts, also did so in Edge of Tomorrow. Both he and Blunt wore the heavy metal suits. The battle suits weighed 85 pounds (39 kg) on average. One of the heavier versions was around 130 pounds (59 kg) due to it being equipped with a mock sniper rifle and rocket launcher. Blunt trained three months for her role, \"focusing on everything from weights to sprints to yoga, aerial wire work and gymnastics\", and studying the Israeli combat system Krav Maga.Each actor needed four people to help put on the battle suit. Initially, Cruise needed 30 minutes to put on the suit and another 30 minutes to remove it. Ultimately, the time was reduced to 30 seconds. Between takes, the actors would be suspended by chains from iron frames to take the weight of the suits off their shoulders.\\n\\nVisual effects\\nNine companies handled the visual effects for Edge of Tomorrow under VFX supervisor Nick Davis. Davis worked with the crew of The Third Floor on the film\\'s previsualization process. Sony Pictures Imageworks (SPI) worked on the first two acts of the film and created over 400 shots, including photorealistic environments, battle scenes, and computer-generated creatures and characters. One major shot involved covering London Heathrow Airport with military troops, vehicles, and aircraft; SPI split some of the work with RodeoFX. Cinesite joined late in the production and developed 221 shots for ten key sequences, with 189 appearing in the final cut.\\n\\nDesigners created the alien Mimics to look different from any terrestrial animal. Davis and Liman favored an early model composed primarily of tentacles. SPI\\'s Dan Kramer described its appearance as \"heavy black spaghetti\" and noted that the modelers faced a challenge creating the tentacled creatures. A technical animator created an Autodesk Maya plugin that made the movement of each tentacle independent. Since Liman did not want the Mimics to look \"too organic or terrestrial\", Imageworks\\' artists devised the idea of making the aliens out of an obsidian-like material, \"basically a glass that could cut\". Various debris was incorporated within the tentacles to give the creature a sense of weight and fast movement. The Alphas were given a definable head area to show their status as more sentient, while receiving a different color and a bigger size compared to the Mimic grunts. Cinesite created the mechanical Mimics used in the training areas, while MPC created the Omega in a digital environment into which the effects artists composited underwater footage filmed at Leavesden\\'s water tank.Animators created digital versions of the battle suits, at times with the soldiers inside them. On the set a 3D scanner booth digitized the actors, while hand scanners captured the textures of the practical suits. Imageworks received pieces of the suits for reference. The company\\'s library of reflection data on various materials helped enhance the armor\\'s shading. SPI\\'s crew created the base at Heathrow by merging the set at Leavesden with digitally altered footage from the airport; the film\\'s drop ships, barracks and mess halls, replaced the existing aircraft. Framestore created the digital Paris and recreated it with photomodeling from three days of visits. Given that the city is a no-fly zone, Framestore\\'s artists obtained their aerial images by climbing an 80-meter crane parked in the Louvre courtyard. The quadcopter dropships were based on the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey that can tilt its rotors to fly as either planes or helicopters, while having a design closer to the Quad TiltRotor. Aside from the crashed ship on the beachhead and a gimbal set to depict the plane used by Cage\\'s squad, the film used digital models for most ships. The computer-generated dropships had some of Imageworks\\' heaviest detail given the proximity of the actors to the aircraft in the camp scenes; the effects artists wanted to make sure the ships broke apart in a realistic way during the crashes.Prime Focus World converted the film into 3D in post-production using the same tools for the stereoscopy as in World War Z and Gravity. The company made use of scans of the cast\\'s faces from film production while vendor Nvizible helped the company convert the hologram table used by Dr. Carter.\\n\\nMusic\\nComposer Christophe Beck was a late addition to the film, taking over from Ramin Djawadi, who was Liman\\'s first choice to replace his frequent collaborator John Powell, as Powell was on sabbatical. Edge of Tomorrow marked Beck\\'s first science fiction film score. To prepare, Beck watched the film with temp tracks, including one from the 2012 film Battleship. He experimented with repeating the music with the scenes, but because this approach did not frequently fit the events on the screen, Beck used minimal repetition in the film. \"The day is reset dozens of times in the film and it would get very repetitive to approach that musically the same way every time\", Beck recalled. He initially tried for \"traditional heroic themes\" that involved horns and trumpets, but he said Liman \"preferred a non-traditional approach, driven by percussion and distorted orchestra\". To that end, Beck used the pizzicato playing technique, \"not in the traditional, plinky-plinky-isn\\'t-this-funny way, but a little darker, and always accompanied by some higher concept synth colors\". The distorted orchestral samples enhanced the comedic tone of the extended sequences where Cage recurrently dies in battle, as the director felt it was important for the audience to find humor in this sequence. With Liman\\'s approach, the composer said there were \"only a couple of traditional themes\" in the film, including one for Emily Blunt\\'s character Rita.\\n\\nRelease\\nMarketing\\nWarner Bros. invested over $100 million in a marketing campaign for Edge of Tomorrow. The film was initially titled All You Need Is Kill after the light novel, but as filming was ending in July 2013, Warner Bros. changed the title to Edge of Tomorrow; Warner Bros. president Sue Kroll said the title was changed partly due to \"negative chatter\" about the word \"kill\" in the title. Doug Liman, who said he rejected the title All You Need Is Kill because it \"didn\\'t feel like it was the tone of the movie I had made\", wanted to rename the film Live Die Repeat, but Warner decided to use that just as the tagline.The film was promoted at Comic-Con in San Diego, California in July 2013, and at WonderCon in Anaheim, California in April 2014. Turner Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Time Warner like the studio Warner Bros., promoted the film across its TV properties, including CNN, TNT, TBS, Adult Swim, TruTV, and Funny or Die. Variety said the move \"put forth the notion that buying bigger packages of advertisements across a TV company\\'s holdings is a viable option in an increasingly fragmented TV-viewing landscape\". Turner also launched a website which would unlock film-related content like \"a 3D game, back stories and artwork\" if its promotional hashtag was circulated enough through the social media website Twitter.Viz Media released a new edition of the light novel on April 29, 2014, retitled Edge of Tomorrow. It also published a graphic novel adaptation of the light novel on May 5, 2014.For the film\\'s release on home media, Warner Bros. formed two teams for a September 28, 2014, Tough Mudder endurance event series in Black Diamond, Washington. The teams included YouTube personalities and participants from the TV series American Ninja Warrior. Warner Bros. based the teams on the soldiers from \"J Squad\" in the film. To promote teamwork, the two teams competed in a Tough Mudder obstacle course.\\n\\nBox office forecast\\nWeeks before the film\\'s release, reports in early May 2014 predicted an underwhelming performance in the North American (United States and Canada) box office for Edge of Tomorrow. Variety noted a \"worrisome lack of buzz\" leading up to the film\\'s release. Initial box office tracking at the start of the month for the film estimated a gross between $25 million and $30 million on its opening weekend. Several weeks later, the estimate decreased by $5 million. The film planned to compete with The Fault in Our Stars in the same opening weekend with an equivalent estimated gross around $25 million. TheWrap predicted that this competition could potentially affect the opening weekend gross of Edge of Tomorrow. In contrast, Variety said Edge of Tomorrow could serve as counterprogramming to The Fault in Our Stars since that film\\'s demographic is women under 25 years old.With its budget of over $175 million, The Hollywood Reporter called Edge of Tomorrow, one of the \"biggest box-office risks\" in North America for mid-2014. The trade paper said the film was similar to Oblivion, a 2013 science fiction film that also starred Tom Cruise, and that like Oblivion, it would likely perform better outside North America. Box Office Mojo reported that four of Cruise\\'s films with original material—Valkyrie (2008), Knight and Day (2010), Jack Reacher (2012), and Oblivion (2013)—failed to gross more than $100 million in North America. The website forecast that Edge of Tomorrow would gross $90 million in North America and $220 million in other territories. TheWrap said that the studio focused on theatrical releases in other territories where Cruise \"remains a major force\" in drawing audiences. Variety, writing from the US perspective, said, \"Media reports have been quick to speculate that Edge of Tomorrow may be one of the summer\\'s first big bombs based on the lack of enthusiasm by U.S. audiences. That may come to pass, but these reports downplay the centrality of foreign markets in today\\'s globalized movie industry.\"In the week prior to the release of Edge of Tomorrow in North America, its estimated opening-weekend gross increased from the mid-$20 million range to $27 million.\\n\\nTheatrical run\\nEdge of Tomorrow initiated its theatrical run in several territories on May 28, 2014, and rolled out to a total of 28 territories for its opening weekend of May 30 – June 1, 2014. It grossed $20.1 million on its opening weekend. For the second weekend of June 6–8, 2014, it was released in 36 additional territories. Edge of Tomorrow grossed $100.2 million in North America and $270.3 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $370.5 million. After the film\\'s theatrical run, Entertainment Weekly said it had a \"lukewarm box-office reception\" despite praise from critics.\\n\\nOpening weekend\\nThe film had premiere screenings in London, Paris, and New York City on May 28, 2014. The cast and the crew mimicked the film\\'s time loop premise by attending the premieres in a single day, traveling westward to attend them on a staggered schedule. The film was screened in New York City at 11:59 pm, the time chosen to refer to the film title. The film was released in theaters in 28 territories—including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Spain, and Indonesia—on the weekend of May 30, 2014. Certain territories with strong association football followings were chosen so the film could screen to audiences before the month-long 2014 FIFA World Cup began on June 12, 2014. Edge of Tomorrow competed against Maleficent starring Angelina Jolie, which opened the same weekend in 46 territories.On its opening weekend in 5,018 screens across 28 territories, Edge of Tomorrow grossed $20.1 million. The Hollywood Reporter called the film\\'s debut a \"soft\" opening. In many territories, Edge of Tomorrow ranked third behind fellow new release Maleficent and holdover X-Men: Days of Future Past. These included the United Kingdom, where the film ranked third and grossed $3.1 million, where Cruise\\'s 2013 film Oblivion had opened with $7.6 million, and Germany, with an income of $2.1 million compared to Oblivion\\'s $2.6 million. Edge of Tomorrow ranked first in Indonesia and Taiwan, grossing $2 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Its opening weekend in 286 screens in Indonesia was Tom Cruise\\'s biggest opening, to date, in the country. The film also grossed $1.5 million in Italy and $1.5 million in Spain. Deadline.com said the film had good word of mouth, citing significant increases in Saturday grosses compared to the Friday grosses in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain. Bloomberg Businessweek reported that $110 million was grossed in the first week of release and summarized its debut, \"While it did solid business in Asia, its reception in Germany, France, and the U.K. has been tepid.\"\\n\\nSecond weekend\\nIn the first week of June 2014, Edge of Tomorrow opened in 36 additional markets, including North America, China, Russia, South Korea and France. The film was now showing in 63 countries and 19,000 screens. The film led the global weekend box office with $28.8 million in North America and $82 million elsewhere. The debut in China occurred on Monday, June 2, to take advantage of the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. Edge of Tomorrow topped the Chinese box office with $26.7 million, encompassing 4.06 million admissions in 99,768 screenings. Edge of Tomorrow\\'s debut in both Russia ($8.6 million) and South Korea ($3.8 million, taking advantage of a five-day holiday) marked Tom Cruise\\'s highest opening weekend in both countries.Edge of Tomorrow was released in 3,490 theaters in North America on June 6, 2014. The ticket service Fandango reported advance tickets surpassed Tom Cruise\\'s previous film Oblivion, but were being overcome by the competing film The Fault in Our Stars. Edge of Tomorrow grossed $28.8 million on the opening weekend, ranking it third below The Fault in Our Stars ($48 million) and Maleficent ($34.3 million). Polling firm CinemaScore said 61% of the opening weekend audiences were male. It reported that audiences overall gave Edge of Tomorrow a \"B+\" grade, where younger filmgoers gave \"A\" and \"A–\" grades. The Los Angeles Times said the disappointing box office performances of non-franchise films Edge of Tomorrow and Blended, both produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, indicated risky investments by the studio, which had better success earlier in the year with franchise films The Lego Movie and Godzilla (2014).\\n\\nSubsequent weekends\\nIn its second weekend of release in North America (June 13–15, 2014), Edge of Tomorrow had a \"light\" second-weekend drop of 43% due to word of mouth and grossed $16.5 million on the second weekend. In the same weekend in territories outside North America, the film was on 14,725 screens. With approximately 5.1 million admissions, it grossed $37.3 million. China, Russia, and South Korea, respectively, had the film\\'s largest weekend grosses among the territories. In South Korea, the film ranked first at the box office for two consecutive weekends, grossing a total of $25.65 million by June 17, 2014.In Japan, Edge of Tomorrow was released on July 4, 2014, under the light novel\\'s title All You Need Is Kill. The film opened second in the weekend rankings behind Maleficent, with an intake of $4.5 million. As of November 30, 2014, with $15.3 million, Edge of Tomorrow is the sixth-highest-grossing foreign movie of the year in Japan, and the 21st overall.\\n\\nHome media\\nEdge of Tomorrow was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and video on demand in the United States on September 23, 2014. The Blu-ray includes over 90 minutes of bonus features. The home release\\'s packaging downplays the original Edge of Tomorrow title in favor of placing more prominence on the film\\'s original tagline, \"Live. Die. Repeat.\" Media critics believed that the re-branding was an attempt by Warner Bros. to re-launch the film\\'s marketing following its lackluster U.S. box office performance. Posters for the film\\'s theatrical release had similarly placed a larger emphasis on the \"Live. Die. Repeat.\" tagline than the actual title of the film. Similarly, some digital retailers listed the film under the title Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow. The film ranked first in home media sales for the week beginning October 7, with 62% of sales coming from the Blu-ray version. The DVD and Blu-ray releases grossed $27.9 million in the United States.\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nEdge of Tomorrow received largely positive reviews from critics, who praised the humor, Liman\\'s direction, the aliens\\' design, Cruise and Blunt\\'s performances, and the time-loop premise\\'s ability to remain fresh. However, some critics had issues with the film\\'s conclusion. Based on 317 reviews, review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 91% of critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.49/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads: \"Gripping, well-acted, funny, and clever, Edge of Tomorrow offers entertaining proof that Tom Cruise is still more than capable of shouldering the weight of a blockbuster action thriller.\" On another aggregator, Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.Justin Chang of Variety called Edge of Tomorrow \"a cleverly crafted and propulsively executed sci-fi thriller\", saying that the film was director Doug Liman\\'s best since The Bourne Identity (2002). Chang said that the screenwriters, with the assistance of the editors, \"tell their story in a breezy narrative shorthand (and at times, sleight-of-hand), transforming what must surely be an unbelievably tedious gauntlet for our hero into a deft, playful and continually involving viewing experience\". Regarding the relationship between Cruise and Blunt\\'s characters, Chang said \"Liman handles it with a pleasing lightness of touch that extends to the proceedings as a whole.\" He also commended the visual effects of the \"expertly designed Mimics\" as well as Dion Beebe\\'s cinematography.Todd McCarthy, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, said the film was \"a narratively ambitious sci-fi actioner\" that \"takes a relatively playful attitude toward the familiar battle tropes\". McCarthy said that, despite the humor, he found the time loop premise \"tedious\" and that \"the final stretch becomes dramatically unconvincing and visually murky\". However, he also called the effects \"exciting, convincing and gritty\" and applauded Gleeson and Paxton in their supporting roles. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review, considering the film \"a star-driven mass-market entertainment that\\'s smart, exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions\" that broke a string of \"cookie-cutter, been-there blockbusters\".Edge of Tomorrow was listed on 23 critics\\' top ten lists of movies of 2014 (out of 201 evaluated).David Hynes of WhatCulture ranked Dante Harper\\'s original script, All You Need Is Kill (2010), fifth in a list of the \"10 Best Movie Screenplays Since 2010\", considering certain changes made for the film to be detrimental: \"Is it me or does [the title Edge of Tomorrow] suck in comparison? [...] The conflict between Cage and the Mimics is also far more localised to the beach and marine barracks in the screenplay which improves the cohesiveness of the overall story, whereas Cruise finds himself up in a helicopter in no time in the film version.\"\\n\\nAccolades\\nThe theatrical trailer for Edge of Tomorrow was nominated at the 15th Annual Golden Trailer Awards for Best Action and for Best Summer 2014 Blockbuster Trailer, but lost to The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Godzilla, respectively. The film also received nominations at the 2014 Teen Choice Awards for Best Action Film, Best Action Actor (Tom Cruise), and Best Action Actress (Emily Blunt), but lost to Divergent. The Japanese government gave director Doug Liman the Annual Japan Cool Content Contribution Award, an accolade that recognizes creatives who popularize Japanese media for worldwide audiences.Edge of Tomorrow was nominated for Critics\\' Choice Movie Awards in the following categories: Best Visual Effects, Best Action Movie, Best Actor in an Action Movie, and Best Actress in an Action Movie, with Blunt winning the latter.\\n\\nSocial commentary\\nGender roles\\nEmily Blunt plays Sergeant Rita Vrataski, a veteran who guides and trains Tom Cruise\\'s character, Major William Cage. Blunt said of her role, \"In these male-fueled genres, it\\'s usually the woman who\\'s holding the hand of the guy and he\\'s running through explosions leading her, and I wanted to be doing the leading.\" Chris Nashawaty, reviewing the film for Entertainment Weekly, called it \"the most feminist summer action flick in years\". Bustle\\'s Alicia Lutes described Rita as \"ruthless and exacting in her takedown ... of a bunch of aliens\" and said: \"This is very much counter to the age-old ideals about ladies being the constant, delicate flowers of emotional heartstring-pulling.\" Lutes noted how Cage\\'s strength depended on Rita\\'s guidance, as \"she trains him, aids him, and protects him (and in turn the fate of humanity) time and time again.\" Tasha Robinson, writing a piece in The Dissolve about \"strong female characters\" that lack real purpose in films, said that Rita in Edge of Tomorrow was an exception. Robinson acknowledged that Rita existed to support Cage in his trials, but believed that \"the story doesn\\'t degrade, devalue, weaken, or dismiss her\".In contrast, The Wire\\'s Esther Zuckerman criticized the inclusion of a romantic relationship in the film, and said of the two characters\\' kiss: \"There\\'s a case to be made that the kiss is simply an acceptance of their fate, but everything we know about Rita up until this point implies that she\\'s a dedicated soldier, and making her a sudden romantic betrays her character.\" Zuckerman added: \"That\\'s not to say she can\\'t soften up a bit as humans do, but the moment reads less like she\\'s accepting her humanity and more like the filmmakers had to acknowledge two attractive leads ... who should lock lips because that\\'s what men and women do in movies.\" Writing in The Week, Monika Bartyzel also criticized the romance in the film, stating that Rita is the one who kisses Cage, despite knowing him for only a day where he had known her for multiple days via time loop. Bartyzel said that Rita\\'s portrayal was part of a commonly seen motif in which a female character helps a male \"Chosen One\" character, and that this was \"the new normal because it allows Hollywood to appeal to feminist concerns while continuing to feed male wish fulfillment\". Bartyzel said that Rita \"at her most powerful\" ultimately serves \"to make the male hero into a fighter like herself\".\\n\\nComparison to video games\\nLiman said that the film\\'s repeated scenes intentionally paralleled the respawning feature in video games, where players have to start over on a level if their character dies. In the afterword of All You Need Is Kill, author Hiroshi Sakurazaka notes his experience playing video games as a source of inspiration while writing the novel. Salon\\'s Ryan Leas said analyses of the film noted that it \"steals from the video game genre\". Leas called Edge of Tomorrow\\'s looped action \"a meta-commentary on the blockbuster genre\", saying: \"It\\'s a blockbuster interested in the question of how mind-numbing its genre has become to its viewers.\" Comparing Edge of Tomorrow to film adaptations of video games, Wired\\'s Angela Watercutter said Liman\\'s film was more successful for basing itself on the medium\\'s narrative structure, and for its \"ability to continue after \\'Game Over\\' and discover something new\".\\n\\nSequel\\nIn a December 2015 interview with Collider, McQuarrie said that Cruise had an idea for a sequel, and that the concept is \"locked and loaded.\" In April 2016, Doug Liman had signed on to direct the sequel, while Race screenwriters Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse will write the script for the film. In October 2016, Liman stated that the film would \"revolutionize how people make sequels\", and went on to say that the story is \"much better than the original film\" and that it\\'s \"a sequel that\\'s a prequel.\" In May 2017, Liman revealed that the title will be Live Die Repeat and Repeat and that both Cruise and Emily Blunt will reprise their roles from the first film. In January 2018, Liman revealed that Live Die Repeat and Repeat could be his next film and that scheduling issues have been worked out and the film is moving steadily toward a window in which to start production. In March 2018, Liman revealed that he was now working with Jez Butterworth on a script rewrite for the film. Later that month, Blunt stated that she, Cruise and Liman were all enthusiastic about the project, but also noted that \"It\\'s a lot for all the stars to align for everyone to be free at the same time and available to do it at the same time.\" In March 2019, it was reported that Matthew Robinson would rewrite the screenplay, and in October, Liman confirmed that the script was finished. After numerous delays, director Liman stated on Instagram that the project was still in \"planning stages\" as of January 2020.\\n\\nSee also\\nList of films based on manga\\nList of films featuring time loops\\nList of films featuring powered exoskeletons\\nList of science fiction films of the 2010s\\nThe Defence of Duffer\\'s Drift, a 1904 short book with a similar premise\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website\\nEdge of Tomorrow at IMDb\\nEdge of Tomorrow at AllMovie\\nEdge of Tomorrow at the TCM Movie Database\\nEdge of Tomorrow at Box Office Mojo\\nEdge of Tomorrow at Rotten Tomatoes\\nEdge of Tomorrow at Metacritic',\n",

It received generally negative reviews and has a 28% approval rating based on 178 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.\\n\\nPlot\\nDrew Baylor is a designer for a shoe company. When his latest design, hyped to be a great accomplishment in his life, has a flaw that will cost the company $972 million to correct, Drew is shamed by his boss before he is dismissed. Disappointed in his failure, and the subsequent breakup with his girlfriend Ellen, he plans to commit suicide, only to be stopped at the last moment by a call from his sister Heather telling him that his father died while visiting family in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. When his mother Hollie refuses to go, following a dispute between her and the rest of the Kentucky Baylors, Drew volunteers to retrieve the body.\\nOn the flight to Kentucky, Drew meets Claire, an optimistic and kind flight attendant who gives him a seat in first class, due to the plane being empty. She provides helpful advice to a despondent Drew, giving him directions and tips on getting to his destination before they part. When he gets to Elizabethtown, Drew is met by the family, and he makes arrangements for a cremation at his mother\\'s request, despite the family\\'s objections. While staying at a hotel, where a wedding reception is being held, Drew calls his mother and sister, then his ex-girlfriend as he continues to struggle with his suicidal thoughts. Finally, he calls Claire, and the two of them talk for hours. She impulsively suggests they meet before she has to depart on a flight to Hawaii.\\nDrew comes to grips with his father\\'s death, and while he is visiting his Aunt Dora, his uncle Bill remarks on how his father would look in the suit. Drew realizes that he hadn\\'t given the suit to the mortuary to be cremated, and has second thoughts on the procedure. He rushes out to stop the cremation but is too late and is given his father\\'s ashes. Claire returns from her flight and unexpectedly meets him at his hotel, where they have sex.  Afterwards, she tells him she loves him, and he responds with regret that he failed at his life, admitting he was contemplating suicide. Claire leaves upset that Drew had not responded in kind.\\nHollie and Heather arrive for the service, and Hollie tells a series of amusing anecdotes with her eulogy. Claire arrives, and tells Drew to take one final trip with his father, giving him a map with special stops to make along the way. Drew follows the map home, spreading his father\\'s ashes at memorable sites until reaching a farmer\\'s market, where a series of notes gives him a choice; to either follow the map home, or follow new direction. He chooses the latter, where Claire is waiting for him. The two kiss and Drew finally realizes he loves her.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nJane Fonda was cast in Sarandon\\'s role, but had to drop out. Ashton Kutcher, Seann William Scott, Colin Hanks, Chris Evans, and James Franco all auditioned for Bloom\\'s part. Kutcher was actually hired to play Drew, but director Cameron Crowe decided during filming that the chemistry between him and Dunst was not right and Kutcher left the project. Biel auditioned for the female lead, but was given a smaller role as Drew\\'s ex-girlfriend.\\nThere is a character named Ben who is mentioned as a love interest of Claire. In the original cut of the film, Ben is revealed to be Claire\\'s brother.\\nRecognizable settings for scenes shot in Louisville, Kentucky include the Brown Hotel, Highland Middle School, and Cave Hill Cemetery.

Although the exterior, lobby, and corridors of the Brown Hotel are seen, a replica of the Brown Hotel\\'s Crystal Ball Room was re-created on a soundstage. While Bloom\\'s character is supposedly traveling to \"Elizabethtown\" by car, he is going the incorrect direction on the road. He is also pictured going through the Cherokee Park tunnel, which happens to be on I-64. Elizabethtown is on I-65, about 40 miles (64 km) in the other direction.\\nAlthough the title of the movie is Elizabethtown, most of the small town scenes were actually filmed in Versailles, Kentucky. Only two scenes portraying distinctive landmarks were filmed in Elizabethtown itself, because many of Elizabethtown\\'s historic buildings have been replaced by chain stores and sprawl. A few scenes were filmed in LaGrange. Other local scenes were filmed in Otter Creek Park in Meade County, near Brandenburg. Filming also took place in Scottsbluff, Nebraska; Eureka Springs, Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee; and Oklahoma City.In the original cut of the film shown at the Toronto International Film Festival, an epilogue reveals that the shoe designed by Drew turns out to be a hit, as it whistles with every step. This was cut from the release version of the film to prevent the ending seeming overly-drawn out.Joni Mitchell\\'s painting Hyde Park appears in this film. Previously, one of her paintings had appeared in Crowe\\'s Vanilla Sky.\\n\\nRelease\\nCritical reception\\nThe film received generally negative reviews by critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 28% approval rating based on 178 reviews, with an average score of 4.8/10. The site\\'s consensus is \"This story of a floundering shoe designer who returns home for a family tragedy gets lost in undeveloped plot lines and lackluster performances.\" It holds a Metacritic score of 45 out of 100 from 37 critics.Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, with three stars out of four. He describes the story as the most unrelenting \"Meet Cute\" in movie history. He goes on to say that although the film is nowhere near one of Crowe\\'s great films like Almost Famous, it is sweet and good-hearted and has some real laughs. Ebert later reprinted on his site an analysis of the film pointing out various plot elements supporting the idea of Claire being an angel.\\n\\nManic Pixie Dream Girl\\nIn his review, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club created the term \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\" to describe the \"bubbly, shallow cinematic creature\" stock character type that he stated Dunst plays in the film.\\n\\nBox office\\nElizabethtown was commercially released on October 14, 2005 in the United States. It was distributed to 2,517 theaters, and grossed $4,050,915 on its opening day.

              " 'Empire (film magazine)': 'Empire is a British film magazine published monthly by Bauer Consumer Media. The first issue (June/July 1989) was published in May 1989.\\n\\nHistory\\nDavid Hepworth of Emap, the publisher of British music magazines Q and Smash Hits, among other titles, came up with the idea to publish a magazine similar to Q, but for films. They recruited Smash Hits editor Barry McIlheney to edit the new magazine, with Hepworth as Editorial Director. Hepworth produced a one-page document of what he wanted to achieve. Among them, they planned to review and rate every film that was released in the cinema in the United Kingdom. It also said that \"Empire believes that movies can sometimes be art, but they should always be fun.\" The first edition (June/July 1989) was published in May 1989 with Dennis Quaid and Winona Ryder on the front cover from the film Great Balls of Fire!. The first issue reached its target of 50,000 copies sold.Film reviews were given a star rating between 1 and 5, with no half stars.McIlheney edited the first 44 issues, with assistant editor Phil Thomas, who had been working on the magazine since it started, taking over from the March 1993 issue. Thomas became managing editor in 1995 with Q Features Editor Andrew Collins taking over as Empire editor from issue 73 (July 1995); however, after 3 issues, he became editor of Q after Danny Kelly left, with  Empire\\'s Features Editor Mark Salisbury promoted to Editor.A compilation of their film reviews was published in 2006 as the Empire Film Guide.Bauer purchased Emap Consumer Media in early 2008.\\n\\nEditors\\nEmpire has had ten editors:\\n\\nSteven Spielberg guest-edited the magazine\\'s 20th Anniversary Issue in June 2009.\\nSam Mendes guest-edited the magazine\\'s Spectre special in September 2015.\\n\\nRegular features\\nEmpire reviews both mainstream films and art films, but feature articles concentrate on the former.\\nAs well as film news, previews and reviews, Empire has some other regular features. Each issue (with the exception of issues 108–113) features a Classic Scene, a transcript from a notable film scene. The first such classic scene to be featured was the \"I coulda been a contender\" scene from On the Waterfront.The Re.View section covers Blu-ray and DVD news and releases. Kim Newman\\'s Movie Dungeon is a regular feature in the Re.View section, in which critic Kim Newman reviews the most obscure releases, mostly low budget horror movies. Newman has written for Empire since the first issue.How Much Is A Pint of Milk? presents celebrities\\' answers to silly or unusual questions, including the question \"How much is a pint of milk?\" This is intended as a guide to the chosen celebrity\\'s contact with reality, and as such can be more informative than a direct interview by reporting some surprising responses. Willem Dafoe was the first interviewee in issue 59 (May 1994).Each magazine includes a \"Spine Quote\", in which a relatively challenging quote is printed on the spine of the magazine. There are usually some obvious and obscure links from the quote to the main features of that month\\'s edition. Readers are invited to identify the film source and the links to win a prize.\\n\\nThe Empire Masterpiece\\nA regular feature since Raging Bull featured in issue 167 (May 2003), the Empire Masterpiece is a two-page essay on a film selected by Empire in the Re.View section. The selection of the films seem to be quite random and follow no specific pattern. Only a few issues since the first masterpiece feature have not featured one – 179, 196–198 and 246. Issue 241 (June 2009) had director Frank Darabont select 223 masterpieces. L.A. Confidential and Magnolia have been featured twice.\\n\\nFormer features\\nWhere Are They Now? featuring past film celebrities and updating on their current professional and personal status first appeared in issue 28 (October 1991) featuring Mark Hamill and John Savage.My Movie Mastermind was another regular in which a celebrity was given questions about the films they were in or they directed. Celebrities range from Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Lee (who were at the top of the scoreboard) to John Carpenter and Michael Keaton (who were at the bottom of the scoreboard). The feature first appeared in issue 212 (February 2007) with Terry Gilliam.\\n\\nSpecial editions\\nGenre guides\\nIn 2001, Empire published a series of guides to the best films by genre including science fiction, horror, crime, action and comedy.\\n\\nThe Directors Collection\\nIn 2001, Empire published a special issue on Steven Spielberg as part of The Directors Collection.\\n\\nFifteenth anniversary\\nEmpire published a special 15th anniversary issue in June 2004 by which time the magazine had reviewed 4,240 theatrical films. Nicole Kidman was named \"actress of our lifetime\" and Kevin Spacey was named \"actor of our lifetime\". A list of the 15 most influential films of the preceding 15 years was featured.\\n\\nEighteenth anniversary\\nAs part of its 18th birthday issue published in June 2007 Empire published a list of top 18-rated moments in film.

              " 'Endless Love (1981 film)': 'Endless Love is a 1981 American romantic drama film directed by Franco Zeffirelli, starring Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt. Tom Cruise makes his film debut, in a minor role.\\nBased on the 1979 Scott Spencer novel of the same name, the screenplay was written by Judith Rascoe. The original music score was composed by Jonathan Tunick.\\nCritics compared the film unfavorably to the novel, which showcased the dangers of obsessive love. Despite the poor reviews, its eponymous theme song, performed by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie, became a #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. The song spent nine weeks at #1 and received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for \"Best Original Song\", along with five Grammy Award nominations.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn suburban Chicago, teenagers Jade Butterfield and David Axelrod fall in love after they are introduced by Jade\\'s brother Keith.\\nThe Butterfields\\' bohemian lifestyle, for which they\\'re well-known in their community, allows Jade and David to develop an all-consuming and passionate relationship, including allowing the two to have sex in Jade\\'s bedroom. In contrast to the openness of her family, David\\'s home life is dull; his parents are wealthy liberal political activists who have little interest in their son\\'s life.\\nOne night, Jade\\'s mother, Ann sneaks downstairs, and catches Jade and David making love by the fireplace. Ann starts living vicariously through them but her husband, Hugh, watches the couple with increasing unease. Jade\\'s nightly trysts begin to negatively impact her grades and her ability to sleep. One night, Jade tries to steal one of her father\\'s prescription sleeping pills but he catches her in the act. As a last straw, Hugh demands that David should stop seeing Jade, until the end of the school term. Although it initially causes a scene, Ann gently coaxes David to agree, telling him not to let Hugh \"do something he\\'ll regret\".\\nBack at school, one of David\\'s friends, Billy, tells him that when he was 8 years-old, he tried to burn a pile of newspapers, got scared and put the fire out, and his parents thought he was a hero for saving the house from burning. Inspired by this story, David starts a fire on the Butterfields\\' front porch and walks away. But by the time he returns, the flame has spread too far. David rushes to warn the family, but he is too late and the entire house is lost.\\nFollowing a trial, David is convicted of second-degree arson, sentenced to five years\\' probation, sent to a mental hospital for evaluation and forbidden to go anywhere near Jade or her family again. David continues to write to her daily, but the letters aren\\'t sent because of the no-contact order. His parents pull strings to have him released early, much to Hugh\\'s chagrin. Meanwhile, David receives his many letters upon his exit; realizing why Jade never wrote back, he decides to pursue her although he knows it violates his parole.\\nFollowing the loss of their home, the Butterfields have moved from Chicago to Manhattan where Ann and Hugh file for a divorce. In Manhattan, Ann tries to seduce David but he refuses, leaving her confused. When she isn\\'t looking, David thumbs through her address book to find out where Jade is and discovers that she now lives in Burlington and attends the University of Vermont. Intent on catching a bus to Vermont, David sees Hugh on the street. Hugh starts chasing him but is hit by a car and killed. Hugh\\'s new wife Ingrid catches up to the scene just in time to see David escape. David boards the bus to Vermont, but he is overcome with grief and returns to his apartment.\\nLater, Jade goes to David\\'s apartment to say goodbye but he pulls Jade back as she tries to leave, throwing her on the bed and forcefully holding her down until Jade admits she loves him. Keith comes home to find the pair together again and falsely informs Jade that David is at fault for their father\\'s death. Jade refuses to believe it at first but when David confirms that he was actually at the scene, she becomes horrified and hides behind Keith. David tries to explain it was an accident before he shoves Keith out of the way in a desperate bid to grab her. Keith fights him off until the police arrive and arrest David for brawling and disturbing the peace.\\nDavid is sentenced to prison and despairs that he\\'ll never see Jade again. At Hugh\\'s lakeside funeral, Jade tells Ann that nobody will ever love her like David does, although Ann speaks to her for understanding and approval. While in prison, David watches Jade walk toward him through his barred cell window.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nEndless Love is based on Scott Spencer\\'s 1979 novel of the same name. The film is directed by Franco Zeffirelli and written by Judith Rascoe. The film stars Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt in the two leading roles. It is also the film debut of Hewitt, Tom Cruise, Jami Gertz, Jeff Marcus and Ian Ziering. The film was shot in 1980 on location in Chicago, New York City and Long Island.\\nThe MPAA awarded the initial cut of Endless Love an X rating. Director Franco Zeffirelli subsequently made several cuts in the love scenes between Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt to achieve a lower rating. The film was re-submitted to the MPAA five times before they awarded it an R rating.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe film\\'s theme song, written by Lionel Richie and performed by Richie and Diana Ross and also called \"Endless Love\", became a number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and was the biggest-selling single in Ross\\' career. Billboard magazine chose it as \"The Best Duet of All Time\" in 2011, 30 years after its debut. It spent nine weeks at #1 and received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for \"Best Original Song\", along with five Grammy Award nominations. The soundtrack peaked at #9 on the Billboard Top 200 and was certified platinum. It also featured a second duet between Ross and Richie, \"Dreaming of You\", that received considerable airplay but was never released as a single.\\n\\nReception\\nThe film received mostly mixed reviews on release. Roger Ebert compared the film unfavorably with the novel, describing Martin Hewitt as miscast and criticizing the narrative, although he did praise Brooke Shields\\'s performance:Is there anything good in the movie? Yes. Brooke Shields is good. She is a great natural beauty, and she demonstrates, in a scene of tenderness and concern for Hewitt and in a scene of rage with her father, that she has a strong, unaffected screen acting manner. But the movie as a whole does not understand the particular strengths of the novel that inspired it, does not convince us it understands adolescent love, does not seem to know its characters very well, and is a narrative and logical mess.\\nJanet Maslin in The New York Times wrote:There are two sorts of people who\\'ll be going to see Endless Love — those who have read the richly imaginative novel on which the movie is based and those who have not. There will be dismay in the first camp, but it may be nothing beside the bewilderment in the second.\"\\nFilm historian Leonard Maltin seemed to agree, calling the film a \"textbook example of how to do everything wrong in a literary adaptation.\"In 2014, Scott Spencer, the author of the novel on which the film was based, wrote, \"I was frankly surprised that something so tepid and conventional could have been fashioned from my slightly unhinged novel about the glorious destructive violence of erotic obsession\". Spencer described the film as a \"botched\" job and wrote that Franco Zeffirelli \"egregiously and ridiculously misunderstood\" the novel.As of August 2019, Endless Love holds a rating of 28% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.\\n\\nRelease and box office\\nThe film premiere for Endless Love took place on July 16, 1981, at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City. The film was released the next day. Despite the poor critical reception, the film was a box office success. It made $4,163,623 on its opening weekend and went on to gross $31,184,024 in total, becoming the twenty-second highest earning film domestically in 1981. Internationally, the film took in a further $1,308,650 bringing its total worldwide gross to $32,492,674.\\n\\nAwards and recognition\\nKey honors\\nWinner: 1981 ASCAP Award, Lionel Richie, \"Endless Love\"\\nWinner: 1982 American Movie Award, Marquee Award, Lionel Richie, \"Endless Love\"\\nNominee: 1982 Academy Award for Best Original Song, Lionel Richie, \"Endless Love\"\\nNominee: 1982 Golden Globe Award, Best Original Song - Motion Picture, \"Endless Love\"\\nYoung Artist Awards\\nNominee: Best Young Motion Picture Actor - Martin Hewitt\\nNominee: Best Young Motion Picture Actress - Brooke Shields\\n1981 Golden Raspberry Awards\\nNominee: Worst Actress - Brooke Shields\\nNominee: Worst Director - Franco Zeffirelli\\nNominee: Worst New Star - Martin Hewitt\\nNominee: Worst Picture - Dyson Lovell\\nNominee: Worst Screenplay - Judith Rascoe\\nNominee: Worst Supporting Actress - Shirley Knight\\nAmerican Film Institute lists\\n100 Passions (2002) – Nominated\\n100 Songs (2004): \"Endless Love\" – Nominated\\n\\nSee also\\nEndless Love (2014 film)\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nEndless Love at IMDb\\nEndless Love at the TCM Movie Database\\nEndless Love at AllMovie\\nEndless Love at Box Office Mojo\\nEndless Love at Rotten Tomatoes',\n",
              " 'Entertainment Weekly': 'Entertainment Weekly (sometimes abbreviated as EW) is an American monthly entertainment magazine based in New York City, published by Meredith Corporation, that covers film, television, music, Broadway theatre, books, and popular culture. The magazine debuted on February 16, 1990, in New York City.\\nDifferent from celebrity-focused publications such as Us Weekly, People (a sister magazine to EW), and In Touch Weekly, EW primarily concentrates on entertainment media news and critical reviews. However, unlike Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, which are aimed at industry insiders, EW targets a more general audience.\\n\\nHistory\\nFormed as a sister magazine to People, the first issue of Entertainment Weekly was published on February 16, 1990.Created by Jeff Jarvis and founded by Michael Klingensmith, who served as publisher until October 1996, the magazine\\'s original television advertising soliciting pre-publication subscribers portrayed it as a consumer guide to popular culture, including movies, music, and book reviews, sometimes with video game and stage reviews, too. (\"the postmodern Farmers\\' Almanac\").In 1996, the magazine won the coveted National Magazine Award for General Excellence from the American Society of Magazine Editors. EW won the same award again in 2002.In September 2016, in collaboration with People, Entertainment Weekly launched the People/Entertainment Weekly Network. The network is \"a free, ad-supported, online-video network [that] carries short- and long-form programming covering celebrities, pop culture, lifestyle, and human-interest stories\". It was rebranded as PeopleTV in September 2017.Beginning with the August 2019 issue, Entertainment Weekly transitioned to a monthly issue model.Bruce Gersh, president of the Meredith entertainment division, which includes both EW and People, said that the cutback in print would be accompanied by deeper 24/7 digital coverage. Entertainment Weekly will still produce weekly digital \"covers\" and push into podcasts, and plans events and experiential offerings with stars and festivals.JD Heyman, deputy editor of People, replaced Henry Goldblatt as editor. About 15 people were cut as a result of the change. Previous owner Time Inc. spent $150 million developing EW after its February 1990 launch, and was rewarded for its patience when the magazine made a six-figure profit at the end of 1996, and in its peak years was cranking out $55 million in annual profit.Though still profitable before the switch to a monthly, it was squeezed in recent years as celebrity coverage exploded across all platforms and print advertising shrank. While still called a \"weekly\" before the switch, EW was publishing only 34 issues a year. Meredith considered selling the title along with several others after it completed its $2.8 billion acquisition of Time Inc., but was convinced to keep EW in part because it was so intertwined with top money-maker People.\\n\\nTypical content and frequency\\nThe magazine features celebrities on the cover and addresses topics such as television ratings, movie grosses, production costs, concert ticket sales, and advertising budgets, and in-depth articles about scheduling, producers, showrunners, etc.\\nThe magazine is published once per month, although the legacy name Entertainment \"Weekly\" is still used.\\n\\nLayout\\nEntertainment Weekly follows a typical magazine format by featuring a letters to the editor and table of contents in the first few pages, while also featuring advertisements. While many advertisements are unrelated to the entertainment industry, most ads are typically related to up-and-coming television, film, or music events.\\n\\nNews and notes\\nThese beginning articles open the magazine and as a rule focus on current events in pop culture. The whole section typically runs eight to ten pages long, and features short news articles and several specific recurring sections:\\n\\n\"Sound Bites\" usually opens the magazine. It is a collage of media personalities, actors, presenters, or comedians, alongside their recent memorable quotes in speech bubble form.\\n\"The Must List\" is a two-page spread highlighting 10 things (books, movies, songs, etc.) that the staff loves from the week; it usually features one pick from EW readers.\\n\"First Look\", subtitled \"An early peek at some of Hollywood\\'s coolest projects\", is a two-page spread with behind-the-scenes or publicity stills of upcoming movies, television episodes, or music events.\\n\"The Hit List\", written each week by critic Scott Brown, highlights 10 major events, with short comedic commentaries by Brown. Typically, some continuity to the commentaries exists. This column was originally written by Jim Mullen and featured 20 events each week, and Dalton Ross later wrote an abbreviated version.\\n\"The Hollywood Insider\" is a one-page section that reports breaking news in entertainment. It gives details, in the separate columns, on the most-current news in television, movies, and music.\\n\"The Style Report\" is a one-page section devoted to celebrity style. Because its focus is on celebrity fashion or lifestyle, it is graphically rich in nature, featuring many photographs or other images. The page converted to a new format: five pictures of celebrity fashions for the week, graded on the magazine\\'s review \"A\"-to-\"F\" scale (see Reviews section below). A spin-off section, \"Style Hunter\", which finds reader-requested articles of clothing or accessories that have appeared in pop culture recently, appears frequently.\\n\"The Monitor\" is a two-page spread devoted to major events in celebrity lives with small paragraphs highlighting events such as weddings, illnesses, arrests, court appearances, and deaths. Deaths of major celebrities are typically detailed in a one-half- or full-page obituary titled \"Legacy\". This feature is nearly identical to sister publication People\\'s \"Passages\" feature.\\nThe \"celebrity\" column, the final section of \"News and Notes\", is devoted to a different column each week, written by two of the magazine\\'s more-prominent writers:\\n\"The Final Cut\" is written by former executive editor and author Mark Harris. Harris\\' column focuses on analyzing current popular-culture events, and is generally the most serious of the columns. Harris has written about the writer\\'s strike and the 2008 presidential election, among other topics.\\n\"Binge Thinking\" was written by screenwriter Diablo Cody. After several profiles of Cody in the months leading up to and following the release of her debut film, Juno (2007), she was hired to write a column detailing her unique view of the entertainment business.\\nIf You Ask Me...\" Libby Gelman-Waxer (Paul Rudnick) was brought in to write his former Premiere column for Entertainment Weekly in 2011.\\n\\nFeature articles\\nTypically, four to six major articles (one to two pages each) fill the middle pages of the magazine. These articles are most commonly interviews, but  also it has narrative articles and lists. Feature articles tend to focus mostly on movies, music, and television and less on books and the theatre. In the magazine\\'s history, only  a few cover stories (e.g., John Grisham, Stephen King) were devoted to authors;  a cover has never been solely devoted to the theater.\\n\\nReviews\\nSeven sections of reviews are in the back pages of each issue (together encompassing up to one-half of the magazine\\'s pages). In addition to reviews, each reviews section has a top-sellers list, as well as numerous sidebars with interviews or small features. Unlike a number of European magazines that give their ratings with a number of stars (with normally 4 or 5 stars for the best review), EW grades the reviews academic-style, so that the highest reviews get a letter grade of \"A\" and the lowest reviews get an \"F\", with plus or minus graduations in between assigned to each letter except \"F\".\\nThe sections are:\\n\\n\"Movies\"\\nTypically, this section features all the major releases for that weekend, as well as several independent and foreign films that have also been released. Chris Nashawaty is the primary film critic. \"Critical Mass\"  was a table of the grades that have also been given by a number of noted movie reviewers in the American press (such as Ty Burr from The Boston Globe, Todd McCarthy from Variety, and Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times). Also eliminated from this section was the box-office figures from the previous weekend and some sort of infographics. The A+ rating is rarely awarded by EW. Two films to have received it are Citizen Kane and My Left Foot (1989). DVDs are now profiled in the one-page \"Movies on DVD\" section that follows. Longtime critic Lisa Schwarzbaum left the magazine in 2013, and critic Owen Gleiberman was let go after a round of layoffs in spring 2014. In 2015, it started publishing the scores of movies from Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb under \"Critical Mass.\"\"Television\"\\nThis section features reviews by critics Darren Franich and Kristen Baldwin for made-for-television films and new television programs or series, as well as some television specials. The section no longer includes the Nielsen ratings for the previous week. On the following page is typically a \"TV on DVD\" section, profiling releases of television films and specials or complete seasons of television shows. Current reviewers include Melissa Maerz.\"What to Watch\"\\nCurrently written by Ray Rahman, this features brief, one- or two-sentence reviews of several television programs on each night of the week, as well as one slightly longer review, usually written by someone else, with a letter grade.\"Music\"\\nThis section reviews major album releases for the week, divided by genre. Typically, at least one interview or feature is presented, as well as a section called \"Download This\", highlighting several singles available for download from the Internet.\"Books\"\\nThis section features reviews of books released during the week. Sometimes, authors write guest reviews of other works. Typically, one interview or spotlight feature is included in this section per issue. Bestseller lists appear at the end of this section.\"Theater\"*\\nReviews productions currently playing, listed by the city where they are running\"Games\"*\\nReviews current video game releases\"Tech\"*\\nReviews new websites and products, and profiles current Internet or technology phenomena*  Not in every issue.\\n\\nThe Bullseye\\nThis section occupies the back page of the magazine, rating the \"hits\" and \"misses\" from the past week\\'s events in popular culture on a bullseye graphic. For example, the May 22, 2009, edition featured Justin Timberlake hosting Saturday Night Live in the center, while the then-drama between Eminem and Mariah Carey missed the target completely for being \"very 2002\". At the time when this was printed on a small part of a page, events that were greatly disliked  were shown several pages away.\\n\\nSpecialty issues\\nEvery year, the magazine publishes several specialty issues. These issues were often published as double issues (running for two consecutive weeks). Many times these features were so long that they replaced all other feature articles.\\nCommon specialty issues include:\\n\\nSpring, Summer, Fall, and Winter Preview issues: Generally each quarter, the magazine reports on  upcoming releases in movies, music, television, live shows, and books. Typically, the summer issue\\'s focus is on upcoming movies only unless major television series or events, music releases, or book releases are occurring then.\\nThe Photo issue: Once a year, an issue is dedicated to featuring (aside from the normal reviews and news content) only photographs of celebrities. Unlike tabloid issues, these photographs are done with the celebrities\\' cooperation, and often they use some form of artistic expression. A wide variety of celebrities has been used, including Green Day, Reese Witherspoon, Morrissey, the cast of the television series Arrested Development, Tobey Maguire, and Cameron Diaz. Generally, the photographs  contain some descriptive text, sometimes about the person or sometimes a commentary from the photographers who photographed them for a story.\\nAcademy Awards issues: In the past, the magazine devoted at least four cover stories per year to the Academy Awards; \"The Oscar Race Begins\" issue in January predicted the nominees, the \"Nominees\" issue in February profiled the recently announced Oscar contenders, the \"Oscar Odds\" issue predicted the winners the week before the awards, and the \"After-Awards\" issue covered the ceremony the week after it airs. Virtually every issue mentioned the Oscars in some capacity, often on the cover, and a film or actor\\'s Academy Award chances were often noted in the magazine\\'s reviews. In comparison, music\\'s Grammy Awards, television\\'s Emmy Awards, and theater\\'s Tony Awards are given relatively limited coverage.\\nThe \"Must List\": A double-sized issue, it was usually timed for release in the last week of June. It focuses on what the magazine considers \"musts\" in entertainment with the latest hot movies, TV shows, music projects and novels along with previews of upcoming projects in those media that are gaining interest.\\nThe Fall TV Preview issue: Generally released in early September, this issue has the magazine detailing the upcoming fall season of both new and returning series.\\nEnd-of-the-Year issue: The last issue of each year, whose cover shows the \"Entertainer of the Year\" chosen by readers at EW\\'s official website. The issue features the ten-best releases in theater, film, television, music, DVD, literature and (as of last year) fashion that year. Music, television and film have two critics give their top ten; the others only have one. Each section also has a five-worst list (film is the only section in which both critics give the worst). Also in the issue are special sections devoted to the Entertainer of the Year, great performances, newly arrived stars, a timeline of infamous celebrity mishaps, and obituaries of stars who died (this used to be in a separate issue; it was combined with the \"end-of-the-year\" issue in 2003). This is the only issue without any reviews.The complete list of the annual \"Entertainer of the Year\" winners:\\n\\nThousandth issue and redesign\\nThe 1,000th issue was released July 4, 2008, and included the magazine\\'s top-100 list for movies, television shows, music videos, songs, Broadway shows, and technology of the past 25 years (1983–2008).\\nAs of its 1,001st issue, EW drastically revamped the look, feel, and content of the publication—increasing font and picture sizes and making all columns\\' word count shorter.\\n\\nWebsite\\nThe magazine\\'s website EW.com provides users with daily content, breaking news, blogs, TV recaps, original video programming, and entertainment exclusives and serves as an archive for past magazine interviews, columns, and photos. Along with a website, EW also has a radio station on Sirius XM.In April 2011, EW.com was ranked as the seventh-most-popular entertainment news property in the United States by comScore Media Metrix.\\n\\nPoppy Awards\\nPreviously named the EWwy Awards, the Poppy Awards were created by Entertainment Weekly to honor worthy series and actors not nominated for the Primetime Emmy Awards. The Poppys are awarded in 10 categories and no person nominated for an equivalent Primetime Emmy is eligible. Votes and nominations are cast online by anyone who chooses to participate.

              " 'Ethan Hunt': 'Ethan Matthew Hunt is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Mission: Impossible film series. He is portrayed by Tom Cruise in all films to date.\\n\\nAppearances\\nMission: Impossible (1996)\\nIn the first film, Hunt acts as the IMF point man for an experienced field team led by veteran Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), his mentor. While attempting to recover stolen files containing information on all IMF\\'s field agents during a mission in Prague, the entire team, barring Hunt, is supposedly killed and the files are stolen, leaving Hunt the only suspect as he learns that the mission was a set-up to expose a mole who had been selling secrets to a Czech arms dealer (Vanessa Redgrave). Hunt decides to steal the genuine list himself, demanding that the genuine mole be present at the exchange. He sets up a rogue team of other disavowed agents, including computer expert Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno), and Jim\\'s wife Claire (Emmanuelle Béart), who had in fact survived the mission and chooses to help Ethan clear his name. Ethan later finds Jim alive and deduces that he is the real mole, working with Claire and Krieger; Jim chose to betray the IMF due to his disillusionment with the end of the Cold War. He, Claire, and Krieger intend to escape with the money for the list and frame Ethan for their crimes. Ethan works out their true agenda when Jim attempts to accuse IMF head Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) of being the mole, allowing Ethan to expose their survival to Kittridge. In a final confrontation in the Channel Tunnel, Claire is killed when she tries to protect Ethan in a moment of conscience, and Ethan avenges the rest of the team when he kills Jim and Krieger by destroying their escape helicopter with explosive chewing gum from the Prague mission. Ethan gets Luther reinstated as an IMF agent and considers leaving the IMF, but is offered a mission of his own during the flight home.\\n\\nMission: Impossible 2 (2000)\\nIn the second film, Hunt is tasked with retrieving a deadly genetically engineered virus, known as \"Chimera\", from a rogue IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who intends to release the virus after acquiring a controlling influence on the company that created it so that he can profit from sales of the cure.  Hunt attempts to infiltrate Ambrose\\'s inner circle through Ambrose\\'s former girlfriend, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), an accomplished thief. During their mission, Hunt and Nordoff-Hall engage in an affair that complicates the mission. At the climax, Nordoff-Hall is forced to infect herself with the last virus in order to save Hunt; with Hunt having destroyed the only other traces of the virus, she was thus able to shield Hunt until he could escape. Subsequently racing against time—the virus is incurable twenty hours after infection—Hunt manages to acquire the cure and is forced to kill Ambrose.\\n\\nMission: Impossible III (2006)\\nIn the third film, Hunt is now a semi-retired training officer for IMF and plans a quiet life with his fiancée Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), who does not know about the IMF. He is called back into service to rescue a former student called Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) captured during a mission in Germany, and recovers confidential information via stolen laptop. He is forced to once again go rogue in an attempt to track down the sadistic arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and secure a dangerous mystery item known as the \\'Rabbit\\'s Foot\\'. After an impromptu ceremony, Hunt and Julia are married, only for Owen, who has a double agent working within IMF, to kidnap Julia. With the help of his IMF team: Stickell, Declan Gormley (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), and Zhen Lei (Maggie Q), Hunt finds the Rabbit\\'s foot, saves his wife, and kills Owen Davian in Shanghai.\\nThe later film Mission: Impossible – Fallout confirms that Ethan and Julia were happy for a while, but their marriage was tainted every time they heard a disaster due to the possibility that Ethan could have done something to stop it.\\n\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)\\nIn the fourth film, Hunt—having just escaped from a deep-cover mission in prison—and his IMF team are blamed for an attack that destroys the Kremlin, resulting in the disavowal of the entire IMF. Despite lacking their usual resources, connections, technology, and backup, their mission is to find and stop Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), a former Soviet nuclear strategist who is intent on starting a nuclear war to usher in the next era of human evolution. As they chase Hendricks to Dubai and on to Mumbai, India, they themselves are pursued by a team of Russian agents trying to apprehend them. The team becomes increasingly fractured as individual members fight their own demons while trying to trust the others. Hunt manages to pull the team together, stop a nuclear bomb and clear the IMF of any involvement in the Kremlin attack. It is also revealed that Hunt had Julia\\'s death faked to protect her, something only he and the Secretary of IMF knew about, giving him the pretext to infiltrate the prison his team freed him from in the opening scenes.\\n\\nMission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015)\\nIn the fifth film, Hunt is assigned a mission that culminates in him hanging outside of an A400M military aircraft 5,000 feet above the ground in Belarus to recover a package that contains VX nerve gas. Although this mission succeeds, when he learns that the thieves responsible for stealing the gas lacked the connections to do so, Hunt begins to uncover evidence of the existence of the Syndicate, a consortium of covert operatives who wreak terrorist attacks worldwide. After Hunt is forced to go off-the-grid when he is nearly killed by a Syndicate operative and the IMF is disbanded and absorbed into the CIA due to its controversial and destructive methods, he spends six months trying to track the Syndicate. Eventually, he and his former team learn that the Syndicate was actually originally a British project to perform missions without oversight, but British agent Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) took the plans and went rogue, now seeking to steal files that would grant him access to various established bank accounts to finance future Syndicate operations. Refusing to allow the Syndicate to continue, Hunt and his team are able to capture Lane, with CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) subsequently forced to claim that the disbanding of IMF was a cover to allow them to track the Syndicate.\\n\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout (2018)\\nIn the sixth film, an IMF mission goes wrong when Ethan chooses to save Luther after his friend is taken hostage, allowing a splinter group of the Syndicate, known as the Apostles, to gain access to three plutonium cores that could be used to create nuclear weapons. Forced to work with CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), Ethan is able to assume the identity of Apostle contact John Lark (Liang Yang) and acquire one of the cores in exchange for breaking Solomon Lane out of prison – despite opposition from Ilsa Faust, now under orders to kill Lane or bring him back to Britain – but he, Luther and Benji later use Lane to trick Walker into revealing that he is Lark. When the Secretary is killed by Walker, Ethan\\'s team and Ilsa track Walker and Lane to a medical aid camp where Julia, Ethan\\'s estranged wife, is currently working, Ethan realizing that Lane and Walker intend to detonate the bombs there for both the personal reason of hurting Ethan and the wider-scale reason that such a nuclear detonation would contaminate the water supply for almost a third of the world\\'s population. While Luther, Julia, Benji and Ilsa disable the bombs and confront Lane, Ethan is forced to steal a helicopter that he doesn\\'t know how to fly to pursue Walker and acquire the bomb detonator, culminating in a desperate struggle on a steep cliff that ends with Walker forced off the cliff. With the crisis concluded, Ethan\\'s reputation and the reputation of the IMF is redeemed in the eyes of the CIA, who muse that Ethan\\'s focus on individual lives is important for his superiors as it allows them to focus on the biggest picture.\\n\\nVideo games\\nAside from the Mission: Impossible films, Ethan Hunt has appeared in the 1998 video game based on the first film and the 2003 video game Mission: Impossible – Operation Surma, voiced by Steve Blum. He also appears as a playable character in the crossover game Lego Dimensions, with archive recordings of Tom Cruise being used for his voice.\\n\\nReception\\nAs of March 2020, Hunt was voted #31 on Ranker\\'s \"The Most Hardcore Big Screen Action Heroes\".Vlad Dima, writing in Bright Lights Film Journal, said while the series succeeds due to \"inventive, over-the-top stunts, the relentless trickery, and ultimately... Tom Cruise\\'s star-power\", he said, \"One less obvious element, though, is a myth that slowly develops over the span of the series and comes to full bloom in Fallout... [is Ethan] Hunt\\'s eternal quest... to become the perfect man.\" Dima said Ethan Hunt \"comes from a long line of action heroes\" and that the character (and the films) have become more like James Bond and Jason Bourne. Hunt \"erases all of the weaknesses we have ever noticed in any of these screen heroes\". He is unlike Bourne in knowing his status as \"a good guy\" and unlike Bond in not womanizing, having cared about only two women. Dima said, \"This personal detail seems to be an important requirement in the mythology of the perfect man.\"\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",
              " 'Eyes Wide Shut': 'Eyes Wide Shut is a 1999 erotic mystery psychological drama film directed, produced and co-written by Stanley Kubrick. Based on the 1926 novella Traumnovelle (Dream Story) by Arthur Schnitzler, the movie transfers the story from early 20th-century Vienna to 1990s New York City. The film follows the sexually charged adventures of Dr. Bill Harford, who is shocked when his wife, Alice, reveals that she had contemplated having an affair a year earlier. He then embarks on a night-long adventure, during which he infiltrates a massive masked orgy of an unnamed secret society.\\nKubrick obtained the filming rights for Dream Story in the 1960s, considering it a perfect text for a film adaptation about sexual relations. He revived the project in the 1990s when he hired writer Frederic Raphael to help him with the adaptation. The film, which was mostly shot in the United Kingdom, apart from some exterior establishing shots, includes a detailed recreation of exterior Greenwich Village street scenes made at Pinewood Studios. The film\\'s production, at 400 days, holds the Guinness World Record for the longest continuous film shoot.\\nKubrick died six days after showing his final cut to Warner Bros. Pictures, making this the final film he directed. In order to ensure a theatrical R rating in the United States, Warner Bros. digitally altered several sexually explicit scenes during post-production. This version was released on July 16, 1999, to moderately positive reactions from film critics. Box office receipts for the film worldwide were about $162 million. The uncut version has since been released in DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats.\\n\\nPlot\\nDoctors Bill and Alice Harford live in New York City with their daughter Helena. They attend a Christmas party hosted by wealthy patient Victor Ziegler, where Bill is reunited with Nick Nightingale, a medical school drop-out who now plays the piano professionally. An older Hungarian guest attempts to seduce Alice, and two young models attempt to seduce Bill. He is interrupted by his host, who had been having sex with Mandy, a young woman who has overdosed on a speedball. Mandy recovers with Bill\\'s aid.\\nThe following evening, while smoking marijuana, Alice and Bill discuss their episodes of unfulfilled temptation. Bill tells Alice he is not jealous of other men\\'s attraction to her because he deems women naturally inclined to fidelity. She then discloses that during their vacation on Cape Cod, she encountered a naval officer and fantasized about him enough to consider leaving Bill and their daughter. Bill is disturbed by Alice\\'s revelation before being called to the house of a patient who has just died. The patient\\'s distraught daughter, Marion, unsuccessfully tries to seduce Bill.\\nUpon leaving, he engages with a sex worker named Domino. Alice phones when they start kissing, prompting Bill to have a change of heart. He pays Domino for the sexless encounter and meets Nick at a jazz club. Nick describes an engagement where he must play piano blindfolded in events featuring beautiful women. Invitees require a costume, a mask and a password. Bill goes to a costume shop and offers the owner, Milich, a generous amount of money to rent a costume. Inside the shop, Milich is outraged when he catches his young daughter with two men.\\nBill takes a taxi to the country mansion mentioned by Nick. He gives the password and discovers a sexual ritual is taking place. One of the masked women warns him he is in terrible danger. Bill is ushered to a crowded room and unmasked by the master of ceremonies. The woman who had tried to warn Bill intervenes and insists on redeeming him, at an undisclosed personal cost. Bill is let off with a warning not to tell anyone about what happened.\\nBill arrives home guilty and confused. He finds Alice laughing in her sleep and awakens her. She tearfully explains a dream in which she was having sex with the naval officer and many other men, and laughing at the idea of Bill witnessing the scene. The next morning Bill goes to Nick\\'s hotel. The desk clerk explains that a bruised and frightened Nick checked out hours earlier escorted by two dangerous-looking men. Bill returns the costume but seems to have misplaced the mask, and learns that Milich has sold his teenage daughter into sex slavery.\\nBill heads to Domino\\'s apartment, apparently having decided to consummate his affair. However, he is greeted by a woman who claims she is Domino\\'s roommate Sally. There is obvious sexual tension between Bill and Sally but Sally then reveals that Domino had received just that morning the results of a test that indicated that she was HIV-positive. Bill leaves.\\nHaving left the apartment, Bill sees the news about a beauty queen\\'s death from an overdose, goes to the morgue, and identifies her as Mandy. He is then summoned by Ziegler, who reveals he was a guest in the orgy and identified Bill through his connection with Nick. Ziegler claims the secret society\\'s warnings are only intended to scare Bill from speaking about the orgy. However, he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats. Bill asks about Nick\\'s disappearance and Mandy\\'s death, correctly identifying her as the masked orgy participant who sacrificed herself for him. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back home in Seattle, and the punishment was part of the same charade of intimidation and had nothing to do with Mandy\\'s death. He also says that Mandy was an addict who had died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know whether Ziegler is telling the truth about Nick\\'s whereabouts or Mandy\\'s death.\\nUpon returning home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and tells Alice the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning, they go Christmas shopping with their daughter. Bill apologizes to Alice, and Alice muses that they should be grateful that their marriage and mutual love survived. She suggests that there is something they need to do \"as soon as possible.\" When Bill asks what, she simply responds, \"Fuck.\"\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nEyes Wide Shut developed after Stanley Kubrick read Arthur Schnitzler\\'s Dream Story in 1968, when Kubrick was looking for a project to follow 2001: A Space Odyssey. Kubrick was interested in adapting the story, and with the help of journalist Jay Cocks, bought the filming rights to the novel. In the 1970s, Kubrick thought of Woody Allen as the Jewish protagonist. For the following decade, Kubrick considered making the Dream Story adaptation a sex comedy \"with a wild and somber streak running through it\", starring Steve Martin in the main role. The project was revived in 1994 when Kubrick hired Frederic Raphael to work on the script, updating the setting from early 20th century Vienna to late 20th century New York City. Kubrick invited his friend Michael Herr, who helped write Full Metal Jacket, to make revisions, but Herr declined for fear he would be underpaid and have to commit to a long production.\\n\\nAdaptation\\nArthur Schnitzler\\'s 1926 novella Dream Story is set around Vienna after the turn of the century. The main characters are a couple named Fridolin and Albertina. The couple\\'s home is a typical suburban middle-class home. Like the protagonist of the novel, Schnitzler was Jewish, lived in Vienna, and was a medical doctor, although he left medicine to write.\\nKubrick frequently removed references to the Jewishness of characters in the novels he adapted. In Eyes Wide Shut, Frederic Raphael, who is Jewish, wanted to keep the Jewish background of the protagonists, but Kubrick disagreed and removed details that would identify characters as Jewish. Kubrick determined Bill should be a \"Harrison Ford-ish goy\" and created the surname of Harford as an allusion to the actor. In the film, Bill is taunted with homophobic slurs. In the novella, the taunters are members of an anti-Semitic college fraternity. In an introduction to a Penguin Classics edition of Dream Story, Raphael wrote that \"Fridolin is not declared to be a Jew, but his feelings of cowardice, for failing to challenge his aggressor, echo the uneasiness of Austrian Jews in the face of Gentile provocation.\"The novella is set during the Carnival, when people often wear masks to parties. The party that both husband and wife attend at the opening of the story is a Carnival Masquerade ball, whereas the film\\'s story begins at Christmas time.In the novella, the party (which is sparsely attended) uses \"Denmark\" as the password for entrance; that is significant in that Albertina had her infatuation with her soldier in Denmark; the film\\'s password is \"Fidelio\". In early drafts of the screenplay, the password was \"Fidelio Rainbow\". Jonathan Rosenbaum noted that both passwords echo elements of one member of the couple\\'s behaviour, though in opposite ways. The party in the novella consists mostly of nude ballroom dancing.\\nIn the novella, the woman who \"redeems\" Fridolin at the party, saving him from punishment, is costumed as a nun, and most of the characters at the party are dressed as nuns or monks; Fridolin himself used a monk costume. This aspect was retained in the film\\'s original screenplay, but was deleted in the filmed version.\\nThe novella makes it clear that Fridolin at this point hates Albertina more than ever, thinking they are now lying together \"like mortal enemies\". It has been argued that the dramatic climax of the novella is actually Albertina\\'s dream, and the film has shifted the focus to Bill\\'s visit to the secret society\\'s orgy, whose content is more shocking in the film.The adaptation created a character with no counterpart in the novella: Ziegler, who represents both the high wealth and prestige to which Bill Harford aspires, and a connection between Bill\\'s two worlds (his regular life, and the secret society organizing the ball). Critic Randy Rasmussen interprets Ziegler as representing Bill\\'s worst self, much as in other Kubrick films; the title character in Dr. Strangelove represents the worst of the American national security establishment, Charles Grady represents the worst of Jack Torrance in The Shining, and Clare Quilty represents the worst of Humbert Humbert in Lolita.More significantly, in the film, Ziegler gives a commentary on the whole story to Bill, including an explanation that the party incident, where Bill is apprehended, threatened, and ultimately redeemed by the woman\\'s sacrifice, was staged. Whether this is to be believed or not, it is an exposition of Ziegler\\'s view of the ways of the world as a member of the power elite.\\n\\nCasting\\nWhen Warner Bros. president Terry Semel approved production, he asked Kubrick to cast a movie star as \"you haven\\'t done that since Jack Nicholson [in The Shining]\". Cruise was in England because his wife Nicole Kidman was there shooting The Portrait of a Lady, and eventually Cruise decided to visit Kubrick\\'s estate with Kidman. After that meeting, the director awarded them the roles. Kubrick also managed to make both not commit to other projects until Eyes Wide Shut was completed. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Harvey Keitel each were cast and filmed by Kubrick. Due to scheduling conflicts, both had to drop out – first Keitel with Finding Graceland, then Leigh with eXistenZ – and they were replaced by Sydney Pollack and Marie Richardson in the final cut.In 2019, it was revealed that Cate Blanchett had provided the voice of the mysterious masked woman at the orgy party. Actress Abigail Good could not do a convincing American accent, and Cruise and Kidman ended up suggesting Blanchett for the dubbing, which occurred after Kubrick\\'s death.\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography began in November 1996. Kubrick\\'s perfectionism led to script pages being rewritten on the set with most scenes requiring numerous takes. The shoot went on for much longer than expected; the actress Vinessa Shaw was initially contracted for two weeks but ended up working for two months whilst the actor Alan Cumming who appears in one scene as a hotel clerk, auditioned six times before the filming process. Due to the relentless nature of the production, the crew became exhausted and were reported to have been impacted by low morale. Filming finally wrapped in June 1998. The Guinness World Records recognized Eyes Wide Shut as the longest constant movie shoot that ran \"...for over 15 months, a period that included an unbroken shoot of 46 weeks\".Given Kubrick\\'s fear of flying, the entire film was shot in England. Sound-stage works were completed at London\\'s Pinewood Studios which included a detailed recreation of Greenwich Village. Kubrick\\'s perfectionism went as far as sending workmen to Manhattan to measure street widths and note newspaper vending machine locations. Real New York footage was also shot to be rear projected behind Cruise. Production was followed by a strong campaign of secrecy helped by Kubrick always working with a short team on set. Outdoor locations included Hatton Garden for a Greenwich Village street, Hamleys for the toy store from the film\\'s ending, and Mentmore Towers and Elveden Hall in Elveden, Suffolk, England for the mansion. Larry Smith, who had first served as a gaffer on both Barry Lyndon and The Shining was chosen by Kubrick to be the film\\'s cinematographer. Wherever possible, Smith made use of available light sources visible in the shots such as lamps and Christmas tree lights, but when this was insufficient he used Chinese paper ball lamps to softly brighten the scene and/or other types of film lighting. The color was enhanced by push processing the film reels (emulsion) which helped bring out the intensity of the color.Kubrick\\'s perfectionism led him to oversee every visual element that would appear in a given frame, from props and furniture to the color of walls and other objects. One such element were the masks used in the orgy which were inspired by the masked carnival balls visited by the protagonists in the novel. Costume designer Marit Allen explained that Kubrick felt they fit in that scene for being part of the imaginary world and ended up \"creat[ing] the impression of menace, but without exaggeration\". As many masks as were used in the Venetian carnival were sent to London and Kubrick chose who would wear each piece. The paintings of Kubrick\\'s wife Christiane and his daughter Katherina are featured as decorations.After shooting had been completed, Kubrick entered a prolonged post-production process and on March 1, 1999 Kubrick showed a cut to Cruise, Kidman and the Warner Bros. executives. The director died six days later.\\n\\nMusic\\nJocelyn Pook wrote the original music for Eyes Wide Shut but, like other Kubrick movies, the film was noted for its use of classical music. The opening title music is Shostakovich\\'s Waltz No. 2 from \"Suite for Variety Stage Orchestra\", misidentified as \"Waltz 2 from Jazz Suite\". One recurring piece is the second movement of György Ligeti\\'s piano cycle \"Musica ricercata\". Kubrick originally intended to feature \"Im Treibhaus\" from Wagner\\'s Wesendonck Lieder, but the director eventually replaced it with Ligeti\\'s tune feeling Wagner\\'s song was \"too beautiful\". In the morgue scene, Franz Liszt\\'s late solo piano piece, \"Nuages Gris\" (\"Grey Clouds\") (1881), is heard. \"Rex tremendae\" from Mozart\\'s Requiem plays as Bill walks into the cafe and reads of Mandy\\'s death.Pook was hired after choreographer Yolande Snaith rehearsed the masked ball orgy scene using Pook\\'s composition \"Backwards Priests\" – which features a Romanian Orthodox Divine Liturgy recorded in a church in Baia Mare, played backwards – as a reference track. Kubrick then called the composer and asked if she had anything else \"weird\" like that song, which was reworked for the final cut of the scene, with the title \"Masked Ball\". Pook ended up composing and recording four pieces of music, many times based on her previous work, totaling 24 minutes. The composer\\'s work ended up having mostly string instruments – including a viola played by Pook herself – with no brass or woodwinds as Pook \"just couldn\\'t justify these other textures\", particularly as she wanted the tracks played on dialogue-heavy scenes to be \"subliminal\" and felt such instruments would be intrusive.Another track in the orgy, \"Migrations\", features a Tamil song sung by Manickam Yogeswaran, a Carnatic singer. The original cut featured a scriptural recitation from the Bhagavad Gita, which Pook took from a previous Yogeswaran recording. As a result of various fringe Hindu groups protesting against the scripture being used, Warner Bros. issued a public apology, and hired the singer to record a similar track to replace the chant.The party at Ziegler\\'s house features rearrangements of love songs such as \"When I Fall in Love\" and \"It Had to Be You\", used in increasingly ironic ways considering how Alice and Bill flirt with other people in the scene. As Kidman was nervous about doing nude scenes, Kubrick stated she could bring music to liven up. When Kidman brought a Chris Isaak CD, Kubrick approved it, and incorporated Isaak\\'s song \"Baby Did a Bad, Bad Thing\" to both an early romantic embrace of Bill and Alice and the film\\'s trailer.\\n\\nThemes and interpretations\\nGenre\\nThe film was described by some reviewers, and partially marketed, as an erotic thriller, a categorization disputed by others. It is classified as such in the book The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema, by Linda Ruth Williams, and was described as such in news articles about Cruise and Kidman\\'s lawsuit over assertions that they saw a sex therapist during filming. The positive review in Combustible Celluloid describes it as an erotic thriller upon first viewing, but actually a \"complex story about marriage and sexuality\". High-Def Digest also called it an erotic thriller.However, reviewing the film at AboutFilm.com, Carlo Cavagna regards this as a misleading classification, as does Leo Goldsmith, writing at notcoming.com, and the review on Blu-ray.com. Writing in TV Guide, Maitland McDonagh writes \"No one familiar with the cold precision of Kubrick\\'s work will be surprised that this isn\\'t the steamy erotic thriller a synopsis (or the ads) might suggest.\" Writing in general about the genre of \\'erotic thriller\\' for CineAction in 2001, Douglas Keesey states that \"whatever [Eyes Wide Shut\\'s] actual type, [it] was at least marketed as an erotic thriller\". Michael Koresky, writing in the 2006 issue of film journal Reverse Shot, writes \"this director, who defies expectations at every turn and brings genre to his feet, was  ... setting out to make neither the \\'erotic thriller\\' that the press maintained nor an easily identifiable \\'Kubrick film\\'\". DVD Talk similarly dissociates the film from this genre.\\n\\nChristmas setting\\nIn addition to relocating the story from Vienna in the 1900s to New York City in the 1990s, Kubrick changed the time-frame of Schnitzler\\'s story from Mardi Gras to Christmas. Michael Koresky believed Kubrick did this because of the rejuvenating symbolism of Christmas. Mario Falsetto, on the other hand, notes that Christmas lights allow Kubrick to employ some of his distinct methods of shooting including using source location lighting, as he also did in Barry Lyndon. The New York Times notes that the film \"gives an otherworldly radiance and personality to Christmas lights\", and critic Randy Rasmussen notes that \"colorful Christmas lights  ... illuminate almost every location in the film.\" Harper\\'s film critic, Lee Siegel, believes that the film\\'s recurring motif is the Christmas tree, because it symbolizes the way that \"Compared with the everyday reality of sex and emotion, our fantasies of gratification are  ... pompous and solemn in the extreme  ... For desire is like Christmas: it always promises more than it delivers.\" Author Tim Kreider notes that the \"Satanic\" mansion-party at Somerton is the only set in the film without a Christmas tree, stating that \"Almost every set is suffused with the dreamlike, hazy glow of colored lights and tinsel.\" Furthermore, he argues that \"Eyes Wide Shut, though it was released in summer, was the Christmas movie of 1999.\" Noting that Kubrick has shown viewers the dark side of Christmas consumerism, Louise Kaplan states that the film illustrates ways in which the \"material reality of money\" is shown replacing the spiritual values of Christmas, charity and compassion. While virtually every scene has a Christmas tree, there is \"no Christmas music or cheery Christmas spirit.\" Critic Alonso Duralde, in his book Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas, categorized the film as a \"Christmas movie for grownups\", arguing that \"Christmas weaves its way through the film from start to finish\".\\n\\nUse of Venetian masks\\nHistorians, travel guide authors, novelists, and merchants of Venetian masks have noted that these have a long history of being worn during promiscuous activities. Authors Tim Kreider and Thomas Nelson have linked the film\\'s usage of these to Venice\\'s reputation as a center of both eroticism and mercantilism. Nelson notes that the sex ritual combines elements of Venetian Carnival and Catholic rites, in particular, the character of \"Red Cloak\" who simultaneously serves as Grand Inquisitor and King of Carnival. As such, Nelson argues that the sex ritual is a symbolic mirror of the darker truth behind the façade of Victor Ziegler\\'s earlier Christmas party. Carolin Ruwe, in her book Symbols in Stanley Kubrick\\'s Movie \\'Eyes Wide Shut\\', argues that the mask is the prime symbol of the film. Its symbolic meaning is represented through its connection to the characters in the film; as Tim Kreider points out, this can be seen through the masks in the prostitute\\'s apartment and her being renamed as \"Domino\" in the film, which is a type of Venetian Mask. Unused early poster designs for the film by Kubrick\\'s daughter Katharina used the motif of Venetian masks, but were rejected by the studio because they obscured the faces of the film\\'s two stars.\\n\\nRelease\\nMarketing\\nWarner Bros. heavily promoted Eyes Wide Shut, while following Kubrick\\'s secrecy campaign – to the point that the film\\'s press kits contained no production notes, nor even the director\\'s suggestions to Semel regarding the marketing campaign, given one week prior to Kubrick\\'s death. The first footage was shown to theater owners attending the 1999 ShoWest convention in Las Vegas. TV spots featured both Isaak and Ligeti\\'s music from the soundtrack, while revealing little about the movie\\'s plot. The film also appeared on the cover of Time magazine, and on show business programs such as Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood.\\n\\nBox office\\nEyes Wide Shut opened on July 16, 1999, in the United States. The film topped the weekend box office, with $21.7 million from 2,411 screens. These numbers surpassed the studio\\'s expectations of $20 million, and became both Cruise\\'s sixth consecutive chart topper and Kubrick\\'s highest opening weekend as well as the highest featuring Kidman and Cruise together. Eyes Wide Shut ended up grossing a total of $55,691,208 in the US. The numbers put it as Kubrick\\'s second highest-grossing film in the country, behind 2001: A Space Odyssey, but were considered a box office disappointment.Shortly after its screening at the Venice Film Festival, Eyes Wide Shut had a British premiere on September 3, 1999, at the Warner Village cinema in Leicester Square. The film\\'s wide opening occurred the following weekend, and topped the UK charts with £1,189,672.The international performances for Eyes Wide Shut were more positive, with Kubrick\\'s long-time assistant and brother-in-law Jan Harlan stating that \"It was badly received in the Anglo-Saxon world, but it was very well received in the Latin world and Japan. In Italy, it was a huge hit.\" Overseas earnings of over $105 million led to a $162,091,208 box office run worldwide, turning it into the highest-grossing Kubrick film.\\n\\nReception\\nEyes Wide Shut received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 158 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Kubrick\\'s intense study of the human psyche yields an impressive cinematic work.\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 34 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Over 50 critics listed the film among the best of 1999. French magazine Cahiers du Cinema named it the best film of the year in its annual \"top ten\" list.In the Chicago Tribune, Michael Wilmington declared the film a masterpiece, lauding it as \"provocatively conceived, gorgeously shot and masterfully executed ... Kubrick\\'s brilliantly choreographed one-take scenes create a near-hypnotic atmosphere of commingled desire and dread.\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club was also highly positive, arguing that \"the film\\'s primal, almost religious intensity and power is primarily derived from its multifaceted realization that disobeying the dictates of society and your conscience can be both terrifying and exhilarating. ... The film\\'s depiction of sexual depravity and amorality could easily venture into the realm of camp in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, but Kubrick depicts primal evil in a way that somehow makes it seem both new and deeply terrifying.\"Critic Roger Ebert gave the film a positive 3.5/4 stars, writing, \"Kubrick\\'s great achievement in the film is to find and hold an odd, unsettling, sometimes erotic tone for the doctor\\'s strange encounters.\" He praised the individual dream-like atmosphere of the separate scenes, and called the choice of Christmas-themed lighting \"garish, like an urban sideshow\".Reviewer James Berardinelli stated that it was arguably one of Kubrick\\'s best films. Along with considering Kidman \"consistently excellent\", he wrote that Kubrick \"has something to say about the causes and effects of depersonalized sex\", and praised the work as \"thought-provoking and unsettling\". Writing for The New York Times, reviewer Janet Maslin commented, \"This is a dead-serious film about sexual yearnings, one that flirts with ridicule yet sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout. The dreamlike intensity of previous Kubrick visions is in full force here.\"Some reviewers were unfavorable. One complaint was that the movie\\'s pacing was too slow; while this may have been intended to convey a dream state, critics objected that it made actions and decisions seem laboured. Another complaint was that it did not live up to the expectation of it being a \"sexy film\" which is what it had been marketed as, thus defying audiences\\' expectations. Many critics, such as Manohla Dargis of LA Weekly found the prolific orgy scene to be \"banal\" and \"surprisingly tame\". While Kubrick\\'s \"pictorial talents\" were described as \"striking\" by Rod Dreher of the New York Post, the pivotal scene was deemed by Stephen Hunter, writing for The Washington Post, as the \"dullest orgy [he\\'d] ever seen\". Hunter elaborates on his criticism, and states that \"Kubrick is annoyingly offhand while at the same time grindingly pedantic; plot points are made over and over again, things are explained till the dawn threatens to break in the east, and the movie stumbles along at a glacial pace\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly complained about the inauthenticity of the New York setting, claiming that the soundstage used for the film\\'s production didn\\'t have \"enough bustle\" to capture the reality of New York. Paul Tatara of CNN described the film as a \"slow-motion morality tale full of hot female bodies and thoroughly uneventful \\'mystery\\'\", while Andrew Sarris writing for the New York Observer criticised the film\\'s \"feeble attempts at melodramatic tension and suspense\". David Edelstein of Slate dismissed it as \"estranged from any period I recognize. Who are these people played by Cruise and Kidman, who act as if no one has ever made a pass at them and are so deeply traumatized by their newfound knowledge of sexual fantasies—the kind that mainstream culture absorbed at least half a century ago? Who are these aristocrats whose limos take them to secret masked orgies in Long Island mansions? Even dream plays need some grounding in the real world.\" J. Hoberman wrote that the film \"feels like a rough draft at best.\"Lee Siegel from Harper\\'s felt that most critics responded mainly to the marketing campaign and did not address the film on its own terms. Others felt that American censorship took an esoteric film and made it even harder to understand. In his article \"Grotesque Caricature\", Stefan Mattesich of Loyola Marymount University praises the film\\'s nuanced caricatured elements, and states that the film\\'s negation of conventional narrative elements is what resulted in its subsequent negative reception.For the introduction to Michel Ciment\\'s Kubrick: The Definitive Edition, Martin Scorsese wrote: \"When Eyes Wide Shut came out a few months after Stanley Kubrick\\'s death in 1999, it was severely misunderstood, which came as no surprise. If you go back and look at the contemporary reactions to any Kubrick picture (except the earliest ones), you\\'ll see that all his films were initially misunderstood. Then, after five or ten years came the realization that 2001 or Barry Lyndon or The Shining was like nothing else before or since.\" In 2012, Slant Magazine ranked the film as the second greatest of the 1990s. The BBC listed it number 61 in its list of the 100 greatest American films of all time.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\nHome media\\nEyes Wide Shut was first released in VHS and DVD on March 7, 2000. The original DVD release corrects technical gaffes, including a reflected crew member, and altering a piece of Alice Harford\\'s dialogue. Most home videos remove the verse that was claimed to be cited from the sacred Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita (although it was Pook\\'s reworking of \"Backwards Priests\" as stated above.) In the UK, Warners\\' \\'rated 18\\' [no video altering] 1999 DVD release was in 4:3 full frame aspect ratio, with a note at the beginning that this was as Kubrick intended to be shown [ratio as shot]. However, the film\\'s length on this UK DVD is only 153 minutes, as opposed to the 159 minutes of other available DVD and Blu-Ray versions. This is due to the transfer being transferred at 25 f.p.s rather than 24 as shot; no actual footage was cut.\\nOn October 23, 2007, Warner Home Video released Eyes Wide Shut in a special edition DVD, plus the HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats. This is the first home video release that presents the film in anamorphic 1.78:1 (16:9) format (the film was shown theatrically as soft matted 1.66:1 in Europe and 1.85:1 in the US and Japan). The previous DVD release used a 1.33:1 (4:3) aspect ratio. It is also the first American home video release to feature the uncut version. Although the earliest American DVD of the uncut version states on the cover that it includes both the R-rated and unrated editions, in actuality only the unrated edition is on the DVD.\\n\\nControversies\\nDebate over the film\\'s state of completion\\nThough Warner Bros. insisted that Kubrick had turned in his final cut before his death, the film was still in the final stages of post-production, which was therefore completed by the studio in collaboration with Kubrick\\'s estate. Some have argued that the work which remained was minor and exclusively technical in nature, allowing the estate to faithfully complete the film based on the director\\'s notes. However, decisions regarding sound mixing, scoring and color-correction would have necessarily been made without Kubrick\\'s input. Furthermore, Kubrick had a history of continuing to edit his films up until the last minute, and in some cases even after initial public screenings, as had been the case with 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining.Writing for Vanity Fair, Kubrick collaborator Michael Herr recalled a phone call from the director regarding the cut that would be screened for the Warner Bros. executives four days before his death:\\n\\n... there was looping to be done and the music wasn\\'t finished, lots of small technical fixes on color and sound; would I show work that wasn\\'t finished? He had to show it to Tom and Nicole because they had to sign nudity releases, and to Terry Semel and Bob Daly of Warner Bros., but he hated it that he had to, and I could hear it in his voice that he did.\\nGarrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam, has expressed that he considers Eyes Wide Shut to be an unfinished film:\\n\\nI think Eyes Wide Shut was snatched up by the studio when Stanley died and they just grabbed the highest number Avid edit and ran off as if that was the movie. But it was three months before the movie was due to be released. I don\\'t think there\\'s a chance that was the movie he had in mind, or the music track and a lot of other things. It\\'s a great shame because you know it\\'s out there, but it doesn\\'t feel to me as it\\'s really his film.\\nNicole Kidman, one of the stars of the film, briefly wrote about the completion of the film and the release of the film being at the same time of John F. Kennedy Jr.\\'s death from her perspective:\\n\\nThere was a lot of interest in Eyes Wide Shut before it was released. But the weekend it came out, July 16, 1999, was the death of JFK Jr., his wife and her sister – a black, black weekend. And for Stanley to have died [on March 7, 1999, at age 70] before the film opened... Well, it all felt so dark and strange. Stanley had sent over the cut he considered done to us, Tom and I watched it in New York – and then he died.\\n\\nKubrick\\'s opinion\\nJan Harlan, Kubrick\\'s brother-in-law and executive producer, reported that Kubrick was \"very happy\" with the film and considered it to be his \"greatest contribution to the art of cinema\".R. Lee Ermey, an actor in Kubrick\\'s film Full Metal Jacket, stated that Kubrick phoned him two weeks before his death to express his despondency over Eyes Wide Shut. \"He told me it was a piece of shit\", Ermey said in Radar magazine, \"and that he was disgusted with it and that the critics were going to \\'have him for lunch\\'. He said Cruise and Kidman had their way with him – exactly the words he used.\"According to Todd Field, Kubrick\\'s friend and an actor in Eyes Wide Shut, Ermey\\'s claims do not accurately reflect Kubrick\\'s essential attitude. Field\\'s response appeared in an October 18, 2006 interview with Grouch Reviews:\\nThe polite thing would be to say \\'No comment\\'. But the truth is that  ... let\\'s put it this way, you\\'ve never seen two actors more completely subservient and prostrate themselves at the feet of a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn\\'t work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won\\'t get into because there is no reason to do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.\\nIn a reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session, Stanley Kubrick\\'s daughter, Katharina Kubrick, claimed that her father was very proud of the film. She also discredited Ermey\\'s claims, saying to a user who asked about Kubrick\\'s alleged comments, \"[not to] believe that for a second.\"\\n\\nStudio censorship and classification\\nCiting contractual obligations to deliver an R rating, Warner Bros. digitally altered the orgy for the film\\'s American release by blocking out graphic sexuality using additional figures to obscure the view in order to avoid an adults-only NC-17 rating that would have limited distribution, as some large American theaters and video store operators banned films with that rating. This alteration antagonized both film critics and cinephiles, who argued that Kubrick had never been shy about ratings (A Clockwork Orange was originally given an X-rating). The unrated version of Eyes Wide Shut was released in the United States on October 23, 2007, on DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray formats.\\nRoger Ebert heavily criticized the technique of using digital images to mask the action. In his positive review of the film, he said it \"should not have been done at all\" and it is \"symbolic of the moral hypocrisy of the rating system that it would force a great director to compromise his vision, while by the same process making his adult film more accessible to young viewers.\" Although Ebert has been frequently cited as calling the standard North American R-rated version the \"Austin Powers\" version of Eyes Wide Shut – referencing two scenes in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in which, through camera angles and coincidences, full frontal nudity is blocked from view in a comical way – his review stated that this joke referred to an early rough draft of the altered scene, never publicly released.\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nAdams, Mark (2004).

They include: Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kiefer Sutherland.\\nEach episode in season 1 begins with a cool and restrained jazz score as the sultry character Fay Friendly (Lynette Walden) explained to the audience what would develop in the episode. each episode in season 2 begins with a prologue voiced by Miguel Ferrer which explained to the audience the episode\\'s events and who the main characters were.Her words are wistful, melancholic and foreshadowed the pain to come.\\nNeo-noir novelist James Ellroy said of the show: \"It\\'s a roll call of tormented souls confronting their monsters within; it\\'s a picaresque look at Los Angeles back in the forties. It\\'s the world of pulp on celluloid, pure translations that augment the stark power of great short fiction.\"\\n\\nCrew\\nGuest stars\\nAmong the many guest stars on the show were:\\nFirst Season (1993)\\n\\nGary Oldman, Gabrielle Anwar, Dan Hedaya, Wayne Knight and Meg Tilly\\nTom Hanks, Marg Helgenberger, Jon Polito and Bruno Kirby\\nJoe Mantegna, Vinessa Shaw, Patrick Breen, J.E.

It lets us look over the edge and measure our souls against the darkness\". The Chicago Sun-Times gave the series two out of four stars and Ginny Holbert wrote, \"Part of the problem is the series\\' arch, self-conscious obsession with style. Instead of a \\'90s interpretation of film noir, \"Fallen Angels\" offers contrived, full-color cliche noir, replete with cocked fedoras, plumes of curling smoke and harsh sunlight sliced by venetian blinds\". In his review for The New York Times, John J. O\\'Connor called it, \"uneven but diverting, even when just hovering around film-school level\". In his review for the Houston Chronicle, Louis B. Parks wrote, \"The big problem with film noir homages is they usually overdo the ingredients, with none of the subtlety of the great originals. Fallen Angels has a touch of that. But the directors and actors play straight, and the adaptations, taken from the real McCoy writers, are pretty good stuff\". In his review for the Washington Post, Tom Shales wrote, \"Creating period pieces out of their period seems to be fairly easy now for the gifted artisans of Hollywood. Even by today\\'s commonplace high standards, however, the look and feel of the six Fallen Angels films seem transportingly authentic and sensuous, stylized in ways that evoke the milieu without spoofing it. Occasionally, the films veer into the arch and ridiculous, but overall, they at least look darn good\". Newsweek magazine\\'s David Gates wrote, \"no show this summer will do a better job of whisking you away from the increasingly unacceptable \\'90s. These half hours are all too short\". Entertainment Weekly magazine\\'s Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, \"One unintended result of all this happy, naughty cigarette-puffing, however, is that, at their weakest, these films look like the work of boys (and don\\'t be fooled, this is a boys\\' fantasy production) dressed up in their dads\\' big suits\".\\n\\nHome media\\nIn the United States the first season was released in a two volume VHS set.

              " 'Far and Away': 'Far and Away is a 1992 American epic Western romantic adventure drama film directed by Ron Howard from a script by Howard and Bob Dolman. It stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. This was the last cinematography credit for Mikael Salomon before he moved on to a directing career, and the music score was done by John Williams. It was screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.Cruise and Kidman play Irish immigrants seeking their fortune in 1890s America, eventually taking part in the Land Run of 1893.This was Cyril Cusack\\'s final film before his death the following year.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn Ireland in 1892, Joseph Donnelly\\'s father dies, but comes back to life for a few moments to tell Joseph to not give up his dream of owning his own land someday. His family home is burned down by his landlord Daniel Christie\\'s men because of unpaid rent. Joseph tries killing Daniel, but he injures himself in the process and is nursed back to health by Nora, Daniel\\'s wife, and her daughter, Shannon, intending to hang him after he heals from his injuries. Joseph meets Shannon, who plans to run away from home and travel to America, as there is land being given away for free there. She offers to take Joseph with her as her servant, because a woman can\\'t travel alone without being questioned. But he refuses so he can duel Christie\\'s foreman, Stephen Chase, who set fire to the Donnelly home. Christie meets Joseph before the duel and tells him that he had nothing do with Joseph\\'s family\\'s eviction because the land is managed by Chase. The duel begins, but Shannon rescues Joseph.\\nTogether on a ship bound for America, Shannon meets Mr. McGuire, who tells her and Joseph about free land being given away in Oklahoma, but they have to travel a thousand miles and race it like everyone else. Shannon divulges that her collection of silver spoons will cover all expenses to get them to Oklahoma, and McGuire offers to help her find a shop to sell them to once they arrive. Upon arriving, McGuire is shot, and Shannon\\'s spoons fall out of his clothing which are stolen by passersby. Joseph rescues her but not the spoons. Soon they are introduced to Mike Kelly, a Boston ward boss, and an Irish immigrant himself. Kelly finds Joseph and Shannon jobs and a room to rent in a brothel, which they must share. To avoid scandal, Joseph says that Shannon is his sister. As they share the room, Joseph and Shannon become attracted to each other. Joseph becomes a regular in bare-knuckle boxing matches at Boss Kelly\\'s club to make extra cash. Back in Ireland, the Christies\\' house is burned down by angry tenants in the Irish Land War, so they emigrate to America.\\nJoseph discovers that Shannon has gone to Kelly\\'s club to dance burlesque. The Irish men surrounding the couple beg him to fight for $200, which would get them to Oklahoma. Joseph agrees and is winning until he notices one of his backers groping Shannon. Joseph pushes through the crowd to free her, but is pushed back into the ring where his foot accidentally \"toes\" the line, and he is defeated by a sucker punch. In retaliation for the hundreds of dollars Joseph has cost Kelly and his friends, Joseph is thrown out of the club. Joseph returns to their room in the brothel to find Kelly and his thugs taking the money he and Shannon saved, and Joseph and Shannon are thrown out into the streets, homeless.\\nCold and famished, the pair stay in a seemingly abandoned and luxurious house. The owners of the house return and chase them away, shooting Shannon in the back. Joseph, knowing the Christies are looking for her in Boston, brings Shannon to the home where they\\'re staying. Deciding Shannon will be better cared for by them, Joseph leaves, despite his obvious feelings for her. Joseph heads west to the Ozarks, and finds work laying train track. He sees a wagon train out the door of his boxcar. Knowing it is headed for the Oklahoma land rush, Joseph abandons the railroad and joins the wagon train, arriving in time for the Land Run of 1893.\\nJoseph finds Shannon, Chase, and the Christies already in Oklahoma. Chase, having seen Joseph talking to Shannon, threatens to kill him if he goes near Shannon again. Joseph buys a horse for the land rush, but it dies in a few hours, and is forced to ride an unruly horse he manages to tame. He discovers that Chase has cheated by illegally inspecting the territory before the race, and is headed for the extremely desirable land he found. Joseph quickly outpaces everybody and catches up with Shannon and Chase.  Joseph is ready to plant his claim flag, but Chase rushes on horseback at Joseph. A fight breaks out, with Joseph falling and crushed by the horse. Shannon runs to his side and rejects Chase when he questions her actions. Joseph professes his love for Shannon and dies in her arms, but like his father, comes back to life fully revived when Shannon reciprocates Joseph\\'s love. They both drive the land stake into the ground and claim their prize land together.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nPre-production began in late April 1991. The film was shot in Montana for business reasons, but the Oklahoma Historical Society was involved in its production. Imagine Production Co. toured the areas around Montana for a week. They visited different areas before selecting Billings, Montana.  Ron Howard, whose film Backdraft was in the stages of being released in theatres at the time, arrived in Billings to begin groundwork for the film. One site outside of town was a 12,000-acre ranch, which was going to be used to film the Oklahoma Land Rush scene. More than a hundred extras were used, as well as a dozen area actors for small speaking parts. Working titles for the film included The Irish Story and An Irish Story.Principal photography began in Montana on May 28, 1991. After several weeks of preparation, the cast and crew filmed the Oklahoma Land Rush scene on July 7, 1991. Eight hundred riders and extras, nine hundred horses, mule, oxen, and two hundred wagons were used on a quarter mile wide set. Nine cameras were used to film the action sequences. During the filming of the scene four people broke bones and one horse died.  Cruise\\'s boxing match was filmed at the Billings Depot. Local area residents were used as extras for the sequence. American Humane reported that \"The production company not only met American Humane\\'s Guidelines, but went that extra mile to ensure both the physical and mental well-being of the animals.\"\\nAfter filming wrapped in Billings, the cast and crew traveled to Dublin, Ireland, to complete filming. Ardmore Studios in Wicklow was used to film interior sequences, and the streets of Boston were filmed in Dublin city. They spent two months there, and production was completed on September 26, 1991.It was the first film shot in Panavision Super 70 and the first film to be shot in 70mm in a decade since Tron (1982). The Arriflex 765 camera was also used, as the camera was capable of 100 frames per second which was used for slow-motion shots during the Oklahoma land rush scene.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe music to Far and Away was composed and conducted by composer John Williams.  The score, a mixture of traditional Irish instrumentation and conventional orchestra, prominently featured performances by the Irish musical group The Chieftains and a revision of the song \"Book of Days\" composed and performed by Enya.  The soundtrack was released 26 May 1992 through MCA Records and features 19 tracks of music at a running time just over sixty-seven minutes.

It\\'s depressing that such a lavish and expensive production, starring an important actor like Tom Cruise, could be devoted to such a shallow story.\\nTodd McCarthy of Variety called it \"handsomely mounted and amiably performed but leisurely and without much dramatic urgency.\"Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote: \"Far and Away... is the director\\'s attempt to step into the cinematic shoes of directors John Ford and David Lean. And, certainly, he\\'s stepped into something with this sprawling, old-fashioned melodrama.\"Writer Tony Parsons called it \"a stinker of a picture...which was far and away the worst film I have ever seen.\"\\nThe film was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song for the song \"Book of Days\".\\n\\nTelecast\\nFor its airing on ABC in 1996, the network had reinstated 35 minutes of deleted scenes to fit two hour blocks in two days.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nFar and Away at IMDb\\nFar and Away at the TCM Movie Database\\nFar and Away at TomCruise.com\\nFar and Away at AllMovie\\nFar and Away at Box Office Mojo\\nFar and Away at Rotten Tomatoes',\n",
              " 'Financial Times': 'The Financial Times (FT) is a British daily newspaper printed in broadsheet and published digitally that focuses on business and economic current affairs. Based in London, England, the paper is owned by the Japanese holding company, Nikkei, with core editorial offices across Britain, the United States, and continental Europe. In July 2015, Pearson sold the publication to Nikkei for £844 million (US$1.32 billion) after owning it since 1957. In Spring 2019, it reported one million paying subscriptions, three-quarters of which are digital subscriptions. The newspaper has a prominent focus on financial journalism and economic analysis over generalist reporting, drawing both criticism and acclaim. The daily sponsors an annual book award and publishes a \"Person of the Year\" feature.\\nThe paper was founded in 1888 as the London Financial Guide before rebranding a year later as the Financial Times. It was first circulated around metropolitan London by James Sheridan, who, along with his brother and Horatio Bottomley, sought to report on city business opposite the Financial News. The succeeding half-century competition between the two papers would eventually culminate in a 1945 merger, led by Brendan Bracken, which established it as one of the largest business newspapers in the world. Globalisation from the late-19th to mid-20th century facilitated editorial expansion for the FT, with the paper adding opinion columns, special reports, political cartoons, reader letters, book reviews, technology articles, and global politics features. The paper is often recognisable by its light-pink (salmon) broadsheet and digital display. It is supplemented by its lifestyle magazine (FT Magazine), weekend edition (FT Weekend), and a small portfolio of industry publications.\\nThe editorial stance of the Financial Times centres on economic liberalism, particularly free trade and free markets. Since its founding it has supported liberal democracy, favouring classically liberal politics and policies from international governments. Its newsroom is independent from its editorial board. Due to its history of economic commentary, the FT publishes a variety of financial indices, primarily the FTSE All-Share Index. Its typical depth of coverage has, since the late-20th century, linked the paper with a white-collar and educated readership. The Financial Times is headquartered in Bracken House at 10 Cannon Street, near the city\\'s financial centre, where it maintains its publishing house, corporate centre, and main editorial office.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe FT was launched as the London Financial Guide on 10 January 1888, renaming itself the Financial Times on 13 February the same year. Describing itself as the friend of \"The Honest Financier, the Bona Fide Investor, the Respectable Broker, the Genuine Director, and the Legitimate Speculator\", it was a four-page journal. The readership was the financial community of the City of London, its only rival being the more daring and slightly older (founded in 1884) Financial News. On 2 January 1893 the FT began printing on light pink paper to distinguish it from the similarly named Financial News: at the time it was also cheaper to print on unbleached paper (several other more general newspapers, such as The Sporting Times, had the same policy), but nowadays it is more expensive as the paper has to be dyed specially.After 57 years of rivalry the Financial Times and the Financial News were merged in 1945 by Brendan Bracken to form a single six-page newspaper. The Financial Times brought a higher circulation while the Financial News provided much of the editorial talent. The Lex column was also introduced from Financial News. Pearson\\nGordon Newton, a Cambridge graduate, took over as Editor in 1949, and immediately introduced a policy (then most unusual in Fleet Street) of direct recuitment of new university graduates, mainly from Oxbridge, as its trainee journalists. Many of them proceeded to have distinguished careers elsewhere in journalism and British public life, and became the mainstay of the paper\\'s own editorial strengths until the 1990s. The first such \\'direct recruit\\' was (the future leading British economist) Andrew Shonfield; the second was (later Sir) William Rees-Mogg who went on, via The Sunday Times, to edit The Times in 1967 following its acquisition by Roy Thomson. Other FT Oxbridge recruits included the future Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. The FT\\'s distinctive recruitment policy for Fleet Street journalists was never popular with the National Union of Journalists and ceased in 1966 following the recruitment of Richard Lambert from Oxford, himself a future Editor of the FT. Meanwhile Pearson had bought the paper in 1957. Over the years the paper grew in size, readership and breadth of coverage. It established correspondents in cities around the world, reflecting a renewed impetus in the world economy towards globalisation. As cross-border trade and capital flows increased during the 1970s, the FT began international expansion, facilitated by developments in technology and the growing acceptance of English as the international language of business. On 1 January 1979 the first FT (Continental Europe edition) was printed outside the UK, in Frankfurt. Since then, with increased international coverage, the FT has become a global newspaper, printed in 22 locations with five international editions to serve the UK, continental Europe, the U.S., Asia and the Middle East.The European edition is distributed in continental Europe and Africa. It is printed Monday to Saturday at five centres across Europe, reporting on matters concerning the European Union, the euro and European corporate affairs. In 1994 FT launched a luxury lifestyle magazine, How To Spend It. In 2009 it launched a standalone website for the magazine. On 13 May 1995 the Financial Times group made its first foray into the online world with the launch of FT.com. This provided a summary of news from around the globe, which was supplemented in February 1996 with stock price coverage. The second-generation site was launched in spring 1996. The site was funded by advertising and contributed to the online advertising market in the UK in the late 1990s. Between 1997 and 2000 the site underwent several revamps and changes of strategy, as the FT Group and Pearson reacted to changes online. FT introduced subscription services in 2002. FT.com is one of the few UK news sites successfully funded by individual subscription.\\nIn 1997 the FT launched a U.S. edition, printed in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Orlando and Washington, D.C., although the newspaper was first printed outside New York City in 1985. In September 1998 the FT became the first UK-based newspaper to sell more copies internationally than within the UK. In 2000 the Financial Times started publishing a German-language edition, Financial Times Deutschland, with a news and editorial team based in Hamburg. Its initial circulation in 2003 was 90,000. It was originally a joint venture with a German publishing firm, Gruner + Jahr. In January 2008 the FT sold its 50% stake to its German partner. FT Deutschland never made a profit and is said to have accumulated losses of €250 million over 12 years. It closed on 7 December 2012. The Financial Times launched a new weekly supplement for the fund management industry on 4 February 2002. FT fund management (FTfm) was and still is distributed with the paper every Monday. FTfm is the world\\'s largest-circulation fund management title. Since 2005 the FT has sponsored the annual \\'\\'Financial Times\\'\\' and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award.\\n\\nOn 23 April 2007 the FT unveiled a \"refreshed\" version of the newspaper and introduced a new slogan, \"We Live in Financial Times.\" In 2007 the FT pioneered a metered paywall, which let visitors to its website read a limited number of free articles during any one month before asking them to pay. Four years later the FT launched its HTML5 mobile internet app. Smartphones and tablets now drive 12% of subscriptions and 19% of traffic to FT.com. In 2012 the number of digital subscribers surpassed the circulation of the newspaper for the first time and the FT drew almost half of its revenue from subscriptions rather than advertising.The FT has been available on Bloomberg Terminal since 2010 and on the Wisers platform since 2013. From 2015, instead of the metered paywall on the website, visitors were given unlimited free access for one month, after which they needed to subscribe. Pearson sold the Financial Times Group to Nikkei, Inc. for £844 million (US$1.32 billion) in July 2015. In 2016, the Financial Times acquired a controlling stake in Alpha Grid, a London-based media company specialising in the development and production of quality branded content across a range of channels, including broadcast, video, digital, social and events. In 2018, the Financial Times acquired a controlling stake in Longitude, a specialist provider of thought leadership and research services to a multinational corporate and institutional client base. This investment built on the Financial Times’s recent growth in several business areas, including branded content via the acquisition of Alpha Grid, and conferences and events through Financial Times Live and extends the FT\\'s traditional commercial offering into a wider set of integrated services. In 2020, reporter Mark Di Stefano resigned from the Financial Times after hacking into Zoom calls at other media organisations including The Independent and the Evening Standard.\\n\\nWirecard exposé\\nIn January 2019, the FT began a series of investigative articles detailing fraud suspicions at German payments group Wirecard. When the Wirecard share price plunged, German news media speculated that market manipulation was behind this attack on a German corporate, focusing on the lead author of the FT series, Dan McCrum. The Public prosecutor\\'s office in Munich subsequently launched an investigation. After the formal complaint of an investor, Wirecard and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) the responsible state\\'s attorney announced investigations into several FT journalists.On 22 June 2020 and after 18 months of investigations and an external audit, Wirecard announced that €1.9 billion worth of cash reported in its accounts \"may not exist\". The company subsequently filed for insolvency. BaFin itself became subject of a European Securities and Markets Authority investigation for its response to the scandal.\\n\\nAudience\\nAccording to the Global Capital Markets Survey, which measures readership habits amongst most senior financial decision makers in the world\\'s largest financial institutions, the Financial Times is considered the most important business read, reaching 36% of the sample population, 11% more than The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), its main rival. The Economist, which was once 50% owned by FT, reaches 32%. FT\\'s The Banker also proved vital reading, reaching 24%. In addition FT was regarded as the most credible publication in reporting financial and economic issues among the Worldwide Professional Investment Community audience. The Economist was also rated the third most credible title by most influential professional investors (those who personally managed asset funds worth $5 billion or more), while the WSJ was second.\\n\\nContent\\nThe FT is split into two sections. The first section covers domestic and international news, editorial commentary on politics and economics from FT journalists such as Martin Wolf, Gillian Tett and Edward Luce, and opinion pieces from globally renowned leaders, policymakers, academics and commentators. The second section consists of financial data and news about companies and markets. Despite being generally regarded as primarily a financial newspaper, it does also contain TV listings, weather and other more informal articles. About 110 of its 475 journalists are outside the United Kingdom.\\n\\nThe Lex column\\nThe Lex column is a daily feature on the back page of the first section. It features analyses and opinions covering global economics and finance. The FT calls Lex its agenda-setting column. The column first appeared on Monday, 1 October 1945. The name may originally have stood for Lex Mercatoria, a Latin expression meaning literally \"merchant law\". It was conceived by Hargreaves Parkinson for the Financial News in the 1930s and moved to the Financial Times when the two merged.\\nLex boasts some distinguished alumni who have gone on to make careers in business and government – including Nigel Lawson (former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer), Richard Lambert (CBI director and former member of the Bank of England\\'s monetary policy committee), Martin Taylor (former chief executive of Barclays), John Makinson (chairman and chief executive of Penguin), John Gardiner (former chairman of Tesco), David Freud (former UBS banker and Labour adviser, now a Conservative peer), John Kingman (former head of UKFI and a banker at Rothschild\\'s), George Graham (RBS banker), Andrew Balls (head of European portfolio management at PIMCO) and Jo Johnson (former Conservative Member of Parliament for Orpington).\\n\\nFT Weekend\\nThe FT publishes a Saturday edition of the newspaper called the Financial Times Weekend. It consists of international economic and political news, Companies & Markets, Life & Arts, House & Home and FT Magazine.\\n\\nHow to Spend It\\nHow to Spend It is a monthly magazine published with FT Weekend. Founded and launched by Julia Carrick with Lucia van der Post as founding editor, its articles concern luxury goods such as yachts, mansions, apartments, horlogerie, haute couture and automobiles, as well as fashion and columns by individuals in the arts, gardening, food, and hotel and travel industries. How to Spend It started in 1967 as a one-page consumer goods feature in the newspaper, which was edited by Sheila Black, a former actor and FT’s first female journalist. To celebrate its 15th anniversary, FT launched the online version of this publication on 3 October 2009.Some media commentators were taken aback by the online launch of a website supporting conspicuous consumption during the financial austerity of the late-2000s recession. The magazine has been derided in rival publishers\\' blogs, as \"repellent\" in the Telegraph and \"a latter-day Ab Fab manual\" in the Guardian. A \\'well-thumbed\\' copy of the supplement was found when rebel forces broke into Colonel Gaddafi\\'s Tripoli compound during the 2011 Libyan Civil War.\\n\\nEditorial stance\\nThe FT advocates free markets and is in favour of globalisation, as well as globalist policies. During the 1980s it supported Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan\\'s monetarist policies. It has supported the UK Labour Party in the past, including at the general election in 1992 when Neil Kinnock was Labour leader. The FT\\'s editorials tend to be pro-European, supporting the European Union (including Britain\\'s membership thereof) in the context of a common economic market and opposing political integration. The FT was firmly opposed to the Iraq War.In the general election in the UK in 2010 the FT was receptive to the Liberal Democrats\\' positions on civil liberties and political reform, and praised the then Labour leader Gordon Brown for his response to the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, but on balance it backed the Conservatives while questioning their tendency to Euroscepticism. At the subsequent general election in 2015, the FT called for the continuation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition that had governed for the previous five years.In the 2017 UK general election a Financial Times editorial reluctantly backed Theresa May (Conservative Party) over Jeremy Corbyn (Labour Party) while warning about her stance on immigration and the eurosceptic elements in her party.The modern FT is a product of a merger of two smaller newspapers in 1945, since that time, the paper had backed the Conservatives fairly consistently, however, Labour\\'s tacking to the Centre combined with the Conservatives embracement of Euroscepticism led the FT to reverse course and back Labour from 1992 till 2010, when the FT returned the Conservative party. However, euroscepticism would further drive a wedge between the FT and the Conservatives in 2019, where the paper refused to make an endorsement, appalled at Labour\\'s socialist economic policies and the Conservatives commitment to a Hard Brexit.\\n\\nU.S. politics\\nIn the U.S. presidential election in 2008 the Financial Times endorsed Barack Obama. While it raised concerns over hints of protectionism, it praised his ability to \"engage the country\\'s attention,\" his calls for a bipartisan politics, and his plans for \"comprehensive health-care reform\". The FT favoured Obama again in 2012. The FT endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\\n\\nOwnership and related publications\\nOn 23 July 2015, Nikkei, Inc. agreed to buy the Financial Times Group, a division of Pearson PLC since 1957, for £844m ($1.32 billion) and the acquisition was completed on 30 November 2015. Until August 2015 the FT group had a 50% shareholding in The Economist, which was sold to the Agnelli family for £469 million. Related publications include the Financial Times, FT.com, FT Search Inc., the publishing imprint FT Press and numerous joint ventures. In November 2013 it agreed to sell Mergermarket, an online intelligence reporting business, to the London private equity investor BC Partners. In addition, the FT Group has a unit called FT Specialist, which is a provider of specialist information on retail, personal and institutional finance segments. It publishes The Banker, Money Management and Financial Adviser (a publication targeted at professional advisers), fDi Intelligence and Professional Wealth Management (PWM).The Financial Times Group announced the beta launch of newssift, part of FT Search, in March 2009. Newssift.com is a next-generation search tool for business professionals that indexes millions of articles from thousands of global business news sources, not just the FT. The Financial Times Group acquired Money Media (an online news and commentary site for the industry) and Exec-Appointments (an online recruitment specialist site for the executive jobs market). The FT Group once had a 13.85% stake in Business Standard Ltd of India, the publisher of the Business Standard. It sold this stake in April 2008 and has entered into an agreement with Network 18 to launch the Financial Times in India, though it is speculated that they may find it difficult to do so, as the brand \\'Financial Times\\' in India is owned by The Times Group, the publisher of The Times of India and The Economic Times. The group also publishes America\\'s Intelligence Wire, a daily general newswire service.The Financial Times\\' Financial Publishing division (formerly FT Business) provides print and online content for retail, personal and institutional finance audiences.  Examples of publications and services include: Investors Chronicle, a personal finance magazine and website; \"FT Money\", a weekly personal finance supplement in \"FT Weekend\"; FT Wealth, a magazine for the global high-net-worth community and FTfm, a weekly review of the global fund management industry, Money Management and Financial Adviser (a publication targeted at professional advisers). The institutional segment includes: The Banker,  This Is Africa, fDi Intelligence and Professional Wealth Management (PWM). Money-Media, a separate arm of Financial Publishing, delivers a range of digital information services for fund management professionals around the globe, including: Ignites, Ignites Europe, Ignites Asia, FundFire and BoardIQ. Financial Publishing includes publications (Pensions Expert and Deutsche Pensions & Investmentnachrichten) and events (Investment Expert) for the European pensions industry. The group also publishes MandateWire, a financial information company that provides sales and market intelligence for investment professionals in North America, Europe and Asia.FT Knowledge is an associated company which offers educational products and services. FT Knowledge has offered the \"Introducing the City\" course (which is a series of Wednesday night lectures and seminars, as well as weekend events) during each autumn and spring since 2000. FT Predict is a prediction market contest hosted by the Financial Times that allows users to buy and sell contracts based on future financial, political, and news-driven events by spending fictional Financial Times Dollars (FT$). Based on the assumptions displayed in James Surowiecki\\'s The Wisdom of Crowds, this contest allows people to use prediction markets to observe future occurrences while competing for weekly and monthly prizes.\\nThe Financial Times also ran a business-related game called \"In the Pink\" (a phrase meaning \"in good health\", also a reference to the colour of the newspaper and to the phrase \"in the red\" meaning to be making a loss). Each player was put in the virtual role of Chief Executive and the goal was to have the highest profit when the game closes. The winner of the game (the player who makes the highest profit) was to receive a real monetary prize of £10,000. The game ran from 1 May to 28 June 2006.\\n\\nIndices\\nThe Financial Times collates and publishes a number of financial market indices, which reflect the changing value of their constituent parts. The longest-running of these was the former Financial News Index, started on 1 July 1935 by the Financial News. The FT published a similar index; this was replaced by the Financial News Index—which was then renamed the Financial Times (FT) Index—on 1 January 1947. The index started as an index of industrial shares, and companies with dominant overseas interests were excluded, such as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later BP), British-American Tobacco, Lever Brothers (later Unilever) and Shell. The oil and financial sectors were included decades later.The FTSE All-Share Index, the first of the FTSE series of indices, was created in 1962, comprising the largest 594 UK companies by market capitalisation. The letters F-T-S-E represented that FTSE was a joint venture between the Financial Times (F-T) and the London Stock Exchange (S-E). On 13 February 1984 the FTSE 100 was introduced, representing about eighty percent of the London Stock Exchange\\'s value. In 1995 FTSE Group was made an independent company. The first of several overseas offices was opened in New York City in 1999; Paris followed in early 2000, Hong Kong, Frankfurt and San Francisco in 2001, Madrid in 2002 and Tokyo in 2003.\\nOther well-known FTSE indices include the FTSE 350 Index, the FTSE SmallCap Index, the FTSE AIM UK 50 Index and FTSE AIM 100 Index as well as the FTSE AIM All-Share Index for stocks, and the FTSE UK Gilt Indices for government bonds.\\n\\nPeople\\nIn July 2006 the FT announced a \"New Newsroom\" project to integrate the newspaper more closely with FT.com. At the same time it announced plans to cut the editorial staff from 525 to 475. In August 2006 it announced that all the required job cuts had been achieved through voluntary layoffs. A number of former FT journalists have gone on to high-profile jobs in journalism, politics and business. Robert Thomson, previously the paper\\'s US managing editor, was the editor of The Times and is now the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. Will Lewis, a former New York correspondent and News Editor for the FT, is the current editor of the Daily Telegraph. Dominic Lawson went on to become editor of the Sunday Telegraph until he was sacked in 2005. Andrew Adonis, a former education correspondent, became an adviser on education to the then British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and was given a job as an education minister and a seat in the House of Lords after the 2005 election. Ed Balls became chief economic adviser to the Treasury, working closely with Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer (or finance minister), before being elected a Member of Parliament in 2005, and became Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families in July 2007. Bernard Gray, a former defence correspondent and Lex columnist, was chief executive of the publishing company CMP before becoming chief executive of TSL Education, publisher of the Times Educational Supplement. David Jones, at one time the FT Night Editor, then became Head of IT. He was a key figure in the newspaper\\'s transformation from hot metal to electronic composition and then onto full-page pagination in the 1990s. He went on to become Head of Technology for the Trinity Mirror Group.\\nSir Geoffrey Owen was the editor of the Financial Times from 1981 to 1990. He joined the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) at the London School of Economics as Director of Business Policy in 1991 and was appointed Senior Fellow, Institute of Management, in 1997. He continues his work there. During his tenure at the FT he had to deal with rapid technological change and issues related to it, for example repetitive strain injury (RSI), which affected dozens of FT journalists, reporters and staff in the late 1980s.\\n\\nEditors\\nSee also\\nBusiness journalism\\nFinancial Times Business Book of the Year Award\\nFinancial Times Person of the Year\\nList of newspapers in the United Kingdom\\nThe Next Web\\nPeriodical publication\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website',\n",

Forbes also reports on related subjects such as technology, communications, science, politics, and law. Its headquarters is located in Jersey City, New Jersey. Primary competitors in the national business magazine category include Fortune and Bloomberg Businessweek. Forbes has an international edition in Asia as well as editions produced under license in 27 countries and regions worldwide.\\nThe magazine is well known for its lists and rankings, including of the richest Americans (the Forbes 400), of the America\\'s Wealthiest Celebrities, of the world\\'s top companies (the Forbes Global 2000), Forbes list of The World\\'s Most Powerful People, and The World\\'s Billionaires. The motto of Forbes magazine is \"Change the World\". Its chair and editor-in-chief is Steve Forbes, and its CEO is Mike Federle. In 2014, it was sold to a Hong Kong–based investment group, Integrated Whale Media Investments.\\n\\nCompany history\\nB. C. Forbes, a financial columnist for the Hearst papers, and his partner Walter Drey, the general manager of the Magazine of Wall Street, founded Forbes magazine on September 15, 1917. Forbes provided the money and the name and Drey provided the publishing expertise. The original name of the magazine was Forbes: Devoted to Doers and Doings. Drey became vice-president of the B.C. Forbes Publishing Company, while B.C. Forbes became editor-in-chief, a post he held until his death in 1954. B.C. Forbes was assisted in his later years by his two eldest sons, Bruce Charles Forbes (1916–1964) and Malcolm Forbes (1917–1990).\\nBruce Forbes took over on his father\\'s death, and his strengths lay in streamlining operations and developing marketing. During his tenure, 1954–1964, the magazine\\'s circulation nearly doubled.On Bruce\\'s death, his brother Malcolm Forbes became president and chief executive of Forbes and editor-in-chief of Forbes magazine. Between 1961 and 1999 the magazine was edited by James Michaels. In 1993, under Michaels, Forbes was a finalist for the National Magazine Award. In 2006, an investment group Elevation Partners that includes rock star Bono bought a minority interest in the company with a reorganization, through a new company, Forbes Media LLC, in which Forbes Magazine and Forbes.com, along with other media properties, is now a part. A 2009 New York Times report said: \"40 percent of the enterprise was sold... for a reported $300 million, setting the value of the enterprise at $750 million.\" Three years later, Mark M. Edmiston of AdMedia Partners observed, \"It\\'s probably not worth half of that now.\" It was later revealed that the price had been US$264 million.\\n\\nSale of headquarters\\nIn January 2010, Forbes reached an agreement to sell its headquarters building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to New York University; terms of the deal were not publicly reported, but Forbes was to continue to occupy the space under a five-year sale-leaseback arrangement. The company\\'s headquarters moved to the Newport section of downtown Jersey City, New Jersey, in 2014.\\n\\nSale to Integrated Whale Media (51% stake)\\nIn November 2013, Forbes Media, which publishes Forbes magazine, was put up for sale. This was encouraged by minority shareholders Elevation Partners. Sale documents prepared by Deutsche Bank revealed that the publisher\\'s 2012 EBITDA was US$15 million. Forbes reportedly sought a price of US$400 million. In July 2014, the Forbes family bought out Elevation and then Hong Kong-based investment group Integrated Whale Media Investments purchased a 51 percent majority of the company.Isaac Stone Fish wrote in the Washington Post, \"Since that purchase, there have been several instances of editorial meddling on stories involving China that raise questions about Forbes magazine\\'s commitment to editorial independence.\"\\n\\nOther publications\\nApart from Forbes and its lifestyle supplement, Forbes Life, other titles include Forbes Asia and 27 local language editions. \\n\\nSteve Forbes and his magazine\\'s writers offer investment advice on the weekly Fox TV show Forbes on Fox and on Forbes on Radio. Other company groups include Forbes Conference Group, Forbes Investment Advisory Group and Forbes Custom Media. From the 2009 Times report: \"Steve Forbes recently returned from opening up a Forbes magazine in India, bringing the number of foreign editions to 10.\" In addition, that year the company began publishing ForbesWoman, a quarterly magazine published by Steve Forbes\\'s daughter, Moira Forbes, with a companion Web site.The company formerly published American Legacy magazine as a joint venture, although that magazine separated from Forbes on May 14, 2007.The company also formerly published American Heritage and Invention & Technology magazines. After failing to find a buyer, Forbes suspended publication of these two magazines as of May 17, 2007. Both magazines were purchased by the American Heritage Publishing Company and resumed publication as of the spring of 2008.Forbes has published the Forbes Travel Guide since 2009.\\nIn 2013, Forbes licensed its brand to Ashford University, and assisted them launch the Forbes School of Business & Technology. Forbes Media CEO Mike Federle justified the licensing in 2018, stating that \"Our licensing business is almost a pure-profit business, because it\\'s an annual annuity.\" Forbes would launch limited promotions for the school in limited issues. Forbes would never formally endorse the school.\\nOn January 6, 2014, Forbes magazine announced that, in partnership with app creator Maz, it was launching a social networking app called \"Stream\". Stream allows Forbes readers to save and share visual content with other readers and discover content from Forbes magazine and Forbes.com within the app.\\n\\nForbes.com\\nForbes.com is part of Forbes Digital, a division of Forbes Media LLC. Forbes\\'s holdings include a portion of\\nRealClearPolitics. Together these sites reach more than 27 million unique visitors each month. \\nForbes.com employs the slogan \"Home Page for the World\\'s Business Leaders\" and claimed, in 2006, to be the world\\'s most widely visited business web site. The 2009 Times report said that, while \"one of the top five financial sites by traffic [throwing] off an estimated $70 million to $80 million a year in revenue, [it] never yielded the hoped-for public offering\".Forbes.com uses a \"contributor model\" in which a wide network of \"contributors\" writes and publishes articles directly on the website. Contributors are paid based on traffic to their respective Forbes.com pages; the site has received contributions from over 2,500 individuals, and some contributors have earned over US$100,000, according to the company. Forbes currently allows advertisers to publish blog posts on its website alongside regular editorial content through a program called BrandVoice, which accounts for more than 10 percent of its digital revenue. Forbes.com also publishes subscription investment newsletters, and an online guide to web sites, Best of the Web. In July 2018 Forbes deleted an article by a contributor who argued that libraries should be closed, and Amazon should open bookstores in their place.David Churbuck founded Forbes\\'s web site in 1996. The site uncovered Stephen Glass\\'s journalistic fraud in The New Republic in 1998, an article that drew attention to internet journalism. At the peak of media coverage of alleged Toyota sudden unintended acceleration in 2010, it exposed the California \"runaway Prius\" as a hoax, as well as running five other articles by Michael Fumento challenging the entire media premise of Toyota\\'s cars gone bad. The site, like the magazine, publishes many lists focusing on billionaires and their possessions, especially expensive homes, a critical aspect of the website\\'s popularity.Currently, the website also blocks internet users using ad blocking software from accessing articles, demanding that the website be put on the ad blocking software\\'s whitelist before access is granted. Forbes argues that this is done because customers using ad blocking software do not contribute to the site\\'s revenue. Malware attacks have been noted to occur from Forbes site.Forbes won the 2020 Webby People\\'s Voice Award for Business Blog/Website.\\n\\nForbes8\\nIn November 2019, Forbes launched its streaming platform Forbes8, an on-demand video network debuting a slate of original content aimed at entrepreneurs. The network currently features thousands of videos and according to Forbes is, \"a Netflix for entrepreneurs.\" In 2020, the network announced the release of several documentary series including Forbes Rap Mentors, Driven Against the Odds, Indie Nation and Titans on the Rocks.\\n\\nSee also\\nForbes 400\\nForbes 500\\nForbes Global 2000\\nThe World\\'s Billionaires\\nWorld\\'s 100 Most Powerful Women\\nWorld\\'s Most Powerful People\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nForbes, Malcolm S.

It conducts the annual Golden Globe Awards ceremony in Los Angeles every January, which honors notable examples of film and television and achievements in entertainment businesses.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe association was founded in 1943, by Los Angeles-based foreign journalists who wanted a more organized distributing process of cinema news to non-U.S. markets.The first Golden Globes awardees were for the cinema industry in early 1944 with a ceremony at 20th Century Fox. There, Jennifer Jones was awarded Best Actress honors for The Song of Bernadette which also won for Best Film, while Paul Lukas took home Best Actor laurels for Watch on the Rhine. Awards were presented in the form of scrolls.The following year members came up with the idea of presenting winners with a golden globe encircled with a strip of motion picture film and mounted on a pedestal.In 1950, differing philosophies among members caused a schism within the organization, resulting in a split into two separate groups: The Hollywood Foreign Correspondents Association and the Foreign Press Association of Hollywood. The separation ended in 1955 when the journalists reunited under the collective title The Hollywood Foreign Press Association with firm guidelines and requirements for membership.In 1955, the Golden Globes began honoring achievements in television as well as in film. The first honorees in the Best Television Show category that year were Dinah Shore, Lucy & Desi,  The American Comedy and Davy Crockett.\\n\\nMembership criteria\\nMembership meetings are held monthly, and the officers and directors are elected annually. A maximum of five journalists can be admitted to the organization each year. To retain \"Active\" status, each member must be currently accredited by the Motion Picture Association of America and must submit clippings of their work every year to renew their active status or be reassigned to a non-voting affiliate status.Requirements for active membership include primary residence in Southern California, attendance in at least four monthly general membership meetings and a minimum of four published articles or photographs per year outside the US. The HFPA does not release a list of acceptable publications for those articles but they are not restricted to popular, mainstream ones.In February 2021, the Los Angeles Times reported that none of the association\\'s members was Black.Lorenzo Soria was elected President of Hollywood Foreign Press Association in 2019. Soria later died on August 7, 2020. Ali Sar was named a president in his succession.\\n\\nCharity\\nThe HFPA is a nonprofit organization that donates funds to entertainment-related charities. The Golden Globe Awards brings in about $10 million from its television broadcast each year. The HFPA hosts an annual grants banquet to distribute funds; $2.1 million was donated to nonprofits in 2015. According to the HFPA, since 1990 more than $23.9 million was donated to charity up to 2015 and used to fund scholarships and grants.Funds have also been used to restore more than 90 films, including King Kong (1933) and Woman on the Run (1950).\\n\\nHFPA Residency\\nAs of 2018, the HFPA announced its residency program in partnership with Film Independent. The program selects three winners from the Venice Film Festival’s Orizzonti section and three participants from Toronto International Film Festival to Los Angeles for an intensive workshop.The 2019 residency fellows include Emir Baigazin, Mahmut F. Coskun, Georgia Fu, Maria Bozzi, Avril Z. Speaks, Rati Tsiteladze, Cynthia Kao.The 2020 residency program winners were TIFF participants: All These Creatures by Australian Charles Williams, Misterio by Chema Garcia from Spain, and Measure by Canadian director Karen Chapman. This is in addition to Venice winners: Atlantis, by Ukrainian Valentyn Vasyanovych, Blanco en Blanco by Spaniard Théo Court and Filipino Raymund Ribay Gutierrez.The 2021 residency program winners were TIFF participants: Hair: The Story of Grass, Maha Al–Saati\\'s, Jeff Wong\\'s H’mong Sisters, and Matria by Alvaro Gago Diaz. This is in addition to the Venice winners in the Orizzonti section: Best Film - Dashte Kamoush (The Wasteland), by Ahmad Kahrimi;  Lahi, Hayop (Genus Pan), Lav Diaz Best Director, and Special Jury Prize Listen, by Ana Rocha de Sousa.\\n\\nControversy\\nAccording to The Times “The HFPA does not publicly list its members but some details of its workings have emerged. It includes no black people but does feature a former Miss Universe, a Russian bodybuilder turned filmmaker and a Finn who has two books and a DVD on the Chinese art of face-reading.” A lawsuit by two journalists accuses the organisers of operating as a corrupt and secretive “cartel”.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website \\nHollywood Foreign Press Association at IMDb',\n",
              " 'IMDb': 'IMDb (an acronym for Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online – including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is now owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.\\nAs of December 2020, IMDb has approximately 7.5 million titles (including episodes) and 10.4 million personalities in its database, as well as 83 million registered users.\\nIMDb began as a movie database on the Usenet group \"rec.arts.movies\" in 1990 and moved to the web in 1993.\\n\\nFeatures\\nThe movie and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all internet users, but a registration process is necessary to contribute information to the site.\\nMost data in the database is provided by volunteer contributors. The site enables registered users to submit new material and edits to existing entries. Users with a proven track record of submitting data are given instant approval for additions or corrections to cast, credits, and other demographics of media product and personalities. However, image, name, character name, plot summaries, and title changes are supposedly screened before publication, and usually take between 24 and 72 hours to appear.\\nAll registered users can choose their own site name, and most operate anonymously. They have a profile page which shows how long a registered user has been a member, as well as personal movie ratings (should the user decide to display them) and, since 2015, \"badges\" are added representing how many contributions a particular registered user has submitted. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, bios, etc. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb page, then that user/visitor can add photos to that page by enrolling in IMDbPRO. There is no single index of contributors, no index on each profile page of the items contributed, and (except for plot synopses and biographies) no identification of contributors to each product\\'s or person\\'s data pages.\\nUsers are also invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a weighted mean-rating that is displayed beside each title, with online filters employed to deter ballot-stuffing.\\nIn January 2019, IMDb launched a free movie streaming platform called Freedive, an ad-supported service offering Hollywood movie titles and TV shows. Many Freedive titles are licensed from Sony Pictures. Subsequently, in June 2019, Freedive was rebranded as IMDbTV, during the launch of which, the amount of content contained on the platform was tripled.\\n\\nHistory\\nHistory before website\\nIMDb originated with a Usenet posting entitled \"Those Eyes\", by the British film fan and computer programmer Col Needham, about actresses with beautiful eyes. Others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own. Needham subsequently started an \"Actors List\", while Dave Knight began a \"Directors List\", and Andy Krieg took over \"THE LIST\" from Hank Driskill, which would later be renamed the \"Actress List\". Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working, but soon retired people were added, so Needham started what was then (but did not remain) a separate \"Dead Actors/Actresses List\". Steve Hammond started collecting and merging character names for both the actors and actresses lists. When these achieved popularity, they were merged back into the lists themselves. The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible.\\nBy late 1990, the lists included almost 10,000 films and television series, correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein. On October 17, 1990, Needham developed and posted a collection of Unix shell scripts that could be used to search the four lists, and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born. At the time, it was known as the \"rec.arts.movies movie database\".\\n\\nOn the web\\nThe database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay. Later, in 1993, it moved onto the fledgling World Wide Web under the name of Cardiff Internet Movie Database. The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of Cardiff University in Wales. Rob Hartill was the original web interface author. In 1994, the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein. Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of mirrors across the world with donated bandwidth.\\n\\nAs an independent company\\nIn 1996 IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom, becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd. Founder Col Needham became the primary owner. General revenue for site operations was generated through advertising, licensing and partnerships.\\n\\nAs Amazon.com subsidiary (1998–present)\\nIn 1998, Jeff Bezos, founder, owner, and CEO of Amazon.com, struck a deal with Needham and other principal shareholders to buy IMDb outright for approximately $55 million and attach it to Amazon as a subsidiary, private company. This gave IMDb the ability to pay the shareholders salaries for their work, while Amazon.com would be able to use IMDb as an advertising resource for selling DVDs and videotapes.\\nIMDb continued to expand its functionality. On January 15, 2002, it added a subscription service known as IMDbPro, aimed at entertainment professionals. IMDbPro was announced and launched at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. It provides a variety of services including film production and box office details, a company directory, and the ability of subscribers to add personal information pages with details at variance.\\nAs an additional incentive for users, as of 2003, users identified as one of \"the top 100 contributors\" of hard data received complimentary free access to IMDbPro for the following calendar year; for 2006 this was increased to the top 150 contributors, and for 2010 to the top 250. In 2008, IMDb launched their first official foreign-language version with the German IMDb.de. Also in 2008, IMDb acquired two other companies: Withoutabox and Box Office Mojo.The website was originally Perl-based, but IMDb no longer discloses what software it uses for reasons of security. In 2010, the site was filtered in China.In 2016, The IMDb Studio at Sundance was launched, a talk show that is presented on IMDb and YouTube.\\n\\nIMDbPro\\nActors, crew, and industry executives can post their own resume and upload photos of themselves for a yearly membership fee to IMDbPro. IMDbPro can be accessed by anyone willing to pay the fee, which is US$19.99 per month, or if paid annually, US$149.99. Membership enables a user to access the rank order of each industry personality, as well as agent contact information for any actor, producer, director etc. that has an IMDb page. Enrolling in IMDbPro enables members who are industry personnel to upload a head shot to open their page, as well as to upload hundreds of photos to accompany their page. Anyone can register as an IMDb user and contribute to the site as well as view its content; however those users enrolled in IMDbPro have greater access and privileges.\\n\\nCharacters\\' filmography\\nOn October 2, 2007, the characters\\' filmography was added. Character entries are created from character listings in the main filmography database, and as such do not need any additional verification by IMDb staff. They have already been verified when they are added to the main filmography.\\n\\nIMDb TV\\nOn January 10, 2019, IMDb launched Freedive, a streaming service that offers certain films free with advertisements. Due to international licensing restrictions, the service currently is only available in the United States as of 2019.Freedive was the company\\'s second attempt at a streaming service. IMDb had previously launched a similar feature in 2008 that was later discontinued.In June 2019, IMDb announced that its streaming service would be renamed IMDb TV, with a planned launch in Europe later that year. The service has licensed films and TV series from Warner Bros., Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM. In February 2020, the service licensed 21 television series from Disney–ABC Domestic Television.IMDb TV has also bought the streaming rights to the Alex Rider TV series in the U.S that has been streaming  on Amazon\\'s Prime Video in the UK, Latin America, Germany and Austria.\\n\\nContent and format\\nData provided by subjects\\nIn 2006, IMDb introduced its \"Résumé Subscription Service\", where actors and crew can post their own résumé and upload photos of themselves for a yearly fee. The base annual charge for including a photo with an account was US$39.95 until 2010, when it was increased to US$54.95. IMDb résumé pages are kept on a sub-page of the regular entry about that person, with a regular entry automatically created for each résumé subscriber who does not already have one.As of 2012, Resume Services is now included as part of an IMDbPro subscription and is no longer offered as a separate subscription service.\\n\\nCopyright, vandalism and error issues\\nAll volunteers who contribute content to the database technically retain copyright on their contributions, but the compilation of the content becomes the exclusive property of IMDb with the full right to copy, modify, and sublicense it, and they are verified before posting. Credit is not given on specific title or filmography pages to the contributor(s) who have provided information. Conversely, a credited text entry, such as a plot summary, may be corrected for content, grammar, sentence structure, perceived omission or error, by other contributors without having to add their names as co-authors. Due to the time required for processing submitted data or text before it is displayed, IMDb is different from user-contributed projects like  Discogs, or OpenStreetMap, or Wikipedia, in that contributors cannot add, delete, or modify the data or text on impulse, and the manipulation of data is controlled by IMDb technology and salaried staff.IMDb has been subject to deliberate additions of false information; in 2012 a spokesperson said: \"We make it easy for users and professionals to update much of our content, which is why we have an \\'edit page.\\' The data that is submitted goes through a series of consistency checks before it goes live. Given the sheer volume of the information, occasional mistakes are inevitable, and, when reported, they are promptly fixed. We always welcome corrections.\"The Java Movie Database (JMDB) is reportedly creating an IMDb_Error.log file that lists all the errors found while processing the IMDb plain text files. A Wiki alternative to IMDb is Open Media Database whose content is also contributed by users but licensed under CC-by and the GFDL. Since 2007, IMDb has been experimenting with wiki-programmed sections for complete film synopses, parental guides, and FAQs about titles as determined by (and answered by) individual contributors.\\n\\nData format and access\\nIMDb does not provide an API for automated queries. However, most of the data can be downloaded as compressed plain text files and the information can be extracted using the command-line interface tools provided. There is also a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files, which allows a search and a display of the information. This GUI application supports different languages, but the movie related data are in English, as made available by IMDb. A Python package called IMDbPY can also be used to process the compressed plain text files into a number of different SQL databases, enabling easier access to the entire dataset for searching or data mining.\\n\\nFilm titles\\nThe IMDb has sites in English as well as versions translated completely or in part into other languages (Danish, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Romanian). The non-English language sites display film titles in the specified language. Originally, IMDb\\'s English language sites displayed titles according to their original country-of-origin language, however, in 2010 IMDb began allowing individual users in the UK and USA to choose primary title display by either the original-language titles, or the US or UK release title (normally, in English).\\n\\nAncillary features\\nUser ratings of films\\nAs one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a rating scale that allows users to rate films on a scale of one to ten.\\nIMDb indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways in order to produce a weighted mean that is displayed for each film, series, and so on. It states that filters are used to avoid ballot stuffing; the method is not described in detail to avoid attempts to circumvent it. In fact, it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the weighted average and the arithmetic mean.\\n\\nRankings\\nThe IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by the registered users of the website using the methods described. As of 1 August 2020, The Shawshank Redemption is #1 on the list. The \"Top 250\" rating is based on only the ratings of \"regular voters\". The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret. IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top 250 list they \"deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter\". In addition to other weightings, the Top 250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in actuarial science as a credibility formula. This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information; in this case from eligible users who submit ratings. Although the current formula is not disclosed, IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating:\\nwhere:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        W\\n         \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle W\\\\ }\\n   = weighted rating\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        R\\n         \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle R\\\\ }\\n   = average for the movie as a number from 1 to 10 (mean) = (Rating)\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n         \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v\\\\ }\\n   = number of votes for the movie = (votes)\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        m\\n         \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle m\\\\ }\\n   = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 25,000)\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        C\\n         \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle C\\\\ }\\n   = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 7.0)The \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        W\\n         \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle W\\\\ }\\n   in this formula is equivalent to a Bayesian posterior mean (see Bayesian statistics).\\nThe IMDb also has a Bottom 100 feature which is assembled through a similar process although only 10,000 votes must be received to qualify for the list.The Top 250 list comprises a wide range of feature films, including major releases, cult films, independent films, critically acclaimed films, silent films, and non-English-language films. Documentaries, short films and TV episodes are not currently included.\\nSince 2015, there has been a Top 250 list devoted to ranking television shows.\\n\\nMessage boards\\nBeginning in 2001, the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title (excepting, as of 2013, TV episodes) and name entry, along with over 140 main boards. In order to post on the message boards a user needed to \"authenticate\" their account via cell phone, credit card, or by having been a recent customer of the parent company Amazon.com. Message boards expanded in recent years. The Soapbox started in 1999 as a general message board meant for debates on any subjects. The Politics board started in 2007 was a message board to discuss politics, news events, and current affairs, as well as history and economics.By February 20, 2017, all the message boards and their content were permanently removed. According to the website, the decision was made because the boards were \"no longer providing a positive, useful experience for the vast majority of our more than 250 million monthly users worldwide\", and others have mentioned its susceptibility to trolling and disagreeable behavior. Col Needham also mentioned in a post some months earlier that the boards received less income from ads, and that their members only made up a very small part of the website\\'s visitors. The boards were costly to run due to the system\\'s age and dated design, which did not make business sense. The decision to remove the message boards was met with outspoken backlash from some of its users, and sparked an online petition garnering over 8,000 signatures. In the days leading up to February 20, 2017, both Archive.org and MovieChat.org preserved the entire contents of the IMDb message boards using web scraping. Archive.org and MovieChat.org have published IMDb message board archives, which is legal under the fair use doctrine, because it has no effect on IMDb\\'s potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\\n\\nStatistics\\nAs of December 2020, IMDb has the following statistics:\\n\\nLitigation\\nIn 2011, in the case of Hoang v. Amazon.com, Inc., IMDb was sued by an anonymous actress for more than US$1,000,000 due to IMDb\\'s revealing her age (40, at the time). The actress claimed that revealing her age could cause her to lose acting opportunities. Judge Marsha J. Pechman, a U.S. district judge in Seattle, dismissed the lawsuit, saying the actress had no grounds to proceed with an anonymous complaint. The actress re-filed and so revealed that she was Huong Hoang of Texas, who uses the stage name Junie Hoang. In 2013, Pechman dismissed all causes of action except for a breach of contract claim against IMDb; a jury then sided with IMDb on that claim. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court judgment in March 2015.Also in 2011, in the case of United Video Properties Inc., et al. v. Amazon.Com Inc. et al., IMDb and Amazon were sued by Rovi Corporation and others for patent infringement over their various program listing offerings. The patent claims were ultimately construed in a way favorable to IMDb, and Rovi / United Video Properties lost the case. In April 2014, the decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals.On January 1, 2017, the State of California implemented state bill AB-1687, a SAG-AFTRA-backed anti-ageism statute which requires \"commercial online entertainment employment services\" to honor requests by their subscribers for their ages and birthdays to be hidden. By the beginning of 2017, IMDb had received more than 2,300 requests from individuals to remove their date of birth from the site. Included in this group were 10 Academy Award winners and another 71 nominated for Oscars, Emmys, or Golden Globes.\\nOn February 23, 2017, Judge Vince Girdhari Chhabria issued a stay on the bill pending a further trial, claiming that it possibly violated the First Amendment because it inhibited the public consumption of information. He also questioned the intent of the bill, as it was ostensibly meant to target IMDb.\\n\\nBirth names publication policy\\nIMDb had long maintained that it would keep all valid information, but changed that policy related to birth names on August 12, 2019. IMDb will now remove birth names that are not widely and publicly known, of persons who no longer use their birth names. This was done in response to pressure from LGBTQ groups against the publication of transgender birth names without their consent, which is called \"dead-naming\". Any name a person had previously been credited under will be maintained though in the credits section.\\n\\nSee also\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nIMDb – official site',\n",
              " 'ISBN (identifier)': 'The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a numeric commercial book identifier which is intended to be unique. Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency.An ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation (except reprintings) of a publication. For example, an e-book, a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book will each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007, and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.\\nThe initial ISBN identification format was devised in 1967, based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (the 9-digit SBN code can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit \\'0\\').\\nPrivately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns such books ISBNs on its own initiative.Another identifier, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers. The International Standard Music Number (ISMN) covers musical scores.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe Standard Book Number (SBN) is a commercial system using nine-digit code numbers to identify books. It was created by Gordon Foster, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at Trinity College, Dublin, for the booksellers and stationers WHSmith and others in 1965. The ISBN identification format was conceived in 1967 in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker (regarded as the \"Father of the ISBN\") and in 1968 in the United States by Emery Koltay (who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency R. R. Bowker).The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108. The United Kingdom continued to use the nine-digit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46/Subcommittee 9 TC 46/SC 9. The ISO on-line facility only refers back to 1978.An SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit \"0\". For example, the second edition of Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns, published by Hodder in 1965, has \"SBN 340 01381 8\", where \"340\" indicates the publisher, \"01381\" is the serial number assigned by the publisher, and \"8\" is the check digit. By prefixing a zero, this can be converted to ISBN 0-340-01381-8; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated. Some publishers, such as Ballantine Books, would sometimes use 12-digit SBNs where the last three digits indicated the price of the book; for example, Woodstock Handmade Houses had a 12-digit Standard Book Number of 345-24223-8-595 (valid SBN: 345-24223-8, ISBN: 0-345-24223-8), and it cost US$5.95.Since 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained thirteen digits, a format that is compatible with \"Bookland\" European Article Numbers, which have 13 digits.\\n\\nOverview\\nA separate ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a publication. For example, an ebook, audiobook, paperback, and hardcover edition of the same book will each have a different ISBN assigned to it. The ISBN is thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and ten digits long if assigned before 2007. An International Standard Book Number consists of four parts (if it is a 10-digit ISBN) or five parts (for a 13-digit ISBN).\\nSection 5 of the International ISBN Agency\\'s official user manual describes the structure of the 13-digit ISBN, as follows:\\n\\nfor a 13-digit ISBN, a prefix element – a GS1 prefix: so far 978 or 979 have been made available by GS1,\\nthe registration group element (language-sharing country group, individual country or territory),\\nthe registrant element,\\nthe publication element, and\\na checksum character or check digit.A 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts (prefix element, registration group, registrant, publication and check digit), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces. Separating the parts (registration group, registrant, publication and check digit) of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.\\n\\nHow ISBNs are issued\\nISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded.A full directory of ISBN agencies is available on the International ISBN Agency website. List for a few countries is given below:\\n\\nAustralia – Thorpe-Bowker\\nBrazil – The National Library of Brazil; (Up to 28 February 2020)\\nBrazil – Câmara Brasileira do Livro (From 1 March 2020)\\nCanada – English Library and Archives Canada, a government agency; French Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec;\\nColombia – Cámara Colombiana del Libro, an NGO\\nHong Kong – Books Registration Office (BRO), under the Hong Kong Public Libraries\\nIndia – The Raja Rammohun Roy National Agency for ISBN (Book Promotion and Copyright Division), under Department of Higher Education, a constituent of the Ministry of Human Resource Development\\nIceland – Landsbókasafn (National and University Library of Iceland)\\nIsrael – The Israel Center for Libraries\\nItaly – EDISER srl, owned by Associazione Italiana Editori (Italian Publishers Association)\\nMaldives – The National Bureau of Classification (NBC)\\nMalta – The National Book Council (Maltese: Il-Kunsill Nazzjonali tal-Ktieb)\\nMorocco – The National Library of Morocco\\nNew Zealand – The National Library of New Zealand\\nPakistan – National Library of Pakistan\\nPhilippines – National Library of the Philippines\\nSouth Africa – National Library of South Africa\\nSpain – Spanish ISBN Agency – Agencia del ISBN\\nTurkey – General Directorate of Libraries and Publications, a branch of the Ministry of Culture\\nUnited Kingdom and Republic of Ireland – Nielsen Book Services Ltd, part of Nielsen Holdings N.V.\\nUnited States – R. R. Bowker\\n\\nRegistration group element\\nThe ISBN registration group element is a 1- to 5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979), and can be separated between hyphens, such as \"978-1-...\". Registration groups have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element. The single-digit registration groups within the 978-prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People\\'s Republic of China. An example 5-digit registration group is 99936, for Bhutan. The allocated registration groups are: 0–5, 600–625, 65, 7, 80–94, 950–989, 9917–9989, and 99901–99983. Books published in rare languages typically have longer group elements.Within the 979 prefix element, the registration group 0 is reserved for compatibility with International Standard Music Numbers (ISMNs), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN. The registration groups within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 8 for the United States of America, 10 for France, 11 for the Republic of Korea, and 12 for Italy.The original 9-digit standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but prefixing a zero (0) to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN.\\n\\nRegistrant element\\nThe national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element (cf. Category:ISBN agencies) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not legally required to assign an ISBN, although most large bookstores only handle publications that have ISBNs assigned to them.A listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published, and can be ordered in book form. The web site of the ISBN agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes. Partial lists have been compiled (from library catalogs) for the English-language groups: identifier 0 and identifier 1.\\nPublishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.\\nBy using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements. Here are some sample ISBN-10 codes, illustrating block length variations.\\n\\nPattern for English language ISBNs\\nEnglish-language registration group elements are 0 and 1 (2 of more than 220 registration group elements). These two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern, which allows their length to be determined, as follows:\\n\\nCheck digits\\nA check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection, the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit. It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the 10-digit ISBN is an extension of that for SBNs, so the two systems are compatible; an SBN prefixed with a zero (the 10-digit ISBN) will give the same check digit as the SBN without the zero. The check digit is base eleven, and can be an integer between 0 and 9, or an \\'X\\'. The system for 13-digit ISBNs is not compatible with SBNs and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10-digit ISBN, so does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the 13-digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format, and hence could not contain an \\'X\\'.\\n\\nISBN-10 check digits\\nAccording to the 2001 edition of the International ISBN Agency\\'s official user manual, the ISBN-10 check digit (which is the last digit of the 10-digit ISBN) must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol \\'X\\' is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of 11. That is, if xi is the ith digit, then x10 must be chosen such that:\\n\\nFor example, for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-2:\\n\\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, this is rendered:\\n\\nIt is also true for ISBN-10s that the sum of all ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. For this example:\\n\\nFormally, this is rendered:\\n\\nThe two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g. when typing it or writing it down) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be proven mathematically that all pairs of valid ISBN-10s differ in at least two digits. It can also be proven that there are no pairs of valid ISBN-10s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits. (These proofs are true because the ISBN is less than eleven digits long and because 11 is a prime number.) The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e., if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN – the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error were to occur in the publishing house and remain undetected, the book would be issued with an invalid ISBN.In contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN (although it is still unlikely).\\n\\nISBN-10 check digit calculation\\nEach of the first nine digits of the 10-digit ISBN—excluding the check digit itself—is multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which, when added to this sum, means the total is a multiple of 11.\\nFor example, the check digit for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\\n\\nAdding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (because 132 = 12×11) – this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so. Therefore, the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is ISBN 0-306-40615-2. If the value of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            10\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x_{10}}\\n   required to satisfy this condition is 10, then an \\'X\\' should be used.\\nAlternatively, modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 (i.e. its value modulo 11), is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation, the calculation could result in a check digit value of 11−0 = 11, which is invalid. (Strictly speaking, the first \"modulo 11\" is not needed, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.)\\nFor example, the check digit for the ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\\n\\nThus the check digit is 2.\\nIt is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples:\\n\\nThe modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case s could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid ISBN 99999-999-9-X), or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition.\\n\\nISBN-13 check digit calculation\\nAppendix 1 of the International ISBN Agency\\'s official user manual describes how the 13-digit ISBN check digit is calculated. The ISBN-13 check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of 10. As ISBN-13 is a subset of EAN-13, the algorithm for calculating the check digit is exactly the same for both.\\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, this is rendered:\\n\\nThe calculation of an ISBN-13 check digit begins with the first twelve digits of the 13-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero (0) replaces a ten (10), so, in all cases, a single check digit results.\\nFor example, the ISBN-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\\n\\ns = 9×1 + 7×3 + 8×1 + 0×3 + 3×1 + 0×3 + 6×1 + 4×3 + 0×1 + 6×3 + 1×1 + 5×3\\n  =   9 +  21 +   8 +   0 +   3 +   0 +   6 +  12 +   0 +  18 +   1 +  15\\n  = 93\\n93 / 10 = 9 remainder 3\\n10 –  3 = 7\\n\\nThus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7.\\nIn general, the ISBN-13 check digit is calculated as follows.\\nLet\\n\\nThen\\n\\nThis check system – similar to the UPC check digit formula – does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3×6+1×1 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3×1+1×6 = 9. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The ISBN-10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0–9 to express the check digit.\\nAdditionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).\\n\\nISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion\\nAn ISBN-10 is converted to ISBN-13 by prepending \"978\" to the  ISBN-10 and recalculating the final checksum digit using the ISBN-13 algorithm. The reverse process can also be performed, but not for numbers commencing with a prefix other than 978, which have no 10-digit equivalent.\\n\\nErrors in usage\\nPublishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers. For example, ISBN 0-590-76484-5 is shared by two books – Ninja gaiden®: a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo (1990) and Wacky laws (1997), both published by Scholastic.\\nMost libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The Library of Congress catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase \"Cancelled ISBN\". However, book-ordering systems such as Amazon.com will not search for a book if an invalid ISBN is entered to its search engine. OCLC often indexes by invalid ISBNs, if the book is indexed in that way by a member library.\\n\\neISBN\\nOnly the term \"ISBN\" should be used; the terms \"eISBN\" and \"e-ISBN\" have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided. If a book exists in one or more digital (e-book) formats, each of those formats must have its own ISBN. In other words, each of the three separate EPUB, Amazon Kindle, and PDF formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN. They should not share the ISBN of the paper version, and there is no generic \"eISBN\" which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title.\\n\\nEAN format used in barcodes, and upgrading\\nCurrently the barcodes on a book\\'s back cover (or inside a mass-market paperback book\\'s front cover) are EAN-13; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an EAN-5 for the currency and the recommended retail price. For 10-digit ISBNs, the number \"978\", the Bookland \"country code\", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN-13 formula (modulo 10, 1x and 3x weighting on alternating digits).\\nPartly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) decided to migrate to a 13-digit ISBN (ISBN-13). The process began on 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude on 1 January 2007. As of 2011, all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN. The 10-digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an \"M\" letter; the bar code represents the \"M\" as a zero (0), and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now thirteen digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by ISBN.\\nPublisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the 10-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the 13-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range.Barcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the ISBN-13 barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to information technology systems. Hence, many booksellers (e.g., Barnes & Noble) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the UPC barcode system to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the ISBN-13 in North America.\\n\\nSee also\\nASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number)\\nBICI (Book Item and Component Identifier)\\nCODEN (serial publication identifier currently used by libraries; replaced by the ISSN for new works)\\nDOI (Digital Object Identifier)\\nESTC (English Short Title Catalogue)\\nETTN (Electronic Textbook Track Number)\\nISAN (International Standard Audiovisual Number)\\nISMN (International Standard Music Number)\\nISRC (International Standard Recording Code)\\nISSN (International Standard Serial Number)\\nISTC (International Standard Text Code)\\nISWC (International Standard Musical Work Code)\\nISWN (International Standard Wine Number)\\nLCCN (Library of Congress Control Number)\\nLicense number (East German books) (Book identification system used between 1951 and 1990 in the former GDR)\\nList of group-0 ISBN publisher codes\\nList of group-1 ISBN publisher codes\\nList of ISBN identifier groups\\nOCLC number (Online Computer Library Center number)\\nRegistration authority\\nSICI (Serial Item and Contribution Identifier)\\nVD 16 (Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachbereich erschienenen Drucke des 16.

              " 'Interview with the Vampire (film)': 'Interview with the Vampire is a 1994 American gothic horror film directed by Neil Jordan, based on Anne Rice\\'s 1976 novel of the same name, and starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. The film focuses on Lestat (Cruise) and Louis (Pitt), beginning with Louis\\'s transformation into a vampire by Lestat in 1791. The film chronicles their time together, and their turning of ten-year-old Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) into a vampire. The narrative is framed by a present-day interview, in which Louis tells his story to a San Francisco reporter. The supporting cast features Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas, and Stephen Rea.\\nThe film was released in November 1994 to generally positive reviews and was a commercial success. It received Oscar nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Original Score. Kirsten Dunst was additionally nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film. A stand-alone sequel, Queen of the Damned, was released in 2002, with Stuart Townsend replacing Cruise as Lestat.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn modern-day San Francisco, reporter Daniel Molloy interviews Louis de Pointe du Lac, who claims to be a vampire. Louis describes his human life as a wealthy plantation owner in 1791 Spanish Louisiana. Despondent following the death of his wife and unborn child, he drunkenly wanders the waterfront of New Orleans one night and is attacked by the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt. Lestat senses Louis\\'s dissatisfaction with life and offers to turn him into a vampire. Louis accepts, but quickly comes to regret it. While Lestat revels in the hunt and killing of humans, Louis resists his instinct to kill, instead drinking animal blood to sustain himself. Disgusted by Lestat\\'s pleasure in killing, Louis comes to suffer tremendously as a vampire.\\nWandering the streets of New Orleans amid an outbreak of plague, Louis can resist his hunger no more and feeds on a little girl whose mother died in the plague. To entice Louis to stay with him, Lestat turns the dying girl, Claudia, into a vampire. Together, they raise her as a daughter. Louis has a pure fatherly love for Claudia, while Lestat spoils and treats her more as a pupil, training her to become a merciless killer. Thirty years pass, and Claudia matures psychologically but remains a little girl in appearance and continues to be treated as such by Lestat. When she finally realizes that she will never grow older or become a mature woman, she is furious with Lestat and tells Louis that they should leave him. She tricks Lestat into drinking the \"dead blood\" of twin boys whom she killed by overdose with laudanum, which weakens Lestat, and then slits his throat. Though Louis is shocked and upset by Lestat\\'s death, he helps Claudia dump Lestat\\'s body in an alligator swamp. They spend weeks planning a voyage to Europe to search for other vampires, but Lestat returns on the night of their departure, having survived on the blood of swamp creatures. Lestat attacks them, but Louis sets him on fire and, in the ensuing blaze, they are able to escape to their ship and depart.\\nAfter traveling around Europe and the Mediterranean but finding no other vampires, Louis and Claudia settle harmoniously in Paris in 1870. Louis encounters vampires Santiago and Armand by chance. Armand invites Louis and Claudia to his coven, the Théâtre des Vampires, where the vampires stage theatrical horror shows for humans. On their way out of the theater, Santiago reads Louis\\'s mind and suspects that Louis and Claudia murdered Lestat. Armand warns Louis to send Claudia away for her own safety, and Louis is intrigued to stay with Armand and learn about the meaning of being a vampire. Claudia demands that Louis turn a human woman, Madeleine, into a vampire to be her new protector and companion, and he reluctantly complies. Shortly thereafter, the Parisian vampires abduct the three of them and punish them for Lestat\\'s murder, imprisoning Louis in a coffin and trapping Claudia and Madeleine in a chamber, where sunlight burns them to ash. Armand does nothing to prevent this, but the next day he frees Louis. Seeking revenge, Louis returns to the theater at dawn and sets it on fire, killing all the vampires. Armand arrives in time to help Louis escape the sunrise, and once again offers him a place by his side. Louis rejects Armand and leaves, knowing Armand had allowed Claudia\\'s murder so that he could have Louis to himself.\\nAs decades pass, Louis never recovers from the loss of Claudia and dejectedly explores the world alone. He returns to New Orleans in 1988 and one night encounters a decayed, weakened Lestat, living as a recluse in an abandoned mansion and surviving on rat blood as Louis once had. Lestat expresses regret for having turned Claudia into a vampire and asks Louis to rejoin him, but Louis declines and leaves. Louis concludes his interview with Molloy, prompting Molloy to beseech Louis to make him his new vampire companion. Louis is outraged that Molloy has not understood the tale of suffering he has related, and attacks Molloy to scare him into abandoning the idea. Louis then vanishes, and Molloy runs to his car and takes off, while playing the cassette tapes of Louis\\' interview in his car. On the Golden Gate Bridge, Lestat appears and attacks Molloy, taking control of the car. Revived by Molloy\\'s blood, Lestat offers Molloy the choice that he \"never had\" — whether or not to become a vampire — and, laughing, continues driving over the bridge.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nThe rights to Rice\\'s novel were initially purchased by Paramount Pictures in April 1976, shortly before the book was published. However, the script lingered in development hell for years, with the rights being sold to Lorimar before finally ending up with Warner Bros. Director Neil Jordan was approached by Warner Bros. to direct after the huge success of his movie The Crying Game (1992). Jordan was intrigued by the script, calling it \"really interesting and slightly theatrical\", but was especially interested after reading Rice\\'s novel. He agreed to direct on the condition that he be allowed to write his own script, though he did not gain a writing credit. The themes of Catholic guilt which pervade the novel attracted Jordan, who called the story \"the most wonderful parable about wallowing in guilt that I\\'d ever come across. But these things are unconscious, I don\\'t have an agenda.\"With David Geffen producing, the movie was given a $70 million budget, unprecedented for a film in the vampire genre. Jordan stated that:\\n\\n\"It\\'s not very often you can make a complicated, dark, dangerous movie and get a big budget for it. Vampire movies were traditionally made at the lower end of the scale, on a shoestring, on rudimentary sets. David Geffen is very powerful and he poured money into Interview. I wanted to make it on an epic scale of something like Gone with the Wind\".\\n\\nCasting\\nAuthor Anne Rice adapted her 1976 novel Interview with the Vampire into a screenplay with French actor Alain Delon in mind for the role of Louis. Later on, when Interview entered the casting stage, British actor Julian Sands was championed by Anne Rice and fans of the novel to play Lestat, but because Sands was not a well-known name at the time (being only famed for his performance in A Room with a View), he was rejected and the role was given to Tom Cruise. Because of his star power, Cruise received a record $10 million salary and a percentage of the profits. The casting was initially criticized by Anne Rice, who said that Cruise was \"no more my vampire Lestat than Edward G. Robinson is Rhett Butler\", and the casting was \"so bizarre; it\\'s almost impossible to imagine how it\\'s going to work\". She recommended a number of other actors including John Malkovich, Peter Weller, Jeremy Irons, and Alexander Godunov. She suggested that Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise switch roles, stating that \"I tried for a long time to tell them that they should just reverse these roles—have Brad Pitt play Lestat and have Tom Cruise play Louis. Of course, they don\\'t listen to me.\"Eventually, Rice became satisfied with Cruise\\'s performance after seeing the completed film, saying that \"from the moment he appeared, Tom was Lestat for me\" and \"that Tom did make Lestat work was something I could not see in a crystal ball.\" She called Cruise to compliment him and admit that she was wrong.Due to Rice\\'s perception of Hollywood\\'s homophobia, at one point she rewrote the part of Louis, changing his sex to female, in order to specifically heterosexualize the character\\'s relationship with Lestat. At the time, Rice felt it was the only way to get the film made, and singer-actress Cher was considered for the part. A song titled \"Lovers Forever\", which Cher wrote along with Shirley Eikhard for the film\\'s soundtrack, got rejected as Pitt was ultimately cast for the role, though a dance-pop version of the song was released on Cher\\'s 2013 album, Closer to the Truth.Originally, River Phoenix was cast for the role of Daniel Molloy (as Anne Rice liked the idea), but he died four weeks before he was due to begin filming. When Christian Slater was cast in his place as Molloy, he donated his entire salary to Phoenix\\'s favorite charitable organizations. The film has a dedication to Phoenix after the end credits. Eleven-year-old actress Kirsten Dunst was spotted by talent scouts and was the first girl tested for the role of Claudia.\\n\\nFilming\\nFilming took place primarily in New Orleans and in London, with limited location shooting done in San Francisco and Paris. Louis\\'s plantation was a combination of primarily Destrehan Plantation, just west of New Orleans, and Oak Alley Plantation in nearby Vacherie. The depiction of 18th- and early-19th-century New Orleans was achieved with a combination of location shooting in the French Quarter of New Orleans and filming on a purpose-built waterfront set along the Mississippi river. Production then moved to London, where interior sets were constructed at Pinewood Studios. The sets designed by Dante Ferretti included the interiors of Louis, Lestat and Claudia\\'s New Orleans townhouse, Claudia and Louis\\'s Paris hotel suite, the Théâtre des Vampires (built on Pinewood\\'s 007 Stage), and the catacombs where the Parisien vampires live. Shooting took place in San Francisco, mainly on the Golden Gate Bridge, with the external façade of Louis\\'s hotel located at the intersection of Taylor Street, Market Street, and Golden Gate Avenue. In Paris the exterior and lobby of the Opera Garnier were dressed to film Louis and Claudia\\'s arrival at their hotel in Paris.\\nBrad Pitt admitted in a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly that he was \"miserable\" while making the film and even tried to buy himself out of his contract at one point. Pitt called the production \"six-months of f---king darkness\" because of the almost-exclusive night shoots, filmed mostly in London in the depths of winter, which sent him into a depression. The script, which he received only two weeks prior to filming, was also a source of disappointment. He unfavorably contrasted the character of Louis which he had admired in the book to that presented in the script:\\n\\nIn the book you have this guy asking, \\'Who am I?\\' Which was probably applicable to me at that time: \\'Am I good? Am I of the angels? Am I bad? Am I of the devil?\\' In the book it is a guy going on this search of discovery. And in the meantime, he has this Lestat character that he\\'s entranced by and abhors. ... In the movie, they took the sensational aspects of Lestat and made that the pulse of the film, and those things are very enjoyable and very good, but for me, there was just nothing to do—you just sit and watch.\\n\\nSpecial effects\\nVisual effects were overseen by Stan Winston and his team, while the newly founded Digital Domain was responsible for creating the digital effects under Visual Effects Supervisor Robert Legato. Director Neil Jordan was initially hesitant to use Stan Winston Studios, because they had gained a reputation for specializing in large-scale animatronics and CGI with Jurassic Park and Terminator 2: Judgment Day; Interview with the Vampire was going to require mostly makeup effects. Winston designed the characters\\' vampire appearances and makeup effects, including a technique for stenciling translucent blue veins on the actors\\' faces. This required the actors to hang upside down for 30 minutes, so that the blood would rush to their heads and cause their veins to protrude, enabling the makeup artists to trace realistic patterns.Digital effects were used mainly to add small details or to enhance certain physical effects, like the burning of the New Orleans set or the burning of Louis\\'s plantation, whereby CGI flames were imposed on a miniature of the house. The most difficult digital effects to illustrate were Louis and Claudia\\'s transformations into vampires, which were technologically very advanced for the time. The scene where Claudia cuts Lestat\\'s throat was achieved by transferring from Tom Cruise bleeding from a prosthetic wound to an animatronic model designed to \\'wither\\' as it bled out, enhanced with CGI blood. Winston also sculpted the rough model for the charred remains of Claudia and Madeleine, using archival photographs of victims from Hiroshima for inspiration.\\n\\nPre-screening\\nA rough-cut of Interview was shown to test audiences, who according to producer David Geffen felt \"there was a little too much blood and violence.\" The screenings were held over the objection of Neil Jordan, who was planning on further paring down the length of the film before previewing it, but Geffen wanted to show the longer version in order to \"get a feel for what the audience wanted.\" Eventually about 20 minutes\\' worth of footage was either cut or re-arranged before the theatrical version was ready.\\n\\nRelease\\nBox office\\nInterview with the Vampire was a box-office success. The film opened on November 11, 1994 (Veterans Day) and opening weekend grosses amounted to $36.4 million, a November record, placing it in the number one position at the US box office above The Santa Clause which opened with $19.3 million. However, some in the industry disputed the figure and the range of estimates by others were from $34 to $37 million. In subsequent weeks it struggled against Star Trek Generations and The Santa Clause. Total gross in the United States was $105 million, while the worldwide gross was $224 million, with an estimated budget of $60 million.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews among film critics. Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports the film as holding an overall 64% approval rating based on 55 reviews, with a rating average of 6/10. The site\\'s consensus reads: \"Despite lacking some of the book\\'s subtler shadings, and suffering from some clumsy casting, Interview with the Vampire benefits from Neil Jordan\\'s atmospheric direction and a surfeit of gothic thrills.\" The film holds a 59/100 on Metacritic from 19 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.Praise from The New York Times\\' Elvis Mitchell and the Chicago Sun-Times\\' Roger Ebert was tempered by poor reviews by The Washington Post\\'s Rita Kempley and Desson Howe and Time magazine\\'s Richard Corliss.Oprah Winfrey famously walked out of an advance screening for the movie only 10 minutes in, because of the gore and dark themes. She even considered cancelling an interview with Tom Cruise promoting the film, stating that \"I believe there are forces of light and darkness in the world, and I don\\'t want to be a contributor to the force of darkness.\"\\n\\nYear-end lists\\n4th – Sandi Davis, The Oklahoman\\n6th – David Stupich, The Milwaukee Journal\\nTop 10 (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Steve Murray, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\\nTop 5 runners-up (not ranked) – Scott Schuldt, The Oklahoman\\nTop 10 runner-ups (not ranked) – Janet Maslin, The New York Times\\nHonorable mention – Mike Clark, USA Today\\nHonorable mention –  Glenn Lovell, San Jose Mercury News\\nHonorable mention – Betsy Pickle, Knoxville News-Sentinel\\nHonorable mention – Dan Craft, The Pantagraph\\n1st worst – John Hurley, Staten Island Advance\\n1st worst – Jeff Simon, The Buffalo News\\nDishonorable mention – William Arnold, Seattle Post-Intelligencer\\n\\nAwards\\nHome media\\nThe film was released on VHS on November 21, 1995, and LaserDisc on June 6, 1996, DVD in 1997 and on Blu-ray Disc on October 7, 2008.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe film\\'s musical score was written by Elliot Goldenthal and received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score.

The film was negatively received by critics, and Rice dismissed it completely as she felt the filmmakers had \"mutilated\" her work. During pre-production, Rice had pleaded with the studio not to produce a film of the book just yet as she believed her readers wanted a film based on the second book in the series, The Vampire Lestat. Rice was refused the cooperation of the studio.In February 2012, a film adaptation of The Tale of the Body Thief, the fourth book in the series, entered development with Brian Grazer and Ron Howard\\'s film production company, Imagine Entertainment. It was reported that screenwriter Lee Patterson was going to pen the screenplay. However, Rice\\'s son, Christopher, apparently had drafted a screenplay based on the novel that was met with praise from those involved in the developmental stage. Rice later confirmed that creative differences that were beyond those involved resulted in the dismissal of the project in April 2013.In August 2014 Universal Pictures acquired the rights to the entire Vampire Chronicles. Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have been named as producers and the deal includes the aforementioned screenplay for The Tale of the Body Thief, written by Christopher.A new film adaptation of the book has been written by Josh Boone and was announced in May 2016, with Boone suggesting actor Jared Leto play the role of Lestat. In November 2016, all plans for a theatrical reboot were scrapped as Rice announced she had regained the rights to her novels and intends to create a television series starting with The Vampire Lestat.\\n\\nSee also\\nVampire films\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nInterview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles at IMDb\\nInterview with the Vampire at Box Office Mojo\\nInterview with the Vampire at Rotten Tomatoes\\nInterview with the Vampire at Metacritic',\n",
              " 'Jack Nicholson': 'John Joseph Nicholson (born April 22, 1937) is an American actor and filmmaker whose career has spanned more than 60 years. He is known for having played a wide range of starring and supporting roles, including comic characters, romantic leads, anti-heroes, and villains. In many of his films, he played the \"eternal outsider, the sardonic drifter\", someone who rebels against the social structure.Nicholson\\'s most known and celebrated films include the road drama Easy Rider (1969); the dramas Five Easy Pieces (1970) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest (1975); the comedy-dramas Carnal Knowledge (1971),  The Last Detail (1973), Terms of Endearment (1983), Prizzi\\'s Honor (1985), As Good as It Gets (1997), and About Schmidt (2002); the neo-noir mysteries Chinatown (1974) and The Pledge (2001); the horror film The Shining (1980); the biopic Reds (1981); the fantasy comedy The Witches of Eastwick (1987); the superhero film Batman (1989); the legal drama A Few Good Men (1992); the romantic horror film Wolf (1994); the science fiction comedy Mars Attacks! (1996); the comedy Anger Management (2003); the romantic comedy Something\\'s Gotta Give (2003); and the crime drama The Departed (2006). He has also directed three films, including The Two Jakes (1990).\\nNicholson\\'s 12 Academy Award nominations make him the most nominated male actor in the Academy\\'s history. He has won the Academy Award for Best Actor twice, once for One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest (1975) and once for As Good as It Gets (1997). He also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Terms of Endearment (1983). He is one of only three male actors to win three Academy Awards, and one of only two actors to be nominated for an Academy Award for acting in every decade from the 1960s to the 2000s. He has won six Golden Globe Awards and received the Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. In 1994, at 57, he became one of the youngest actors to be awarded the American Film Institute\\'s Life Achievement Award.\\n\\nEarly life\\nNicholson was born on April 22, 1937, in Neptune City, New Jersey, the son of a showgirl, June Frances Nicholson (stage name June Nilson; 1918–1963). Nicholson\\'s mother was of Irish, English, German, and Welsh descent. She married Italian-American showman Donald Furcillo (stage name Donald Rose) in 1936, before realizing that he was already married. Biographer Patrick McGilligan stated in his book Jack\\'s Life that Latvian-born Eddie King (originally Edgar A. Kirschfeld), June\\'s manager, may have been Nicholson\\'s biological father, rather than Furcillo. Other sources suggest June Nicholson was unsure of the father\\'s identity. As June was only seventeen years old and unmarried, her parents agreed to raise Nicholson as their own child without revealing his true parentage, and June would act as his sister.In 1974, Time magazine researchers learned, and informed Nicholson, that his \"sister\", June, was actually his mother, and his other \"sister\", Lorraine, was really his aunt. By this time, both his mother and grandmother had died (in 1963 and 1970, respectively). On finding out, Nicholson said it was \"a pretty dramatic event, but it wasn\\'t what I\\'d call traumatizing ... I was pretty well psychologically formed\".Nicholson grew up in Neptune City. He was raised in his mother\\'s Roman Catholic church. Before starting high school, his family moved to an apartment in Spring Lake, New Jersey. \"When Jack was ready for high school, the family moved once more—this time two miles farther south to old-money Spring Lake, New Jersey\\'s so-called Irish Riviera, where Ethel May set up her beauty parlor in a rambling duplex at 505 Mercer Avenue.\" \"Nick\", as he was known to his high school friends, attended nearby Manasquan High School, where he was voted \"Class Clown\" by the Class of 1954. He was in detention every day for a whole school year. A theatre and a drama award at the school are named in his honor. In 2004, Nicholson attended his 50-year high school reunion accompanied by his aunt Lorraine.\\n\\nMilitary service\\nIn 1957, Nicholson joined the California Air National Guard, a move he sometimes characterized as an effort to \"dodge the draft\"; the Korean War–era\\'s Military Selective Service Act was still in force, and draftees were required to perform up to two years of active duty. After completing the Air Force\\'s basic training at Lackland Air Force Base, Nicholson performed weekend drills and two-week annual training as a firefighter assigned to the unit based at the Van Nuys Airport. During the Berlin Crisis of 1961, Nicholson was called up for several months of extended active duty, and he was discharged at the end of his enlistment in 1962.\\n\\nCareer\\nEarly work\\nNicholson first came to Hollywood in 1954, when he was seventeen, to visit his sister. He took a job as an office worker for animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera at the MGM cartoon studio. They offered him an entry-level job as an animator, but he declined, citing his desire to become an actor. While accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 56th Golden Globe Awards, he recalled that his first day as a working actor was May 5, 1955, which he considered lucky, as \"5\" was the jersey number of his boyhood idol, Joe DiMaggio.\\nHe trained to be an actor with a group called the Players Ring Theater, after which he found small parts performing on the stage and in TV soap operas. He made his film debut in a low-budget teen drama The Cry Baby Killer (1958), playing the title role. For the following decade, Nicholson was a frequent collaborator with the film\\'s producer, Roger Corman. Corman directed Nicholson on several occasions, such as in The Little Shop of Horrors, as masochistic dental patient and undertaker Wilbur Force, and also in The Raven; The Terror, where he plays a French officer seduced by an evil ghost; and The St. Valentine\\'s Day Massacre.\\nNicholson also frequently worked with director Monte Hellman on low-budget westerns, though two in particular—Ride in the Whirlwind and The Shooting—initially failed to find interest from any US film distributors but gained cult success on the art-house circuit in France and were later sold to television. Nicholson also appeared in two episodes of The Andy Griffith Show. He was also starred as a rebellious trackrace driver in the film The Wild Ride (1960)\\n\\n1960s\\nWith his acting career heading nowhere, Nicholson seemed resigned to a career behind the camera as a writer/director. His first real taste of writing success was the screenplay for the 1967 counterculture film The Trip (directed by Corman), which starred Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper. After first reading the script, Fonda told Nicholson he was totally impressed by the writing and felt it could become a great film. However, Fonda was disappointed with how the film turned out and blamed the editing which turned it into a \"predictable\" film and said so publicly. \"I was livid\", he recalls. Nicholson also co-wrote, with Bob Rafelson, the movie Head, which starred The Monkees, and arranged the movie\\'s soundtrack.\\nNicholson\\'s first big acting break came when a spot opened up in Fonda and Hopper\\'s Easy Rider (1969). He played alcoholic lawyer George Hanson, for which he received his first Oscar nomination. The film cost only $400,000 to make, and became a blockbuster, grossing $40 million. Biographer John Parker states that Nicholson\\'s interpretation of his role placed him in the company of earlier \"anti-hero\" actors, such as James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, while promoting him into an \"overnight number-one hero of the counter-culture movement\".The part was a lucky break for Nicholson. The role had been written for the actor Rip Torn, who withdrew from the project after an argument with Hopper. In interviews, Nicholson later acknowledged the importance of being cast in Easy Rider: \"All I could see in the early films, before Easy Rider, was this desperate young actor trying to vault out of the screen and create a movie career.\"Nicholson was cast by Stanley Kubrick, who was impressed with his role in Easy Rider, in the part of Napoleon in a film about his life, and although production on the film commenced, the project fizzled out, partly due to a change in ownership at MGM, and other issues.\\n\\n1970s\\nNicholson starred in Five Easy Pieces alongside Karen Black in 1970 in what became his persona-defining role. Nicholson and Black were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances. Nicholson played Bobby Dupea, an oil rig worker, and Black played his waitress girlfriend. During an interview about the film, Black noted that Nicholson\\'s character in the film was very subdued, and was very different from Nicholson\\'s real-life personality. She says that the now-infamous restaurant scene was partly improvised by Nicholson, and was out of character for Bobby, who wouldn\\'t have cared enough to argue with a waitress. \"I think that Jack really has very little in common with Bobby. I think Bobby has given up looking for love. But Jack hasn\\'t, he\\'s very interested in love, in finding out things. Jack is a very curious, alive human being. Always ready for a new idea.\" Nicholson himself said as much, telling an interviewer, \"I like listening to everybody. This to me is the elixir of life.\"Black later admitted that she had a crush on Nicholson from the time they met, although they only dated briefly. \"He was very beautiful. He just looked right at you ... I liked him a lot ... He really sort of wanted to date me but I didn\\'t think of him that way because I was going with Peter Kastner ... Then I went to do Easy Rider, but didn\\'t see him because we didn\\'t have any scenes together ... At the premiere, I saw him out in the lobby afterward and I started crying ... He didn\\'t understand that, but what it was was  that I really loved him a lot, and I didn\\'t know it until I saw him again, because it all welled up.\"Within a month after the film\\'s release that September, the movie became a blockbuster, making Nicholson a leading man and the \"new American anti-hero\", according to McDougal. Critics began speculating as to whether he might become another Marlon Brando or James Dean. His career and income skyrocketed. He said, \"I have [become] much sought after. Your name becomes a brand image like a product. You become Campbell\\'s soup, with thirty-one different varieties of roles you can play.\" He told his new agent, Sandy Bresler, to find him unusual roles so he could stretch his acting skill: \"I like to play people that haven\\'t existed yet, a \\'cusp character\\'\", he said:\\n\\nI have that creative yearning. Much in the way Chagall flies figures into the air: once it becomes part of the conventional wisdom, it doesn\\'t seem particularly adventurous or weird or wild.\\n\\nAlso in 1970, he appeared in the movie adaptation of On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, although most of his performance was left on the cutting room floor. His agent turned down a starring role in Deliverance when the film\\'s producer and director, John Boorman, refused to pay what Nicholson\\'s agent wanted.Nicholson starred in Carnal Knowledge in 1971, a comedy-drama directed by Mike Nichols, which co-starred Art Garfunkel, Ann-Margret, and Candice Bergen. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. As a director, Mike Nichols was limited in the actors who he felt could handle the role, saying, \"There is James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Humphrey Bogart, and Henry Fonda. After that, who is there but Jack Nicholson?\" During the filming, Nicholson struck up what became a lifelong friendship with co-star Garfunkel. When he visited Los Angeles, Garfunkel would stay at Nicholson\\'s home in a room Nicholson jokingly called \"the Arthur Garfunkel Suite\".Other Nicholson roles included Hal Ashby\\'s The Last Detail (1973), with Randy Quaid, for which Nicholson won Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival, and he was nominated for his third Oscar and a Golden Globe. Television journalist David Gilmour writes that one of his favorite Nicholson scenes from all his films was—the often censored one—in this film when Nicholson slaps his gun on the bar yelling he was the Shore Patrol. Critic Roger Ebert called it a very good movie, but credited Nicholson\\'s acting as the main reason: \"He creates a character so complete and so complex that we stop thinking about the movie and just watch to see what he\\'ll do next.\"In 1974, Nicholson starred in Roman Polanski\\'s noir thriller Chinatown, and was again nominated for Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Jake Gittes, a private detective. The film co-starred Faye Dunaway and John Huston, and included a cameo role with Polanski. Roger Ebert described Nicholson\\'s portrayal as sharp-edged, menacing, and aggressive, a character who knew \"how to go over the top\", as he did in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest. It is that edge that kept Chinatown from becoming a typical genre crime film. Ebert also notes the importance of the role for Nicholson\\'s career, seeing it as a major transition from the exploitation films of the previous decade. \"As Jake Gittes, he stepped into Bogart\\'s shoes\", says Ebert. \"As a man attractive to audiences because he suggests both comfort and danger ... From Gittes forward, Nicholson created the persona of a man who had seen it all and was still capable of being wickedly amused.\"Nicholson had been friends with the director Roman Polanski long before the murder of Polanski\\'s wife, Sharon Tate and others, at the hands of the Manson Family, and supported him in the days following their deaths. After Tate\\'s death, Nicholson began sleeping with a hammer under his pillow and took breaks from work to attend the Manson trial.\\n\\nIn 1977, three years after Chinatown, Polanski was arrested at Nicholson\\'s home for the sexual assault of 13-year-old Samantha Geimer, who was modeling for Polanski during a magazine photo shoot around the pool. At the time of the incident, Nicholson was out of town making a film, but his steady girlfriend, actress Anjelica Huston, had dropped by unannounced to pick up some items. She heard Polanski in the other room say, \"We\\'ll be right out.\" Polanski then came out with Geimer, and he introduced her to Huston, and they chatted about Nicholson\\'s two large dogs, which were sitting nearby. Huston recalled Geimer was wearing platform heels and appeared quite tall. After a few minutes of talking, Polanski had packed up his camera gear and Huston saw them drive off in his car. Huston told police the next day, after Polanski was arrested, that she \"had witnessed nothing untoward\" and never saw them together in the other room.Geimer learned afterward that Huston herself wasn\\'t supposed to be at Nicholson\\'s house that day, since they had recently broken up, but stopped over to pick up some belongings. Geimer described Nicholson\\'s house as \"definitely\" a guy\\'s house, with lots of wood and shelves crowded with photos and mementos.One of Nicholson\\'s greatest successes came in 1975, with his role as Randle P. McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest. The movie was an adaptation of Ken Kesey\\'s novel, and was directed by Miloš Forman and co-produced by Michael Douglas. Nicholson plays an anti-authoritarian patient at a mental hospital where he becomes an inspiring leader for the other patients. Playing one of the patients was Danny DeVito in an early role. Nicholson learned afterward that DeVito grew up in the same area of New Jersey, and they knew many of the same people. The film swept the Academy Awards with nine nominations, and won the top five, including Nicholson\\'s first for Best Actor.\\nThe role seemed perfect for Nicholson, with biographer Ken Burke noting that his \"smartass demeanor balances his genuine concern for the treatment of his fellow patients with his independent spirit too free to exist in a repressive social structure\". Forman allowed Nicholson to improvise throughout the film, including most of the group therapy sequences.  Reviewer Marie Brenner notes that his bravura performance \"transcends the screen\" and continually inspires the other actors by lightening their mental illnesses with his comic dialogue. She describes his performance:\\n\\nNicholson is everywhere; his energy propels the ward of loonies and makes of them an ensemble, a chorus of people caught in a bummer with nowhere else to go, but still fighting for some frail sense of themselves. ... There are scenes in Cuckoo\\'s Nest that are as intimate—and in their language, twice as rough—as the best moments in The Godfather ... [and] far above the general run of Hollywood performances.\\nAlso in 1975, Nicholson starred in Michelangelo Antonioni\\'s The Passenger (1975), which co-starred Maria Schneider. Nicholson plays the role of a journalist, David Locke, who during an assignment in North Africa decides to quit being a journalist and simply disappear by taking on a new hidden identity. Unfortunately, the dead person whose identity he takes on turns out to have been a weapons smuggler on the run. Antonioni\\'s unusual plot included convincing dialogue and fine acting, states film critic Seymour Chatman. It was shot in Algeria, Spain, Germany, and England.\\nThe film received good reviews and revived Antonioni\\'s reputation as one of cinema\\'s great directors. He says he wanted the film to have more of a \"spy feeling [and] be more political\". Nicholson began shooting the film from an unfinished script, notes Judith Crist, yet upon its completion he thought so highly of the film that he bought the world rights and recorded a reminiscence of working with Antonioni. Critic and screenwriter Penelope Gilliatt provides an overview of Nicholson\\'s role:\\n\\n The Passenger is an unidealized portrait of a drained man whose one remaining stimulus is to push his luck. Again and again, in the movie, we watch him court danger. It interests him to walk the edge of risk. He does it with passivity as if he were taking part in an expressionless game of double-dare with life. Jack Nicholson\\'s performance is a wonder of insight. How to animate a personality that is barely there. \\nHe continued to take more unusual roles. He took a small role in The Last Tycoon, opposite Robert De Niro. He took a less sympathetic role in Arthur Penn\\'s western The Missouri Breaks (1976), specifically to work with Marlon Brando. Nicholson was especially inspired by Brando\\'s acting ability, recalling that in his youth, as an assistant manager at a theater, he watched On the Waterfront about forty times. \"I\\'m part of the first generation that idolized Marlon Brando\", he said.\\nMarlon Brando influenced me strongly. Today, it\\'s hard for people who weren\\'t there to realize the impact that Brando had on an audience. ... He\\'s always been the patron saint of actors.\\nNicholson has observed that while both De Niro and Brando were noted for their skill as method actors, he himself has seldom been described as a method actor, a fact which he sees as an accomplishment: \"I\\'m still fooling them\", he told Sean Penn during a phone conversation. \"I consider it an accomplishment because there\\'s probably no one who understands Method acting better academically than I do—or actually uses it more in his work. But it\\'s funny, nobody really sees that. It\\'s perception versus reality, I guess.\"\\n\\n1980s\\nAlthough he garnered no Academy Award for Stanley Kubrick\\'s adaptation of Stephen King\\'s The Shining (1980), it remains one of his more significant roles. He was Kubrick\\'s first choice to play the lead role, although the book\\'s author, Stephen King, wanted the part played by more of an \"everyman\". However, Kubrick as a director won the argument, and described Nicholson\\'s acting quality as being \"on a par with the greatest stars of the past, like Spencer Tracy and Jimmy Cagney\".On the set, Nicholson always appeared in character, and if Kubrick felt confident that he knew his lines well enough, he encouraged him to improvise and go beyond the script.  For example, Nicholson improvised his now-famous \"Here\\'s Johnny!\" line,  along with a scene in which he unleashes his anger upon his wife while she interrupts his writing.  There were also extensive takes of scenes, due to Kubrick\\'s perfectionism. Nicholson shot a scene with the ghostly bartender thirty-six times. Nicholson states that \"Stanley\\'s demanding. He\\'ll do a scene fifty times, and you have to be good to do that.\"In 1982, he starred as an immigration enforcement agent in The Border, directed by Tony Richardson. It co-starred Warren Oates, who played a corrupt border official. Richardson wanted Nicholson to play his role less expressively than he had in his earlier roles. \"Less is more\", he told him, and wanted him to wear reflecting sunglasses to portray what patrolmen wore.  Richardson recalled that Nicholson worked hard on the set:\\n\\nHe\\'s what the Thirties and Forties stars were like. He can come on the set and deliver, without any fuss, without taking a long time walking around getting into it. \"What do you want? Okay.\" And he just does it straight off. And then if you want him to do it another way on the next take, he can adapt to that too. \\nNicholson won his second Oscar, an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for his role of retired astronaut Garrett Breedlove in Terms of Endearment (1983), directed by James L. Brooks. It starred Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger. McGilligan claims it was one of Nicholson\\'s most complex and unforgettable characters. He and MacLaine played many of their scenes in different ways, constantly testing and making adjustments. Their scenes together gave the film its \"buoyant edge\", states McGilligan, and describes Nicholson\\'s acting as \"Jack floating like a butterfly\". Nicholson continued to work prolifically in the 1980s, starring in such films as: The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981); Reds (1981), where Nicholson portrays the writer Eugene O\\'Neill with a quiet intensity; Prizzi\\'s Honor (1985); Heartburn (1986); The Witches of Eastwick (1987); Broadcast News (1987); and Ironweed (1987). Three Oscar nominations also followed (Reds, Prizzi\\'s Honor, and Ironweed). John Huston, who directed Prizzi\\'s Honor, said of Nicholson\\'s acting, \"He just illuminates the book. He impressed me in one scene after another; the movie is composed largely of first takes with him.\"In the 1989 Batman movie, Nicholson played the psychotic murderer and villain, the Joker. The film was an international smash hit, and a lucrative percentage deal earned him a percentage of the box office gross estimated at $60 million to $90 million. Nicholson said that he was \"particularly proud\" of his performance as the Joker: \"I considered it a piece of pop art\", he said.\\n\\n1990s\\nFor his role as hot-headed Col. Nathan R. Jessup in A Few Good Men (1992), a movie about a murder in a U.S. Marine Corps unit, Nicholson received yet another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. One review describes his performance as \"spellbinding\", adding that he portrayed \"the essence of the quintessential military mindset\". Critic David Thomson notes that Nicholson\\'s character \"blazed and roared\".The film\\'s director, Rob Reiner, recalls how Nicholson\\'s level of acting experience affected the other actors during rehearsals: \"I had the luck of having Jack Nicholson there. He knows what he\\'s doing, and he comes to play, every time out, full-out performance! And what it says to a lot of the other actors is, \\'Oooooh, I better get on my game here because this guy\\'s coming to play! So I can\\'t hold back; I\\'ve got to come up to him.\\' He sets the tone.\"In 1996, Nicholson collaborated once more with Batman director Tim Burton on Mars Attacks!, pulling double duty as two contrasting characters, President James Dale and Las Vegas property developer Art Land. At first, studio executives at Warner Bros. disliked the idea of killing off Nicholson\\'s character, so Burton created two characters and killed them both off.Not all of Nicholson\\'s performances have been well received. He was nominated for Razzie Awards as worst actor for Man Trouble (1992) and Hoffa (1992). However, Nicholson\\'s performance in Hoffa also earned him a Golden Globe nomination. While David Thomson states that the film was terribly neglected, since Nicholson portrayed one of his best screen characters, someone who is \"snarly, dumb, smart, noble, rascally—all the parts of \\'Jack\\'\"Nicholson went on to win his next Academy Award for Best Actor in the romantic comedy, As Good as It Gets (1997), his third film directed by James L. Brooks. He played Melvin Udall, a \"wickedly funny\", mean-spirited, obsessive-compulsive novelist. \"I\\'m a studio Method actor\", he said. \"So I was prone to give some kind of clinical presentation of the disorder.\" His Oscar was matched with the Academy Award for Best Actress for Helen Hunt, who played a Manhattan wisecracking, single-mother waitress drawn into a love/hate friendship with Udall, a frequent diner in the restaurant. The film was a tremendous box office success, grossing $314 million, which made it Nicholson\\'s second-best-grossing film of his career, after Batman.Nicholson admits he initially didn\\'t like playing the role of a middle-aged man alongside a much younger Hunt, seeing it as a movie cliché. \"But Helen disarmed that at the first meeting\", he says, \"and I stopped thinking about it.\" They got along well during the filming, with Hunt saying that he \"treated me like a queen\", and they connected immediately: \"It wasn\\'t even what we said\", she adds. \"It was just some frequency we both could tune into that was very, very compatible.\"Critic Jack Mathews of Newsday described Nicholson as being \"in rare form\", adding that \"it\\'s one of those performances that make you aware how much fun the actor is having\". Author and screenwriter Andrew Horton describes their on-screen relationship as being like \"fire and ice, oil and water—seemingly complete opposites\". Nonetheless, Hunt was Nicholson\\'s perfect counterpart and delivered \"a simply stunning performance\", wrote critic Louise Keller.In 2001, Nicholson was the first actor to receive the Stanislavsky Award at the 23rd Moscow International Film Festival for \"conquering the heights of acting and faithfulness\".\\n\\n2000s\\nIn About Schmidt (2002), Nicholson portrayed a retired Omaha, Nebraska, actuary who questions his own life following his wife\\'s death. His quietly restrained performance earned him an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor. In Anger Management (2003), he played an aggressive therapist assigned to help an overly pacifist man (Adam Sandler). In 2003, Nicholson also starred in Something\\'s Gotta Give, as an aging playboy who falls for the mother (Diane Keaton) of his young girlfriend. In late 2006, Nicholson marked his return to the dark side as Frank Costello, a nefarious Boston Irish Mob boss, based on Whitey Bulger who was still on the run at that time, presiding over Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese\\'s Oscar-winning film The Departed, a remake of Andrew Lau\\'s Infernal Affairs. The role earned Nicholson worldwide critical praise, along with various award wins and nominations, including a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actor.\\nIn 2007, Nicholson co-starred with Morgan Freeman in Rob Reiner\\'s The Bucket List. Nicholson and Freeman portrayed dying men who fulfill their list of goals. In researching the role, Nicholson visited a Los Angeles hospital to see how cancer patients coped with their illnesses.\\n\\n2010s\\nNicholson\\'s next film role saw him reunite with James L. Brooks, director of Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News, and As Good as It Gets, for a supporting role as Paul Rudd\\'s character\\'s father in the 2010 film How Do You Know.\\nIt has been widely reported in subsequent years that Nicholson has retired from acting because of memory loss. In a September 2013 Vanity Fair article, Nicholson said that he did not consider himself retired, merely that he was now less driven to \"be out there anymore\".On February 15, 2015, Nicholson made a special appearance as a presenter on SNL 40, the 40th anniversary special of Saturday Night Live. After the death of boxer Muhammad Ali on June 3, 2016, Nicholson appeared on HBO\\'s The Fight Game with Jim Lampley for an exclusive interview about his friendship with Ali. He was reported to be starring in an English-language remake of Toni Erdmann in 2017 opposite Kristen Wiig, his first feature film role since How Do You Know, but later the project was abandoned by everyone including the director.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nRelationships and children\\nNicholson\\'s only marriage was to Sandra Knight from June 17, 1962, to August 8, 1968; they had been separated for two years prior to the divorce. They had one daughter together, Jennifer (born September 13, 1963), also an actress. Jennifer\\'s son Duke Norfleet (b. 1999), is also an actor, under the name Duke Nicholson.Actress Susan Anspach contended that her son, Caleb Goddard (born September 26, 1970), was fathered by Nicholson. In 1984, Nicholson stated that he was not convinced he is Caleb\\'s father; however, in 1996, Caleb stated that Nicholson had acknowledged him as his son. At some point between 1988 and 1994, Nicholson provided financial assistance to put Caleb through college, and Anspach\\'s New York Times obituary referred to Caleb as \"her son, whose father is Jack Nicholson\".Between April 1973 and January 1990, Nicholson had an on-again, off-again relationship with actress Anjelica Huston that included periods of overlap with other women, including Danish model Winnie Hollman, with whom he fathered a daughter, Honey Hollman (born 1981).From 1989 to 1994, Nicholson had a relationship with actress Rebecca Broussard. They had two children together: daughter Lorraine Nicholson (born April 16, 1990 - named after his aunt), and son Raymond (born February 20, 1992).In the mid 1990\\'s Nicholson had a daughter Tessa with a Ms. Jeannine Gourin.For over a year, from 1999 to 2000, Nicholson dated actress Lara Flynn Boyle; they later reunited, before splitting permanently in 2004.Nicholson has stated that children \"give your life a resonance that it can\\'t have without them ... As a father, I\\'m there all the time. I give unconditional love.\" However, he has also lamented that he \"didn\\'t see enough of my eldest daughter because I was trying to make a career\".\\n\\nAssault charge and lawsuits\\nIn a criminal complaint filed on February 8, 1994, Robert Blank stated that Nicholson, then 56, approached Blank\\'s Mercedes-Benz while he was stopped at a red light in North Hollywood. After accusing the other man of cutting him off in traffic, Nicholson used a golf club to bash the roof and windshield of Blank\\'s car. A witness confirmed Blank\\'s account of the incident, and misdemeanor charges of assault and vandalism were filed against Nicholson. Charges were dropped after Nicholson apologized to Blank, and the two reached an undisclosed settlement, which included a reported $500,000 check from Nicholson.In 1996, a lawsuit was brought against Nicholson for rupturing a woman\\'s breast implants. Later that same year, a second lawsuit was brought against Nicholson alleging that he promised a woman named Catherine Shaheen $1,000 for sex and then assaulted her when she asked for the money. Though Shaheen received a settlement of about $40,000, she argued that this was insufficient to cover the injuries inflicted upon her, including brain trauma, which she stated were \"actually killing her.\"\\n\\nCelebrity friendships\\nNicholson lived next door to Marlon Brando for a number of years on Mulholland Drive in Beverly Hills. Warren Beatty also lived nearby, earning the road the nickname \"Bad Boy Drive\". After Brando\\'s death in 2004, Nicholson purchased his bungalow for $6.1 million, with the purpose of having it demolished. Nicholson stated that it was done out of respect to Brando\\'s legacy, as it had become too expensive to renovate the \"derelict\" building which was plagued by mold.Nicholson\\'s friendship with author-journalist Hunter S. Thompson is described in Thompson\\'s autobiography Kingdom of Fear. Following Thompson\\'s death in 2005, Nicholson and fellow actors Johnny Depp, John Cusack, and Sean Penn attended the private memorial service in Colorado.Nicholson was also a close friend of Robert Evans, the producer of Chinatown, and after Evans lost Woodland, his home, as the result of a 1980s drug bust, Nicholson and other friends of the producer purchased Woodland to give it back to Evans.\\n\\nHobbies\\nNicholson is a fan of the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Lakers. He has been a Laker season ticket holder since 1970, and has held courtside season tickets for the past 25 years next to the opponent\\'s benches both at The Forum and Staples Center, missing very few games. In a few instances, Nicholson has engaged in arguments with game officials and opposing players, and even walked onto the court. He was almost ejected from a Lakers playoff game in May 2003 after he yelled at the game\\'s referee.Nicholson is a collector of 20th-century and contemporary art, including the work of Henri Matisse, Tamara de Lempicka, Andy Warhol and Jack Vettriano. In 1995, artist Ed Ruscha was quoted saying that Nicholson has \"one of the best collections out here\".\\n\\nPolitical views\\nNicholson described himself as a \"life-long Irish Democrat\". Although he is personally against abortion, he is pro-choice. He has said, \"I\\'m pro-choice but against abortion because I\\'m an illegitimate child myself, and it would be hypocritical to take any other position. I\\'d be dead. I wouldn\\'t exist.\" He has also said that he has \"nothing but total admiration, gratitude, and respect for the strength of the women who made the decision they made in my individual case\".In 2020, Nicholson endorsed Bernie Sanders\\'s second presidential campaign for the 2020 nomination.\\n\\nReligious views\\nDuring a 1992 Vanity Fair interview, Nicholson stated, \"I don\\'t believe in God now. I can still work up an envy for someone who has faith. I can see how that could be a deeply soothing experience.\"\\n\\nHonors\\nIn May 2008, then-California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced that Nicholson would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. The induction ceremony took place on December 15, 2008, where he was inducted alongside 11 other Californians.In 2010, Nicholson was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.In 2011, Nicholson received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Brown University at its 243rd commencement. At the ceremony, Ruth Simmons, Brown University\\'s president, called him \"the most skilled actor of our lifetime\".\\n\\nAwards and nominations\\nWith twelve Academy Award nominations (eight for Best Actor and four for Best Supporting Actor), Nicholson is the most nominated male actor in Academy Awards history. Only Nicholson (1960s–2000s), Michael Caine (1960s–2000s), Meryl Streep (1970s–2010s), Paul Newman (1950s–1960s, 1980s–2000s), Katharine Hepburn (1930s–1960s, 1980s), and Laurence Olivier (1930s–1970s) have been nominated for an acting (lead or supporting) Academy Award in five different decades.\\nWith three Oscar wins, he also ties with Walter Brennan, Daniel Day-Lewis, Ingrid Bergman, and Meryl Streep for the second-most Oscar wins in acting categories. Only Katharine Hepburn, with four Oscars, won more.\\nIn 2013, Nicholson co-presented the Academy Award for Best Picture with First Lady Michelle Obama. This ceremony marked the eighth time he has presented the Academy Award for Best Picture (1972, 1977, 1978, 1990, 1993, 2006, 2007, and 2013). Nicholson is an active and voting member of the Academy.\\n\\nFilmography\\nNicholson\\'s acting career spans over sixty years.

              " 'Jack Reacher': 'Jack Reacher is a fictional character and the protagonist of a series of crime thriller novels by British author Lee Child. After leaving the US Army as a major in its military police at age 36, Reacher roams the United States taking odd jobs and investigating suspicious and frequently dangerous situations. As of 27 October 2020, 25 novels have been published, the most recent being The Sentinel. The character has also appeared in short stories, and two of the novels have been adapted into successful action thriller films, starring Tom Cruise as Reacher.\\n\\nDevelopment and author\\'s commentary\\nDevelopment\\nAt the time Lee Child sat down to write his first novel Killing Floor, he was unemployed, having been made redundant from his position as a presentation director for Granada Television. According to Child, authorship was a purely pragmatic decision: \"I wasn\\'t one of these people that felt compelled to write. It had to keep a roof over our heads, so it was totally, totally 110% commercially motivated.\"Critics have perceived other influences in Jack Reacher\\'s creation. Bob Cornwell quotes Lee Child\\'s reply in another interview as having created Reacher \"as an antidote, to all the depressed and miserable alcoholics that increasingly peopled the genre\". Similarly, editor Otto Penzler published an essay by Child explaining that Jack Reacher was created deliberately in contrast to the prevailing trends in crime fiction. His name is short and commonplace, as opposed to quirky or unusual; Reacher\\'s  personal ethics and wandering lifestyle are reminiscent of the chivalrous knight errant of medieval lore as opposed to an anti-hero tormented by addiction and haunted by past misbehavior.The character\\'s name first came to Child in a supermarket when an old lady, noting the span of Child\\'s arms, asked for his help in reaching out to a can of pears. On seeing this, Child\\'s wife commented that if his writing career did not work out he could \"always get a job as a reacher in a supermarket\". Reacher\\'s ex-military background was a specific and tactical choice on his behalf. Child has explained, \"I thought that I would do a book that\\'s not the same as everybody else\\'s. Everybody else had their guy working: a private guy in Boston or a police lieutenant in L.A., or wherever. I thought, \\'Well, he won\\'t be working, and he won\\'t live anywhere, and let\\'s just take it from there.\\'\" Child also felt that this origin would lend itself to the character\\'s personality and nomadic lifestyle: \"This idea of the rootless alienation has got to come from somewhere, and I noticed that the most alienated people are always ex-military, because it\\'s like going from one solar system to the other, it\\'s so different. So that was an easy choice: Make him ex-military. Then make him ex-military police because, broadly speaking, these would be crime novels, and he had to have some investigative experience, and he had to understand procedures and forensics and so on. So that part was all set in stone\".\\n\\nSimilarities between Reacher and Lee Child\\nNumerous critics have pointed out the various similarities between Lee Child and Jack Reacher. Bryan Curtis, writing for Grantland, and Natasha Harding and Caroline Iggulden, in a separate article for The Sun, have brought out the various similarities between Child and Reacher: Child is 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) tall while his protagonist stands  6 ft 5 in (1.96 m); both writer and creation constantly consume coffee; Like Reacher, Child \"lives in cheap pairs of jeans and T-shirts and finds the idea of buying expensive clothes to be irrational\"; and that \"Jack Reacher\\'s famous physical qualities are based on Child\\'s playground memories as a child\". Child tends to agree with such observations: \"I was huge as a kid and Reacher\\'s stature is me translated as a kid. I enjoyed being bigger and fighting shamelessly. I\\'ve done a fair amount of headbutting. It\\'s an awesome manoeuvre.\" Andy Martin notes that \"just as Reacher is half-Rimbaud, half-Rambo, Child is both art-for-art\\'s-sake Parnassian and ruthless businessman.\"Curtis, as well as Harding and Iggulden, have also considered the role Child\\'s dismissal from Granada had on Reacher\\'s development. Curtis also notes that \"Child created Reacher from the smoldering embers of his own rage. It might seem like a simplistic theory, but it\\'s true. Like the author, Reacher was workplace surplus: He was a military policeman in an era of Army downsizing. The act of leaving his job turned Reacher into a protective figure, an avenging angel.\" He finds that Reacher\\'s actions are a manifestation of Child\\'s anger at his sacking and that his violent ways of dealing with villains is \\'cathartic\\' to the author.\\n\\nAuthor\\'s commentary and interpretation\\nChild views Jack Reacher as a \"happy-go-lucky guy. He has quirks and problems, but the thing is, he doesn\\'t know he\\'s got them. Hence, no tedious self-pity. He\\'s smart and strong, an introvert, but any anguish he suffers is caused by others.\" When asked about the casting of Tom Cruise in the role of Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise\\'s casting as Jack Reacher was met with severe criticism from fans of the book series, primarily because the disparity in their heights with Reacher portrayed as a blond, 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall, 250-pound man in the novels, while Cruise is a 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall brunette), Child replied that \"Reacher\\'s size in the books is a metaphor for an unstoppable force\". Physically and appearance wise, Child has compared him to Rugby Player Lawrence Dallaglio.He has also referred to Reacher on multiple occasions as a \\'knight-errant\\' and in an interview for the Time magazine describes the character as: \" (He\\'s) two things in one. On the surface, he is an ex-military cop who is suddenly dumped out into the civilian world. He doesn\\'t fit in, and he spends his time wandering America, seeing the things that he\\'s never had time to see before. He\\'s trying to stay out of trouble, but masterfully once a year getting into trouble. He\\'s also the descendant of a very ancient tradition: the noble loner, the knight errant, the mysterious stranger, who has shown up in stories forever… He is a truly universal character... I\\'m writing the modern iteration of a character who has existed for thousands of years.\"In another interview for Esquire magazine, Child further analyses the mythology of his character:\\n\\nThe stories that I love are basically about the knight-errant, the mysterious stranger. And the reason why people think that\\'s an essentially American paradigm is the Westerns. The Westerns were absolutely rock solid with that stuff. You know, the mysterious rider comes in off the range, sorts out the problem, and rides off into the sunset. It is just such a total paradigm, but not invented in America. That was imported from the medieval tales of Europe. The knight-errant: literally a knight, somehow banished and forced to wander the land doing good deeds. It\\'s part of storytelling in every culture. Japan has it with the ronin myth; every culture has this Robin Hood idea. So really, that character was forced out of Europe as Europe became more densely populated and more civilized. That character no longer had stories in Europe; it had to migrate to where the frontier was still open and dangerous, which was America, essentially. So the character, I think, is actually universal and historic, most recently, normally represented in America. I think the Westerns saw it firmly adopted by America, so yeah, right now, we think of this as a completely American character, but really, it\\'s more historic than that. But I\\'m very happy to have that reference made. \\nChild also views Reacher as \"post-feminist\" stating that he does not parlay in \"gender distinction...Reacher likes strong, realistic women, and he treats women with respect...he doesn\\'t cut them any slack, but also he has no negative preconceptions. If you\\'re a woman, he will be your friend; but if necessary, he will kill you.\"\\n\\nFictional biography\\nJack Reacher is described as being a former major in the United States Army Military Police Corps.\\n\\nChildhood and formative years\\nJack Reacher was born on a military base in Berlin, on 29 October 1960. He has no middle name, and most people simply call him \\'Reacher\\', even his family as a child. Regular references are made to the fact that Reacher\\'s given name is Jack, which is not a nickname for John, and that he has no middle name.  His military record officially refers to him as Jack (none) Reacher. From the time he was a boy, his family, even his mother, simply called him \"Reacher\", an appellation that has stayed with him, but was never given to his brother.Reacher\\'s mother Josephine Moutier Reacher (née Moutier) was a French national, and Reacher was fluent in French from early childhood, but as he admits in The Affair (2011) he speaks the language Un peu, mais lentement (\"A little, but slowly\"). Reacher\\'s maternal grandfather was at the Battle of Verdun in the First World War and in the French Resistance in the Second, and lived to a ripe old age, which in Reacher\\'s view means that his grandfather had \"beaten the odds\".\\n\\nMilitary years and profile\\nAfter being shunted around the world, growing up on U.S. military bases where his father Stan was stationed, he gained an education in basic survival as well as an opportunity to enter the United States Military Academy at West Point. After four years at West Point (1979 to 1983) Reacher achieved the ranks of 2nd lieutenant, 1st lieutenant, captain, and major, including an intervening demotion from major to captain in 1990 during his tenure in the military police. His commanding officer, Leon Garber, promoted Reacher twice in 18 months, making  him the youngest peacetime major anyone could remember. During his tenure, his achievements were recognised in the form of citations and awards including the Silver Star, the Defense Superior Service Medal, two Legions of Merit, Soldier\\'s Medal,  Bronze Star, Army Commendation Medal, and a second Silver Star and Purple Heart for wounds sustained in the bombing of the US Marine Corps barracks in Beirut in 1983.While his Silver Star and Purple Heart are cited on his profile, all of the other medal citations involve official secrets and are therefore redacted. The short story \"Deep Down\" hints that he possibly was awarded the Legion of Merit as a result of exposing a female liaison officer who was leaking confidential information to the Soviet Union.Reacher served in the army\\'s military police branch, resigning his commission and mustering out at the rank of major. His unit, the fictional 110th Special Investigations Unit, was formed to handle exceptionally tough cases. He left the armed forces in 1997, partly due to a reduction in the forces and partly because he verbally offended a lieutenant colonel during an investigation in Mississippi, who then singled him out for discharge.Among his formal qualifications, Reacher is described as the only non-Marine to win the Wimbledon Cup, a US Marine Corps 1000 Yard Invitational Rifle Competition; achieving a record score in 1988. Anecdotally his fitness reports rated him well above average in the classroom, excellent in the field, fluently bilingual in English and French, passable in Spanish, outstanding on all man-portable weaponry, and beyond outstanding at hand-to-hand combat.\\n\\nLater years\\nAfter leaving the Army, Reacher became a drifter, his only baggage a folding toothbrush, although after the September 11 attacks, with restrictions on wire transfers in the light of fraud he is obliged to carry an ATM card and photo ID in the form of a (generally expired) American passport.Emily Sargent, while conducting an interview with Lee Child, describes Reacher\\'s post-military life as follows:\\n\\nYou will never find Reacher going to the laundry or doing the ironing. When his clothes get dirty he simply goes to the local hardware store and buys a functional pair of chinos and a workman\\'s shirt and stuffs the old ones in the bin. No mortgage, no wife, no ties, he is a perfectly free agent, unlimited and unbound, incapable of ever settling down.\\nLee Child describes Reacher\\'s obsession to wander about:\\n\\nHe\\'s an ex-military policeman, and he was demobilized in his middle thirties after having served all of his adult life in the [U.S.] Army and having grown up on Marine bases, because his father was a Marine. The idea was to have a character that was plausibly rootless. Most people who are wanderers do it for other reasons—they are mentally ill, or something like that. Reacher is completely competent, but he\\'s just habituated to this fragmented life in the military, so he can\\'t settle into civilian society. The idea of staying anywhere for more than a few days is anathema to him.\\n\\nDemeanor and personality\\nReacher himself expounds on a hypothesis about this vagrant life-style in Never Go Back. He states that he has a genetic disposition towards roaming about, citing the British Empire, the Vikings, and the Polynesians as groups with a similar wanderlust. While he accepts that there was an economical necessity behind their voyages, he maintains that \"some of them could not stop\". He feels that long ago when humans lived in small bands, there was a risk of inbreeding as a result of which a gene developed over the course of evolution such that \"every generation and every small band had at least one person who had to wander\". This would lead to \"mixing up of gene pools\" and would be \"healthier all around\". Reacher concludes:\\n\\nI think ninety-nine of us grow up to love the campfire, and one grows up to hate it. Ninety-nine of us grow up to fear the howling wolf, and one grows up to envy it. And I\\'m that guy.\\nCompelled to spread his DNA worldwide. Purely for the good of the species.\\nReacher\\'s large physique means his character is sometimes mistaken by other people. For example, in Die Trying, Reacher is wrongly suspected by the FBI of being involved in a kidnapping, which assesses him (solely on the basis of a few photos) as such: \"The big guy is different. Different clothes, different stance, different physically. He could be foreign, at least partly, or maybe second generation. Fair hair and blue eyes, but there\\'s something in his face. Maybe he\\'s European, perhaps a European mercenary or terrorist.\" Reacher is aware of this perception. In Make Me Reacher gets off a train in a remote town called Mother\\'s Rest, simply because he likes the name of the town. When he sees a woman approaching him with a look of expectation, he immediately understands that the person she was waiting for must be very tall like him, as it is his standout feature when people first meet him.\\nIn Echo Burning, Reacher narrates how he first turned \"his fear into aggression\". He was about four when he watched a television show on space adventures. One episode depicted a space monster which then terrified the young Reacher. He was unable to sleep for days, thinking the monster was under his bed and would get him if he tried to sleep. According to Reacher, he then became angry: \"Not at myself for being afraid, because as far as I was concerned the thing was totally real and I should be afraid. I got mad at the thing for making me afraid. For threatening me\". Reacher then one night \"kind of exploded with fury\". In his words, Reacher \"raced down the monster\" and successfully changed his fear into fury. He also stated he has never been scared since.This fact is later referenced in Never Go Back, when an Army psychological study of fear in children is cited that shows Reacher to have abnormally fast reflexes and aggression levels at the age of six; Reacher believes that this abnormal level of aggression at that age is not due to genetics, as the Army report suggested, but because he got tired of being frightened, and trained himself \"to turn fear into aggression, automatically\".Reacher seldom shows remorse for the numerous felonies he perpetrates and has a primal sense of justice. In Personal, after killing a thug, he defends his actions to his distraught accomplice, Casey Nice, by stating the man could have spent his life performing good deeds such as \"helping old ladies across the street\", \"raising funds for Africa\" or \"volunteering in the library\". Instead the man extorted money and hurt people and when he \"finally he opened the wrong door, what came out at him was his problem, not mine\".This primitivity on the part of Reacher is commented upon in Never Go Back, in which Reacher is described by Susan Turner as being like \"something feral....It\\'s like you\\'ve been sanded down to nothing but yes and no, and you and them, and black and white, and live or die. You\\'re like a predator. Cold and hard.\" (p. 176–177) However, when she witnesses Reacher\\'s outrage at the hurt inflicted upon an innocent waitress, she reconsiders and states that he is actually not feral as she had earlier presumed. Furthermore, she notes that Reacher had until then attempted to solve only her problems, neglecting the problems of his own:\\n\\n And you\\'ve done nothing but chip away at my problem. You\\'re ignoring your own, with the Big Dog. Which is just as serious. Therefore, you still care for others. Which means you can\\'t really be feral. I imagine caring for others is the first thing to go. And you still know right from wrong. Which all means you\\'re OK.\\nThis underlying kindness perceived by Turner is visible in many of Reacher\\'s actions: he stands up for the right of women in both Echo Burning, whose central plot involves him aiding a woman\\'s escape from her abusive husband, and in Worth Dying For, in which he breaks the nose of an abusive husband for beating up his wife. He is also shown to be sympathetic to those in need, as seen in The Hard Way where he bequeaths Edward Lane\\'s fees paid to him for the medical treatment and living expenses of a man whom Lane had betrayed many years back.This point is further elucidated in Personal, when Reacher reminisces while standing at his mother\\'s grave:\\n\\nShe had said, \\'You\\'ve got the strength of two normal boys. What are you going to do with it?\\' I hadn\\'t replied. Our silence was part of the ritual. She answered for me. She said, \\'You\\'re going to do the right thing.\\' And I had tried, mostly, which had sometimes caused me trouble, and sometimes won me medals of my own.\\n\\nSkills\\nReacher is described as proficient in hand-to-hand combat. He is quite fast for his height, and often fights opponents his size or larger. His skill is attributed to the fact that he grew up all over the world, due to being in a Marine Corps family. While he is not a master in any one form of combat, he tends to incorporate moves from various styles. His favorite moves are headbutts, elbow strikes, and kicks to the groin. As Child once put it, \"Reacher\\'s fighting style is like a running chainsaw\". Reacher generally goes with the flow of the fight, caring about winning more than how he wins. However, he plans out how to strike first or react to the first strike, and how he\\'ll make sure the other person never fights him again. As he puts it, \"The other guy cares how he wins, I care about pissing on the other guy\\'s grave.\"\\nReacher has an internal clock. He sets a time to wake up at and his body automatically awakens. He often sets a timer in fights to try and get a tactical edge. Reacher also has a fascination with numbers. In Bad Luck and Trouble, Reacher uses this to deduce that the amount of money deposited without his knowledge into his bank account was an attempt by Neagley, his colleague from the Military Police Corps, to contact him.\\nReacher has extremely acute deduction skills. He generally gains his information simply from talking to people or making minute observations. He will pick up on a simple pause and relate it back to what he is trying figure out. He is known as one of the best investigators the Military Police Corps had to offer, and he led a special unit tasked with difficult cases.\\nReacher is also described as a skilled marksman, principally in One Shot, being the only non-Marine to win the US Marine Corps 1000 Yard Invitational rifle competition.\\n\\nHabits and beliefs\\nReacher has a love for music, especially blues. It was this affinity that inspires Reacher to get off the bus at the start of Killing Floor, and in the same novel reveals that he has a music collection in his head, replaying tracks as he travels without needing the technology others seem to be obsessed with and burdened by. Reacher explains this to detectives investigating an early morning suicide on a near-deserted New York subway near a visit to a blues club on Bleecker Street.Reacher espouses no personal religious beliefs but is scathing in his dismissal of town boss Thurman\\'s fundamentalist Christian position in the novel Nothing to Lose: When asked if he is \"born again\" Reacher says, \"Once was enough for me\" and later rhetorically asks Thurman, \"I\\'m here to visit the sick and you want to have me beaten up? What kind of Christian are you?\" He also mentions at the opening of Bad Luck and Trouble that he avoids Alaska Airlines because \"they put a scripture card on the meal trays\".Reacher is also critical of the corruption of traditional spelling, such as the use of contractions like \"U\" for \"you\", \"lo\" for \"low\", disliking the absence of the apostrophe in DONT WALK pedestrian signage before they were replaced, then noting he also disapproved of replacing words with pictures.While Reacher knows how to drive, in A Wanted Man he professes to be a bad driver, and in Bad Luck and Trouble he says he cannot rent a car because he does not have a driver\\'s license. In Without Fail Agent Frolich trawls various databases for Reacher, only to discover he is effectively untraceable, because without a driver\\'s license he has no photograph and no address.Among his few indulgences are casual sex and coffee, which he drinks constantly.\\n\\nPhysical appearance\\nBryan Curtis, in an interview with Lee Child, describes Reacher thus:\\n\\nHis face looked like it had been chipped out of rock by a sculptor who had ability but not much time.\\nFrom A Wanted Man: \"He was one of the largest men she had ever seen outside the NFL. He was extremely tall, and extremely broad, and long-armed, and long-legged. The lawn chair was regular size, but it looked tiny under him. It was bent and crushed out of shape. His knuckles were nearly touching the ground. His neck was thick and his hands were the size of dinner plates...A wild man. But not really. Underneath everything else seemed strangely civilized....His gaze was both wise and appealing, both friendly and bleak, both frank and utterly cynical.\"Reacher is described as being 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) tall, weighing 210–250 pounds (95–113 kg) and having a 50-inch (130 cm) chest. In Never Go Back, he is described as having \"a six-pack like a cobbled city street, a chest like a suit of NFL armor, biceps like basketballs, and subcutaneous fat like a Kleenex tissue.\" In his youth, his physical appearance was likened to that of a \\'bulked-up greyhound\\'. He also reveals that his size is purely genetic; he states in Persuader and Never Go Back that he is not much of an exercise enthusiast.He has various scars, most notably a collection of roughly stitched scars on his abdomen caused by a bombing in Lebanon, with ugly raised welts that are later instrumental in saving his life, a 3-to-4-inch-wide (8 to 10 cm) white scar that intersects his shrapnel scar that he received during a knife fight in Gone Tomorrow. Reacher attributes his survival to the rough MASH stitch work.His various other scars include one from a chest shot with a .38 Special. and a powder burn from a near-miss at point blank range, and one on his arm where his brother struck him with a chisel.He suffers his first ever broken nose in Worth Dying For, at over 50 years of age.  He resets the bone with a thump from his palm and later puts on a plaster bandage made of duct tape.\\n\\nFamily\\nReacher\\'s maternal grandfather, Laurent Moutier, was a furniture restorer in Paris, who, at age 30, volunteered for the French Army in 1914 at the outbreak of World War I, fighting at Verdun and The Somme. Between 1919 and 1929 he was commissioned to produce wooden legs for wounded veterans. Josephine Moutier was his only child. He died in 1974 at age 90. Jack, as a boy, met him three times and is described as having liked him. In Second Son Reacher is impressed with his grandfather\\'s stoic acceptance of approaching death and says that \"A man who survived Verdun and The Somme as well as the WWII anti-Nazi Resistance has already beaten the odds\".\\nReacher\\'s mother, Josephine Moutier Reacher, born in France, was 30 years old when Reacher was born. She met Reacher\\'s father in Korea and married him in the Netherlands. When she was only 13, she joined the French Resistance and under the alias \"Beatrice\" worked with Le Chemin de Fer Humain (the Human Railroad), saving 80 men. She garroted a schoolmate, a boy who threatened to give her up to the Nazis, and would later receive the Médaille de la Résistance (the Resistance Medal) for further heroism. She was widowed in 1988, and died in 1990 at the age of 60 of lung cancer. Reacher described his mother as \"gallic, feminine, obstinate,\" and \"[the] most stubborn woman possible.\" He also branded her a fatalist as she had concealed her cancer from her children and had refused treatment for a one-year period before her death. However Reacher compares her favourably to his father: \"My father hadn\\'t killed the enemy at the age of thirteen. But my mother had. She had lived through desperate times and she had stepped up and done what was necessary.\" Reacher also has great respect for his mother: at her funeral he buried his Silver Star medal with her, and on learning of her role in World War II, states that he became the man he was because of her. In Die Trying, when the FBI mistakenly assumes Reacher to be in league with the book\\'s villains, the Bureau experts observing Reacher\\'s demeanor on footage from a security camera consider him to be \"a foreigner, probably a European mercenary\".\\nReacher\\'s father, Stan Reacher, was a United States Marine Corps captain, who served in Korea and Vietnam. His military service kept his family continually moving all around the world to various military bases. At the time of the short story Second Son, when Jack was 13, he was stationed in Okinawa and involved in preparing contingency plans for an invasion of Mainland China. In the same short story, Stan Reacher is depicted as \"a child of the depression,\" coming from a miserly New England family, and as a result was a proponent of the theories of \"Waste not, want not,\" \"Make do and mend,\" and \"Don\\'t make an exhibition of oneself.\"  Jack described his father as \"a plain New Hampshire Yankee with an implacable horror of anything fancy...he had no use for wealth and excess. Very compartmentalized guy. Gentle, shy, sweet, loving man, but a stone-cold killer. Next to him I look like Liberace\". Jack Reacher furthermore highlighted this dichotomy in his father\\'s behaviour by stating that he would be engaging in violent actions such as \"how to angle a claymore mine so the little ball bearings explode outward at exactly the right angle to rip the enemy\\'s spines out of their backs with maximum efficiency\" one day, and the next day would be doing something calmer, like \"watching birds,\" After military service, \"there was no place left for people like him.\" He died in 1988. James Stanfield, in an article concludes that \"Reacher clearly looked up to and idolised his father, and though Reacher\\'s reasons for leaving the service were very different to his dad\\'s, they\\'ve ended up at the same point.\"Reacher had only one sibling, brother Joe Reacher, who was two years older than Jack. Physically, Joe was one inch taller 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) and a \"little slighter\" than his younger sibling, weighing 220 pounds (100 kg). Joe was born on a military base in the Philippines, and Jack is described as helping Joe beat up the kids who gave him trouble in school, and vice versa. However Joe also had scuffles with his own brother, given the scar that Jack had put on his forehead during their childhood. Joe was also a West Point graduate, and spent five years in military intelligence, where he never won any of the \"good medals\", only the \"junk awards. \"Jack described his brother as being pedantic, and called him a perfectionist, \"a man horrified with anything less than the best.\" Joe is described as joining the US Treasury Department, and died at age 38 in the line of duty, having arranged a meeting with a potential investigation subject. Because he was killed in the line of duty, his name can be found on the Treasury Department\\'s Roll of Honor..\\nWhile making an analogy in The Affair, Reacher claims to know his paternal grandfather and have many cousins. However, Past Tense, establishes that Reacher hasn\\'t met anyone in his father\\'s family when he visits the town his father came from. During the events of Past Tense, Reacher meets three distant cousins of him, one of whom, Mark Reacher, is involved in a murderous criminal conspiracy, with their distant relation not compelling Reacher to show him any mercy. One of the others is named Stan Reacher, and reveals that Reacher\\'s father (real name William) used his name to enlist in the Marines while underage after killing a local criminal. Stan never knew William\\'s parents, or how closely related they were to his. Stan also is unclear exactly how closely related he and Reacher are to Mark but believes Mark is one of the many grandchildren of a relative Stan never met in person, who made a fortune in real estate. Reacher leaves town with good new stories about his father, but with little additional insight into his exact family tree.\\n\\nCritical reception and analysis\\nCritics have noted the strong theme of \"justice\" pervading the character as well as the book series. Claire E. White, characterises the titular protagonist as: \"wanderer, a hero who is a bit alienated from the establishment, but whose sense of justice is strong. He reminds (me) a bit of a character from the Old West: the strong, mysterious loner who never stays in town for long.\" Mike Ripley detected the influence of Jack Schaefer\\'s western novel Shane in the Reacher novel Echo Burning while Bob Cornwell calls the debut Jack Reacher novel  Killing Floor \"a classic western\". Grantland columnist Bryan Curtis calls the character \"a protective figure, an avenging angel\" and quotes the author Michael Connelly describing the Reacher book series as: \"These are postmodern Westerns, they\\'re Shane. A stranger comes to town and sets things right. Then he leaves town.\" The critic Emily Sargent says of the fictional Reacher: \"just the kind of no-nonsense, ramrod hero an intelligent five-year old would dream up: a strapping, broad-shouldered, idealized father-figure, something akin to God in his wisdom and power, alternately benevolent and overwhelmingly cruel, fair but firm. Good at saving damsels in distress and sorting out bad guys.\"Rick Gekoski, writing for The Guardian, takes a similar if darker interpretation of the character: \"Reacher is, of course, in a long line of American outcast heroes who abjure emotional ties, head out into the wilderness and take upon their own broad shoulders the primitive moral conscience of the tribe. Too immature to make a sexual commitment, obsessed with death and terror, this archetypal hero of American fiction was first described in Leslie Fiedler\\'s classic Love and Death in the American Novel (1960).\" In the same article he also questions whether Fiedler would find that Reacher\\'s hypermasculinity is a sign of the character\\'s \"repressed homosexuality\".Malcolm Gladwell, in an article for The New Yorker, perceives a difference in the Reacher character and the traditional Western characters in terms of the symbolism they represent to the general public. In his opinion \"The traditional Western was a fantasy about lawfulness: it was based on a longing for order among those who had been living without it for too long. The heroes conduct themselves according to strict rules of chivalry. They act— insofar as it is possible —with restraint. In the world we live in today, by contrast, we have too much order: we are, as we have been reminded so frequently lately, over-policed. Our contemporary fantasy is about lawlessness: about what would happen if the institutions of civility melted away and all we were left with was a hard-muscled, rangy guy who could do all the necessary calculations in his head to insure that the bad guy got what he had coming. That\\'s why there are rarely any police in Reacher novels—or judges or courts or lawyers or any discussion or consideration of the law. Nor is there any restraint on the part of the hero. He\\'s not pointing toward a more civilized tomorrow. He\\'s leading us back into the wilderness, with the reassurance that our psychopaths are bigger and stronger than the bad guys\\' psychopaths.\"Sargent also notes the dichotomy in Reacher\\'s character, stating that he is intellectual and generous despite his exterior appearance of being \"unkempt, unshaven and out of uniform, a loner, avenger, perpetual outsider at odds with the army\". In Sargent\\'s express opinion:\\n\\nThe thing about Reacher is that he is not just a thug, even if a well-meaning thug in the manner of, say, Rambo or Bruce Willis. He is also a thinker, an intellectual, capable of quoting Nietzsche or coming up with the etymology of \"vagrant\". And he speaks French....\\n...He therefore brings a certain amount of liberal-leaning finesse and élan to his encounters. He is sympathetic to deserters from the Iraq War and particularly severe on capitalist profiteers. You feel he would probably turn up at an Occupy Wall Street demo. There is something of the hippie in his rootless roaming around America, seeking out injustice and righting wrongs.\\nCurtis concurs, remarking that \"Reacher isn\\'t just a mindless vigilante. He can also be a liberal do-gooder. He has expressed sympathy for gays in the military and undocumented immigrants. In Child\\'s latest book, A Wanted Man, Reacher worries that the Patriot Act will lead to all sorts of \\'national security bullshit.\\' Child has invented a kind of progressive vigilantism. The scumbag is killed, but usually for the right reasons.\"Multiple critics have pointed out that the Jack Reacher character is characterized by his spells of silence, with Curtis claiming \"Reacher\\'s classic line is silence.\"Others have been critical of the various implausibilities and contradictions present in the character and his behavior. Notes The Washington Post journalist Kevin Nance: \"The unlikelihoods and outright impossibilities stack up. Ever a frugal sort, Reacher travels mostly by hitchhiking (as he does at the beginning of \"A Wanted Man\" and 2001\\'s \"Echo Burning,\" both set roughly in the time they were written), even though the practice is roughly as current as bellbottoms and even though his appearance is, as previously established, notably simian. (Not that this deters a series of smart, attractive young women, most of them officers of the law, from jumping into bed with him.) And although he\\'s a loner who seems never so happy — rather like Agent Cooper in \"Twin Peaks\" — as when sitting quietly in a diner with a cup of black coffee and a piece of pie, he has an uncanny knack for stumbling into the worst kinds of trouble, almost none of it connected to himself.\" Michael Cavacini has concurred with this, stating that unlike traditional whodunits, where a detective \"simply solves a problem because it\\'s his job\", Reacher has no formal reason to be involved in anything and consequently \"seems to always wind up in a situation where something goes wrong and he must make right\".\\n\\nAccomplices\\nLee Child has described Reacher\\'s accomplices and their characterization and origin in the following terms: \" The whole cast for each book is new. It kind of depends on what the scenario is and what the set up is. Do I use people that I actually know? In a way yeah, because you met people and you regard them as meta-typical as one thing or another – so as a large extent, yes, they are based on people I\\'ve met but not specific individuals.\"\\n\\nPre-military era\\nJill Hemingway, age 34 according to a police transmission, was a suspended FBI agent operating freelance in New York during 1977. She had been investigating the criminal activities of a New York mobster, Croselli but her investigation had been shut down and she had been suspended, pending review as part of a deal cut by Croselli with the FBI. She had since tried to unsuccessfully bring Croselli down by getting him to boast of his crimes on tape. She admitted that bringing down Croselli had become somewhat of an obsession for her, stating \"[Croselli] burns her up.\" Hemingway is described as a thin, pale, nervous, blonde woman and she teams up with a nearly seventeen year old Reacher in the novella High Heat to incriminate Croselli. She suffered from heart-related ailments and she dies near the end of the story due to a heart attack after having accomplished her goal. Reacher commented, \"She died young, but she had a smile on her face.\"\\n\\nMilitary era\\nElizabeth Deveraux, late 30s, is a former Marine serving as a county sheriff in Carter Crossing, Mississippi in 1997. She appears in The Affair, where she tacitly condones Reacher\\'s highly illegal ways of getting rid of some unsavory characters. She was a potential lover for Reacher, as they had sex several times, but ended up drifting apart.\\nKarla Dixon, age unknown, possibly late 30s is a forensic accountant; formerly a Major in the Army and part of Reacher\\'s \\'Special Investigators Unit\\', which he formed and led in the 90s. They are reunited in Bad Luck & Trouble and secretly rekindle an affair, which they regret not starting back in the Army. She is described as \\'dark, very pretty, comparatively small\\' and slim.  She is extremely good with numbers and shares Reacher\\'s fascination with mathematics.\\nCalvin Franz, One of the 110th special investigators. Calm, resolute, relaxing to be around and good at reassuring people. Franz first appears in The Enemy, working with Reacher in a secondary capacity, and is murdered during the first chapter of Bad Luck and Trouble. He is survived by a wife, and a son who greatly reminds Reacher of his father. He is also mentioned in Never Go Back.\\nGeneral Leon Garber, retired, was Reacher\\'s former commanding officer, mentor and close friend. His only child is Jodie. He risked his life to help Reacher in Die Trying, and willed him his house, as his daughter is wealthy, didn\\'t want it and already owns her own New York City home. He also appears in The Enemy and The Affair, and (through his funeral) in Tripwire.\\nJodie Garber-Jacob, 30, is the daughter of General Leon Garber. She met and fell in love with Reacher when she was 15 and was off-limits to him. In Tripwire, she is divorced, using her married name, working as a corporate attorney and reunites romantically with him after her father\\'s funeral. She and Reacher lived together in New York City and upstate New York in Leon\\'s house which was left in his will to Reacher, his surrogate son. She is mentioned in Echo Burning as having moved to Europe.

She and Reacher had a relationship prior to, and featured in, One Shot.\\nDominique Kohl, 29, was a Sergeant First Class on the way up and assigned to Reacher\\'s unit when he was a captain in the Army. She appears in Persuader, where Reacher remembers the events that led to her death ten years earlier.  Kohl is mentioned again in Personal, when Reacher partners with a woman who reminds him of Kohl.\\nStan Lowrey, late 30s, is a member of Reacher\\'s old 110th MP unit. He is handsome, youthful, and full of energy. A kind of man that gets the job done. Reacher describes him as a regular of pool halls and dark alleys, but with a connection to the earth. He appears in Bad Luck and Trouble and The Affair.\\nDuncan Munro, late 30s, is a member of Reacher\\'s old 110th MP unit. He appears in The Affair. Initially presented as a somewhat upstart outsider with opinions contrary to Reacher, they come to a consensus by the end of the end of the case.\\nFrances Neagley, late 30s, is a partner with a successful private security firm, and former Army Master Sergeant and Military Policeman. She is of medium height, slim, and has dark hair and eyes. She spends large amounts of time in the gym and has a purely platonic relationship with Reacher. However, in Night School (2016), NSA senior Deputy Marian Sinclair notes Neagley\\'s attraction to Reacher, and her refusal to sleep with him.  Reacher points out that Neagley has haptephobia, \"A fear of being touched.\" When Sinclair asks if the condition is as a result of assault, Reacher responds, \"She says she was born with it.\" Her demeanor suggests that she could be considered a female counterpart to Reacher. Rarely impressed, Reacher describes her as sometimes scary. She appears in Without Fail, The Affair and Bad Luck and Trouble,  Night School, and Small Wars and is mentioned in Never Go Back. The first page of Bad Luck and Trouble includes a dedication \"For the real Frances L. Neagley\", who won a Bouchercon charity auction for the naming rights to a character.\\nNash Newman a military pathologist who specializes in identifying battlefield remains and appears in Tripwire.\\nDave O\\'Donnell, late 30s, is a member of Reacher\\'s old 110th MP unit. He appears in Bad Luck and Trouble.

He is meticulous, doesn\\'t mind paperwork, and is usually underestimated because he looks like a white-collar office worker.\\nManuel Orozco, part of the 110th MP Unit, Orozco is fond of puns and enjoys opening and closing a zippo lighter to listen to the sound. After leaving the service, he and Jorge Sanchez became struggling casino security consultants in Las Vegas, with Orozco marrying and fathering several children before his murder in Bad Luck and Trouble. Orozco also appears in Night School and is mentioned in Never Go Back.\\nJorge Sanchez, a member of the 110th MP Unit who first appears in The Enemy, serving at Fort Jackson and helping investigate the murder of an Army Rangers officer. Reacher describes \"durable, eyes narrowed, with a hint of a smile that showed a gold tooth and was as close as he ever came to showing contentment.\" Sanchez is also featured in Bad Luck and Trouble, working in Las Vegas with Manuel Orozco, and is mentioned in Never Go Back.\\nRita Scimeca the victim of a gang rape at Fort Bragg, then-Lieutenant Scimeca hospitalized two of her five attackers.

The film was directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Cruise reprised the role in the sequel, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, an adaptation of the 18th Jack Reacher book Never Go Back, which was directed by Edward Zwick, and released 21 October 2016.Tom Cruise\\'s casting was met with criticism from fans of the book series, primarily because the disparity in their heights, with Reacher portrayed as a blond, 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall, 250-pound man in the novels, while Cruise is a 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall brunette. In 2012 Child commented on Cruise\\'s casting by saying, \"Reacher’s size in the books is a metaphor for an unstoppable force, which Cruise portrays in his own way.\" In 2018, Child expressed the opinion that the fans were right about the height of actor portraying the character.On 14 November 2018, Child announced that he made a deal with Skydance Television and Paramount Television to produce a Jack Reacher series based on Child\\'s novels, during which feature films would no longer be produced. He also stated that Tom Cruise would not be returning to the role, and that another actor would be cast in the role, which he hoped would more properly represent the character than seen in the films. Paramount Television and Skydance Television are said to be produce the potential series. Child said of the recasting:\\n\\n\"I really enjoyed working with Cruise. He\\'s a really, really nice guy. We had a lot of fun. But ultimately the readers are right. The size of Reacher is really, really important and it\\'s a big component of who he is...So what I\\'ve decided to do is – there won\\'t be any more movies with Tom Cruise. Instead we\\'re going to take it to Netflix or something like that. Long-form streaming television, with a completely new actor. We\\'re rebooting and starting over and we\\'re going to try and find the perfect guy.\\nOn 15 July 2019, Variety reported that Amazon will develop the series for Amazon Prime with Nick Santora as the showrunner, writer and executive producer alongside with Child, Don Granger, Christopher McQuarrie, David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Marcy Ross On 4 September 2020, Alan Ritchson was cast as the titular role.\\n\\nIn other authors\\' works\\nReacher is mentioned several times in the Stephen King novel Under the Dome, where he is described by the character Colonel Cox as \"the toughest goddam Army cop that ever served, in my humble opinion.\" Lee Child\\'s endorsement of Under the Dome appears on the cover of at least one edition of the book.\\nReacher is referred to in the Hunt for Reacher series of novels and short stories by Diane Capri, but is never explicitly seen. Capri has said in an interview that the series was inspired by her wondering \"What\\'s [Reacher] doing between books?\"\\nIn the introduction to Good and Valuable Consideration, it is mentioned that while creating his \\'Nick Heller\\' series character, Joseph Finder borrowed many cues from Lee Child\\'s Jack Reacher series.\\nDavid Baldacci\\'s character John Puller is a \"bloody ripoff of Jack Reacher\" according to Lee Child. Child avenged himself by having Jack Reacher break all the fingers of a villain named David Baldacci in \"Never Go Back\".\\nJude Hardin has written about Jack Reacher in the novels The Jack Reacher Files: Fugitive and The Jack Reacher Experiment: Dead Ringer.\\n\\nSee also\\nJack Reacher (book series)\\nJack (hero)\\nMilitary brat\\n\\nReferences\\nExplanatory notes\\n\\nCitations\\n\\nJack Reacher (book series)\\n\\nChild, Lee (1997).

              " 'Jack Reacher (film)': 'Jack Reacher is a 2012 American action thriller film written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, based on Lee Child\\'s 2005 novel One Shot. The film stars Tom Cruise as the title character, with Rosamund Pike, David Oyelowo, Richard Jenkins, Jai Courtney, Werner Herzog, and Robert Duvall also starring. The film entered production in October 2011, and was completed in January 2012. It was filmed entirely on location in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It received mixed reviews but was successful at the box office.\\nThe film was released in North America on December 21, 2012. The musical score was composed by Joe Kraemer, performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony and recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California. Cruise performed all of his own driving stunts during the film\\'s car chase sequence. Cruise reprised his role in the 2016 sequel, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, based on the 2013 novel Never Go Back.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a man drives a van into a parking garage across the Allegheny River from PNC Park, dropping a quarter into the meter. He readies a Springfield Armory M1A and assassinates five people on the river\\'s North Shore Trail from long range before driving off.\\nThe police, headed by Detective Calvin Emerson, find a shell casing as well as the quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint on the coin belongs to James Barr, a former U.S. Army sniper. When the police raid his house, they find the van, equipment for reloading rifle cartridges, the rifle in question, and Barr asleep in his bed.\\nDuring an interrogation by Emerson and District Attorney Alex Rodin, Barr is offered a choice between life in prison in exchange for a full confession or guaranteed death row, as Rodin has never lost a conviction. They are bewildered when Barr instead takes a notepad and writes \"Get Jack Reacher\". Reacher is a drifter and former Army Military Police officer. He arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news report about Barr and the shooting. Emerson and Rodin deny Reacher\\'s request to view the evidence but agree to let him see Barr, who was attacked by fellow inmates and is now in a coma. Reacher meets Barr\\'s defense attorney, Helen Rodin, the District Attorney\\'s daughter, who has been saddled with the apparently hopeless task of saving Barr from the death penalty.\\nHelen can let Reacher see the evidence if he will become her investigator. Reacher retorts that he is not interested in clearing Barr. He reveals that Barr had gone on a killing spree during his tour in Iraq but was not prosecuted because, unbeknownst to Barr, his victims were under investigation for numerous rapes and the U.S. Army wanted them forgotten. Reacher vowed that if Barr tried anything like this again, he would take him down.\\nReacher agrees to investigate if Helen visits the victims\\' families to learn about the people murdered that day. Reacher goes to the crime scene and finds inconsistencies about this location, thinking that a trained shooter would have done the killings from the cover of the van on the nearby Fort Duquesne Bridge. After Helen reports her findings about the victims to Reacher, he suggests that the owner of a local construction company was the intended victim, while the other victims served as a cover-up.\\nAfter an apparently spurious bar fight, Reacher realizes that someone is attempting to strong-arm him into dropping his investigation. Reacher is later framed for the murder of the young woman who was paid to instigate the bar-room brawl, but this only motivates him further. Reacher eventually follows up a lead at a shooting range in the neighboring state of Ohio, owned by former U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Martin Cash, who will talk only if Reacher will demonstrate his U.S. Army sniping skills.\\nThe real perpetrators are a gang masquerading as a legitimate construction firm, led by a former Soviet political prisoner known only as the Zec (prisoner). The gang kidnaps Helen with the aid of Detective Emerson and holds her hostage at a quarry. After he steals Helen\\'s Mercedes-Benz, Reacher outwits the mob guards, killing them (along with Emerson) with Cash\\'s help, before confronting the Zec about the conspiracy. The Zec points out that Reacher has killed most of the witnesses against him and doubts that he would be convicted, while also admitting that any prison sentence he is likely to serve would be relatively easy compared to his time in Siberia. Reacher shoots the Zec in the head on the spot.\\nReacher and Cash flee the scene with confidence that Helen will clear Reacher\\'s name. When Barr awakens from his coma, he tells Helen that he has no recent memory but believes that he must be guilty of the shootings. Barr\\'s mental reconstruction of how he would have committed the shootings confirms that Reacher\\'s theory was correct from the beginning. Still unaware of all these developments, Barr is willing to accept both responsibility and his punishment, fearing that Reacher will mete out justice if the law does not. However, it is clear he will be cleared of charges in this killing spree. Meanwhile, Reacher, sitting in a bus, turns around to a man verbally and physically abusing a woman sitting beside him.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nAttempts to adapt author Lee Child\\'s Jack Reacher novel series into a film have been made ever since the character debuted in 1997\\'s Killing Floor. After being optioned with no success to PolyGram and later New Line Cinema, Paramount Pictures and Cruise/Wagner Productions acquired the film rights in 2005. Screenwriter Josh Olson was then hired to adapt Child\\'s then-most recent novel in the Reacher series, One Shot (2005). In July 2010, Christopher McQuarrie, who previously collaborated with Cruise/Wagner Productions on the 2008 film Valkyrie, signed on to rework Olson\\'s script and ultimately direct the film.\\n\\nCasting\\nIn June 2011, Tom Cruise was in talks for playing the role of Jack Reacher. The following month, Cruise closed a deal with the studios and signed on for the part. Some fans of the novel series became vocal over the casting of Cruise due to the actor\\'s height not matching the description of Reacher in the novels. Explaining the casting decision, author Lee Child said that it would be impossible to find a suitable actor to play the giant Reacher and to recreate the feel of the book onscreen, and that Cruise had the talent to make an effective Reacher. Child also said, \"Reacher\\'s size in the books is a metaphor for an unstoppable force, which Cruise portrays in his own way.\" Of Cruise\\'s relatively small stature, Child said, \"With another actor you might get 100% of the height but only 90% of Reacher. With Tom, you\\'ll get 100% of Reacher with 90% of the height.\"Following the casting of Cruise, Rosamund Pike was cast as the female lead. Other actresses who were in the running for the role included Hayley Atwell and Alexa Davalos. By September 2011, the main cast was locked in with the hiring of David Oyelowo, Richard Jenkins, Jai Courtney, and Robert Duvall. Werner Herzog, primarily known for his directorial work, rounded out the cast in October 2011 when he signed on to play the film\\'s chief villain.In April 2017, Dwayne Johnson revealed that he was in the running to play Jack Reacher before Cruise was hired.In a 2018 interview, two years after the 2016 release of the sequel, Child agreed that the readers were correct in their criticism, stating:\\n\\nI really enjoyed working with Cruise. He\\'s a really, really nice guy. We had a lot of fun. But ultimately the readers are right. The size of Reacher is really, really important and it\\'s a big component of who he is...So what I\\'ve decided to do is – there won\\'t be any more movies with Tom Cruise. Instead we\\'re going to take it to Netflix or something like that. Long-form streaming television, with a completely new actor. We\\'re rebooting and starting over and we\\'re going to try and find the perfect guy.\\n\\nFilming\\nProduction on the film began in October 2011 and was completed in January 2012. Cruise performed all of his own driving stunts during the film\\'s signature car chase sequence. \"Action to me is something very fun to shoot. The challenge in most car chases is you\\'re trying to hide the fact that it\\'s not the actor driving,\" McQuarrie said. \"The challenge here was the exact opposite. We were trying to find a way to show that it was always Tom driving. He\\'s literally driving in every stunt sequence.\"In February 2012, Kevin Messick, one of the film\\'s executive producers, sued Don Granger and Gary Levinsohn, two other producers, for breach of contract over a joint venture agreement, claiming he had \"helped to develop the film, renew Paramount\\'s options for the rights to the book, and participated in the search for a screenwriter\" but starting in July 2010, had been left out of meetings with the screenwriter and the studio and not given certain drafts of the screenplay while it was under development. Messick is suing for \"unspecified damages, his producer\\'s fees and the right to participate in any upcoming sequels.\"\\n\\nMusic\\nThe film\\'s musical score was composed by Joe Kraemer, who previously scored director McQuarrie\\'s The Way of the Gun (2000). Kraemer was announced as the composer for the film in July 2012, having already started work on it. After spending eight weeks working with McQuarrie on materials to present to producers, Kraemer\\'s hiring was approved and he directly began working on the film\\'s opening eight minutes. \"I have a number of tricks that I use to spark the creative process,\" said Kraemer on his scoring process after having seen the film. \"Sometimes I\\'ll use my mathematical understanding of music to devise a theme (such as the open fifths of Reacher\\'s theme), sometimes I\\'ll have an orchestral color in mind (i.e. the music for THE ZEC). The actual composing process probably resembles Max Steiner more than anyone else I know of. I start at the first frame of the movie and work my through to the end, chronologically, in order.\"The film is noted for its balance between music and silence, with music primarily absent or reserved during a majority of the film\\'s action sequences. Discussing his approach to this balance, Kraemer described, \"Music can make such an impact when it enters a scene, and obviously the only way to do that is to have silence beforehand. I also generally like to have long tails on my cues so that they sort of fade away rather than ending abruptly. In this way, I try to weave music in and out very carefully so that the audience is as unaware as possible of the entrances and exits. I often cite Patton as a prime example of great spotting – a three and half hour biopic with, what, twenty-eight minutes of score? That\\'s unheard of today. But it worked!\"The score was performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony and recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California. A soundtrack album for the film was released on December 18, 2012 by La-La Land Records.\\nTrack listing\\n\\nDistribution\\nMarketing\\nThe trailer for Jack Reacher was officially released on Cruise\\'s birthday, July 3, 2012.\\n\\nTheatrical release\\nJack Reacher, then titled One Shot, was originally slated to be released in February 2013.

The opening scene shows a sniper shooting at people including a woman holding a small child, and one point aiming the cross-hairs directly at her. Writer-director McQuarrie endorsed the decision, saying he and Cruise insisted upon it:\\nNobody should be celebrating anything 24 hours after a tragic event like that. We thought long and hard about it. This was not a snap judgment, because we wanted to give back to the city of Pittsburgh [by having the premiere there], because they were so great to us.The film held its United Kingdom premiere on December 10, 2012 at London\\'s Odeon Leicester Square.

And he nails it. The patented smile is gone, replaced by a glower that makes Jack Reacher a dark and dazzling ride into a new kind of hell.\"Many of the negative reviews still referred to the film as entertaining, including The Guardian, which called it \"outrageous but entertaining\". \\nPeter Debruge of Variety was critical of the casting of Cruise as Reacher: \"Reacher is a brawny action figure whose exploits would have been a good fit for the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone back in the day, but feel less fun when delegated to a leading man like Tom Cruise. The star is too charismatic to play someone so cold-blooded, and his fans likely won\\'t appreciate the stretch. \"\\nLisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"That Cruise fails to make a case for Reacher\\'s allure, though, has less to do with physical dissonance than it does with the film\\'s inability - stupefying inability, really - to otherwise make a case for the character\\'s originality in a movie so choked with visual clichés and dreadfully moldy dialogue.\"\\n\\nSequel\\nWhile Jack Reacher was intended to be a tent-pole for a film series, it was initially reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to its lackluster run at the North American box office. However, in February 2013, the possibility of a sequel became more likely after the film surpassed a gross of $200 million worldwide.

After experiencing a life-altering epiphany about his role as a sports agent, he writes a mission statement about perceived dishonesty in the sports management business and his desire to work with fewer clients to produce a better personal relationship with them. In turn, SMI management decides to send Bob Sugar (Jay Mohr), Jerry\\'s protégé, to fire him. Consequently, Jerry and Sugar each call all of Jerry\\'s clients to try and convince them not to hire the services of the other. Jerry speaks to Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.), one of his clients who is disgruntled with his contract. He needs a $10 million contract for his family to live on. Jerry informs him if he gets injured for the season, he will get no money from the Cardinals. Rod tests Jerry\\'s resolve through a very long telephone conversation, while Sugar is able to persuade the rest of Jerry\\'s clients to stick with SMI instead.\\nLeaving the office, Jerry announces that he will start his own agency and asks if anyone is willing to join him, to which only 26-year-old single mother Dorothy Boyd (Renée Zellweger) agrees. Meanwhile, Frank \"Cush\" Cushman (Jerry O\\'Connell), a superstar quarterback prospect who expects to be the number one pick in the NFL Draft, initially also stays with Jerry after he makes a visit to the Cushman home. However, Sugar is able to persuade Cushman and his father to sign with SMI over Jerry the night before the draft. Cushman\\'s father implies they decided to sign with Sugar over Jerry due to Tidwell\\'s race, stating they signed while Jerry was \"in the lobby with the black fella\".\\nAfter an argument, Jerry breaks up with his disgruntled fiancée Avery (Kelly Preston). He then turns to Dorothy, becoming closer to her young son, Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki), and eventually starts a relationship with her. Dorothy contemplates moving to San Diego as she has a secure job offer there; however, she and Jerry agree to get married. Jerry concentrates all his efforts on Rod, now his only client, who turns out to be very difficult to satisfy (\"Show me the money\"). Over the next several months, the two direct harsh criticism towards each other with Rod claiming that Jerry is not trying hard enough to get him a contract while Jerry claims that Rod is not proving himself worthy of the money for which he asks; one point of contention is that Rod is not very likable and comes across as aloof to the fans. Rod takes Jerry\\'s advice to prove he is worthy of his contract. Rod is playing well and his team is winning. Meanwhile, Jerry\\'s marriage with Dorothy gradually deteriorates and they eventually separate.\\nDuring a Monday Night Football game between the Cardinals and the Dallas Cowboys, Rod plays well but appears to receive a serious injury when catching a winning touchdown, securing a spot for the Cardinals in the playoffs. He recovers, however, and dances for the wildly cheering crowd. Afterwards, Jerry and Rod embrace in front of other athletes and sports agents and show how their relationship has progressed from a strictly business one to a close personal one, which was one of the points Jerry made in his mission statement. He then flies back home to meet Dorothy, telling her that he loves her and wants her in his life, which she accepts, uttering \"You had me at hello.\" Rod later appears on Roy Firestone\\'s sports show. Unbeknownst to him, Jerry has secured him an $11.2 million contract with the Cardinals allowing him to finish his pro football career in Arizona.

Diane Lane was considered for the role of Avery Bishop, however the role was eventually given to Kelly Preston. Billy Wilder was considered for the part of Jerry\\'s mentor Dicky Fox.\\n\\nProduct placement\\nTriStar received merchandise and marketing services of over $1.5 million from Reebok in exchange for incorporating a commercial into the film and depicting the Reebok brand within certain agreed-upon standards; when the film was theatrically released, the commercial had been left out and a tirade including \"broadsides against Reebok\" was included.

The film itself was nominated for Best Picture, and crew members on the film were nominated for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing awards.\\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, writing that there \"are so many subplots that Jerry Maguire seems too full\" and also commented that the film \"starts out looking cynical and quickly becomes a heartwarmer.\" Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote \"An exceptionally tasty contempo comedic romance, Jerry Maguire runs an unusual pattern on its way to scoring an unexpected number of emotional, social and entertaining points. Smartly written and boasting a sensational cast, Cameron Crowe\\'s shrewdly observed third feature also gives Tom Cruise one of his very best roles...\"Former Green Bay Packers vice president Andrew Brandt stated that the film \"accurately portrayed the cutthroat nature of the agent business, especially the lengths to which agents will go to retain or pilfer clients. It also captured the financial, emotional and psychological investment that goes far beyond negotiating contracts.\"\\n\\nAccolades\\nThe film\\'s screenplay was later voted the 66th greatest ever written in a poll by the Writers Guild of America.\\n\\nHome media\\nJerry Maguire was first released on VHS and Laserdisc on May 29, 1997. It is the best-selling non-Disney VHS tape of all time, with over 3 million copies sold on the first day and another 1 million on the second day and sold 1 million copies each day, including Blockbuster Video, Hollywood Video, Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy and many other rental stores/retail chains. The previews shown before the movie were My Best Friend\\'s Wedding, Men in Black and Starship Troopers. It was re-released on VHS around late 1999, without any of the aforementioned previews.\\nThe film was first released onto DVD on June 24, 1997 and around 2002 respectively in both a standard edition and a two-disc \"Special Edition\". While the standard edition contains no special features, the two-disc edition primarily includes deleted scenes, commentary tracks, featurettes, and a music video for Bruce Springsteen\\'s \"Secret Garden.\" The film was later released onto Blu-ray on September 9, 2008, with the same special features found on the second disc of the DVD \"Special Edition.\" in 2008, The film was triple packed with A Few Good Men and Born on the Fourth of July by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment/Universal Pictures Home Entertainment in United Kingdom only.

[1]\\n\\nLegacy\\nJerry Maguire spawned several popular quotations, including \"Show me the money!\" (shouted repeatedly in a phone exchange between Rod Tidwell and Jerry Maguire), \"You complete me,\" \"Help me help you,\" \"The key to this business is personal relationships\" and \"You had me at \\'hello\\'\" (said by Renée Zellweger\\'s Dorothy Boyd after a lengthy romantic plea by Jerry Maguire), and \"Kwan,\" a word used by Cuba Gooding Jr.\\'s Tidwell meaning love, respect, community, and money (also spelled \"quan\" and \"quawn\") to illustrate the difference between himself and other football players: \"Other football players may have the coin, but they won\\'t have the \\'Kwan\\'.\" These lines are largely attributed to Cameron Crowe, director and screenwriter of the film. Zellweger said of filming the famous \"hello\" line, \"Cameron had me say it a few different ways. It\\'s so funny, because when I read it, I didn\\'t get it — I thought it was a typo somehow. I kept looking at it. It was the one thing in the script that I was looking at going, \\'Is that right? Can that be right? How is that right?\\' I thought, \\'Is there a better way to say that? Am I not getting it? I just don\\'t know how to do it.\\'\" Brandt stated in 2014 that \"I definitely noticed an uptick of young people becoming interested in the agent business after Jerry Maguire\". \"Some of what happened to the agent industry would have happened without \\'Jerry,\\' but definitely not as fast as it did,\" noted Peter Schaffer, who has been a sports agent since 1988.In June 2008, AFI revealed its \"Ten Top Ten\"—the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. Jerry Maguire was acknowledged as the tenth best film in the sports genre. It was also voted by AFI as #100 on its list of 100 Passions. The quotes \"Show me the money!\" and \"You had me at \\'hello\\'\" were also ranked by AFI on its list of 100 Movie Quotes, ranked #25 and #52 respectively.American Film Institute Lists\\n\\nAFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Movies – Nominated\\nAFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Laughs – Nominated\\nAFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Passions – #100\\nAFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Songs:\\nSecret Garden – Nominated\\nAFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:\\n\"Show me the money!\" – #25\\n\"You had me at \"hello.\"\" – #52\\n\"You complete me.\" – Nominated\\nAFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Cheers – Nominated\\nAFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – Nominated\\nAFI\\'s 10 Top 10 – #10 Sports Film (also nominated Romantic Comedy)In June 2010, Entertainment Weekly named Jerry Maguire one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.In 2017, the NFL, to commemorate the film\\'s 20th anniversary edition, produced two \"A Football Life\" mockumentaries, detailing the careers of Rod Tidwell and Frank Cushman after the events of the film.  Beau Bridges, Jay Mohr, Jerry O\\'Connell, and Aries Spears reprised their roles from the film, along with Roy Firestone and several real-life sports figures, including Shaquille O\\'Neal.  According to the fictional history, Cushman retired after only four years due to a severe case of athlete\\'s foot, and devoted himself to charity work with children with the same affliction; Tidwell was offered an even more lucrative contract, but declined, declaring that the \"quan\" was not there, and he preferred to devote more time to his family.

              " 'John Grisham': 'John Ray Grisham Jr. (; born February 8, 1955) is an American novelist, attorney, politician, and activist, best known for his popular legal thrillers. His books have been translated into 42 languages and published worldwide.\\nGrisham graduated from Mississippi State University and received a J.D. degree from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1981. He practiced criminal law for about a decade and served in the Mississippi House of Representatives from January 1984 to September 1990.His first novel, A Time to Kill, was published in June 1989, four years after he began writing it. According to Academy of Achievement his books have sold 300 million copies and he has written 28 consecutive number one bestsellers. A Galaxy British Book Awards winner, Grisham is one of only three authors to sell two million copies on a first printing, the other two being Tom Clancy and J. K. Rowling.Grisham\\'s first bestseller, The Firm, sold more than seven million copies. The book was adapted into a 1993 feature film of the same name, starring Tom Cruise, and a 2012 TV series which continues the story ten years after the events of the film and novel. Eight of his other novels have also been adapted into films: The Chamber, The Client, A Painted House, The Pelican Brief, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, Skipping Christmas, and A Time to Kill. Grisham\\'s latest book (his 42nd published novel), A Time for Mercy, is his third story involving the characters established in A Time to Kill and further follows the story of Jake Brigance, a Mississippi small town lawyer representing a minor accused of murder.\\n\\nEarly life\\nGrisham, the second of five siblings, was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to Wanda (née Skidmore) and John Ray Grisham. His father was a construction worker and a cotton farmer, and his mother was a homemaker. When Grisham was four years old, his family settled in Southaven, Mississippi.As a child, he wanted to be a baseball player. In A Painted House, a novel with strong autobiographical elements, the protagonist - a seven-year old farmer boy - manifests a strong wish to become a baseball player. As noted in the foreword to Calico Joe, Grisham gave up playing baseball at the age of 18, after a game in which a hostile pitcher aimed a beanball at him, and narrowly missed doing the young Grisham grave harm.\\nGrisham has been a Christian since he was eight years old, and has described his conversion to Christianity as \"the most important event\" in his life. After leaving law school, he participated in some missionary work in Brazil, under the First Baptist Church of Oxford.Although Grisham\\'s parents lacked formal education, his mother encouraged him to read and prepare for college. He drew on his childhood experiences for his novel A Painted House. Grisham started working for a plant nursery as a teenager, watering bushes for $1.00 an hour. He was soon promoted to a fence crew for $1.50 an hour. He wrote about the job: \"there was no future in it\". At 16, Grisham took a job with a plumbing contractor but says he \"never drew inspiration from that miserable work\".Through one of his father\\'s contacts, he managed to find work on a highway asphalt crew in Mississippi at age 17. It was during this time that an unfortunate incident got him \"serious\" about college. A fight with gunfire broke out among the crew causing Grisham to run to a nearby restroom to find safety. He did not come out until after the police had detained the perpetrators. He hitchhiked home and started thinking about college. His next work was in retail, as a salesclerk in a department store men\\'s underwear section, which he described as \"humiliating\". By this time, Grisham was halfway through college. Planning to become a tax lawyer, he was soon overcome by \"the complexity and lunacy\" of it. He decided to return to his hometown as a trial lawyer.He attended the Northwest Mississippi Community College in Senatobia, Mississippi and later attended Delta State University in Cleveland. Grisham changed colleges three times before completing a degree. He eventually graduated from Mississippi State University in 1977, receiving a B.S. degree in accounting. He later enrolled in the University of Mississippi School of Law to become a tax lawyer, but his interest shifted to general civil litigation. He graduated in 1981 with a J.D. degree.\\n\\nCareer\\nLaw and politics\\nGrisham practiced law for about a decade and won election as a Democrat to the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1984 to 1990, at an annual salary of $8,000.Grisham represented the seventh district, which included DeSoto County. By his second term in the Mississippi state legislature, he was the vice-chairman of the Apportionment and Elections Committee and a member of several other committees.Grisham\\'s writing career blossomed with the success of his second book, The Firm, and he gave up practicing law, except for returning briefly in 1996 to fight for the family of a railroad worker who was killed on the job. His official website states: \"He was honoring a commitment made before he had retired from the law to become a full-time writer. Grisham successfully argued his clients\\' case, earning them a jury award of $683,500 — the biggest verdict of his career.\"\\n\\nWriting career\\nGrisham said the big case came in 1984, but it was not his case. As he was hanging around the court, he overheard a 12-year-old girl telling the jury what had happened to her. Her story intrigued Grisham, and he began watching the trial. He saw how the members of the jury cried as she told them about having been raped and beaten. It was then, Grisham later wrote in The New York Times, that a story was born.Musing over \"what would have happened if the girl\\'s father had murdered her assailants\", took three years to complete his first book, A Time to Kill. Finding a publisher was not easy. The book was rejected by 28 publishers before Wynwood Press, an unknown publisher, agreed to give it a modest 5,000-copy printing. It was published in June 1989.The day after Grisham completed A Time to Kill, he began work on his second novel, The Firm.\\n The Firm remained on The New York Times\\' bestseller list for 47 weeks, and became the seventh bestselling novel of 1991. This would begin a streak of having one of the top 10 selling novels of the year for nearly the next two decades. In 1992 and 1993 he had the second bestselling book of the year with The Pelican Brief and The Client and from 1994 to 2000 he had the number one bestselling book every year. In 2001 Grisham did not have the bestselling book of the year but he did have both the second as well as third book on the list with Skipping Christmas and A Painted House.\\nIn 1992, The Firm was made into a film starring Tom Cruise and was released in June 1993, grossing $270 million. A filmed version of The Pelican Brief starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington was released later that year and grossed $195 million. Following their success, Regency Enterprises paid Grisham $2.25 million for the rights to The Client which was released in 1994 starring Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones and then Universal Pictures paid him the highest amount ever for an unpublished novel, paying $3.75 million for the rights to The Chamber. In August 1994, New Regency paid a record $6 million for the rights to A Time to Kill, with Grisham asking for a guarantee that Joel Schumacher, the director of The Client, would direct.Beginning with A Painted House, Grisham broadened his focus from law to the more general rural South but continued to write legal thrillers at the rate of one a year. In 2002 he once again claimed the number one book of the year with The Summons. In 2003 and 2004 he missed the number one bestseller of the year due to The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown but he once again produced two novels which ended the year in the top 5. In 2004, The Last Juror ended the year at number four and in 2005 he overtook The Da Vinci Code and returned to number one for the year with The Broker. In 2006 it marked the first time since 1990 that he did not have one of the top selling books of the year, but he returned to number two in 2007, number one in 2008 and number two in 2009.\\nHe has also written sports fiction and comedy fiction. He wrote the original screenplay for and produced the 2004 baseball movie Mickey, which starred Harry Connick Jr.In 2005, Grisham received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award, which is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust.In 2010, Grisham started writing a series of legal thrillers for children aged 9 to 12 years. It features Theodore Boone, a 13-year-old who gives his classmates legal advice ranging from rescuing impounded dogs to helping their parents prevent their house from being repossessed. He said, \"I\\'m hoping primarily to entertain and interest kids, but at the same time I\\'m quietly hoping that the books will inform them, in a subtle way, about law.\"He also stated that it was his daughter, Shea, who inspired him to write the Theodore Boone series. \"My daughter Shea is a teacher in North Carolina and when she got her fifth grade students to read the book, three or four of them came up afterwards and said they\\'d like to go into the legal profession.\"In an October 2006 interview on the Charlie Rose show, Grisham stated that he usually takes only six months to write a book, and his favorite author is John le Carré.In 2011 and 2012 his novels The Litigators and The Racketeer claimed the top spot in The New York Times best seller list.[2] [3] The novels were one of the best selling books of those years spending several weeks atop various best seller lists.[4][5][6] In 2013 he again reached the top five in the US best-seller list.\\n[7] In November 2015 his novel Rogue Lawyer was at the top of the New York Times Fiction Best Seller for two weeks.[8]\\nIn 2017, Grisham released two legal thrillers. Camino Island was published on June 6, 2017. The book appeared at the top of several best seller lists including USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times. The Rooster Bar, published on October 24, 2017, was called his most original work yet, in The News Herald.\\n\\nSouthern settings\\nSeveral of Grisham\\'s legal thrillers are set in the fictional town of Clanton, Mississippi, in the equally fictional Ford County, a northwest Mississippi town still deeply divided by racism. The first novel set in Clanton was A Time to Kill.\\nOther stories set there include The Last Juror, The Summons, The Chamber, The Reckoning, A Time for Mercy and Sycamore Row. The stories in the collection Ford County are also set in and around Clanton. Other Grisham novels have non-fictional Southern settings, for example The Partner and The Runaway Jury are set in Biloxi, and large portions of The Pelican Brief in New Orleans.\\nA Painted House is set in and around the town of Black Oak, Arkansas, where Grisham spent some of his childhood.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nMarriage\\nGrisham married Renee Jones on May 8, 1981. The couple have two children together: Shea and Ty. Ty played college baseball for the University of Virginia.\\n\\nReal estate holdings\\nThe family splits their time among their Victorian home on a farm outside Oxford, Mississippi, a home in Charlottesville, VA, a home in Destin, Florida and a condominium at McCorkle Place in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, purchased in 2008.\\n\\nReligion\\nAs a former-Baptist, he advocates the separation of church and state. He once said, \"I have some very deep religious convictions that I keep to myself, and when I see people using them for political gain it really irritates me.\"\\nLater in life, Grisham converted to The Presbyterian Church. He cited a preference for a more highly educated clergy and a desire for a “more dignified” style of worship.\\n\\nBaseball\\nGrisham has a lifelong passion for baseball demonstrated partly by his support of Little League activities in both Oxford and in Charlottesville. In 1996, Grisham built a $3.8 million youth baseball complex.As he notes in the foreword to Calico Joe, Grisham himself stopped playing baseball after a ball thrown by a pitcher nearly caused him a serious injury. This experience left Grisham with an abiding dislike of pitchers.\\nHe remains a fan of Mississippi State University (MSU)\\'s baseball team and wrote about his ties to the university and the Left Field Lounge in the introduction for the book Dudy Noble Field: A Celebration of MSU Baseball.Since moving to the Charlottesville area, Grisham has become a supporter of Virginia Cavaliers athletics and is regularly seen sitting courtside at basketball games. Grisham also contributed to a $1.2 million donation to the Cavalier baseball team in Charlottesville, Virginia, which was used in the 2002 renovation of Davenport Field.\\n\\nPolitical activism\\nGrisham is a member of the board of directors of the Innocence Project, which campaigns to free and exonerate unjustly convicted people on the basis of DNA evidence. The Innocence Project contends that wrongful convictions are not isolated or rare events but instead arise from systemic defects. Grisham has testified before Congress on behalf of the Innocence Project.Grisham has appeared on Dateline NBC, Bill Moyers Journal on PBS, and other programs. He wrote for The New York Times in 2013 about an unjustly held prisoner at Guantanamo.Grisham opposes capital punishment, a position very strongly manifested in the plot of The Confession. He believes that prison rates in the United States are excessive, and the justice system is \"locking up far too many people\". Citing examples including \"black teenagers on minor drugs charges\" to \"those who had viewed child porn online\", he controversially added that he believed not all viewers of child pornography are necessarily pedophiles. After hearing from numerous people against this position, he later recanted this statement in a Facebook post. He went on to clarify that he was defending a former friend from law school who was caught in a sting thinking he was looking at adult porn but it was in reality sixteen and seventeen year old minors and went on to add, \"I have no sympathy for real pedophiles. God, please lock those people up.\" \"Anyone who harms a child for profit or pleasure.... Should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\"The Mississippi State University Libraries, Manuscript Division, maintains the John Grisham Room, an archive containing materials generated during the author\\'s tenure as Mississippi State Representative and relating to his writings. In 2012, the Law Library at the University of Mississippi School of Law was renamed in his honor. It had been named for more than a decade after the late Senator James Eastland.\\nIn 2015, Grisham, along with about 60 others, signed a letter published in the Clarion-Ledger urging that an inset within the flag of Mississippi containing a Confederate flag be removed. He co-authored the letter with author Greg Iles; the pair contacted various public figures from Mississippi for support.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\n1993 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement\\n2005 Peggy V.

              " 'Knight and Day': 'Knight and Day is a 2010 American action comedy film directed by James Mangold and starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. The film was the second on-screen collaboration of Cruise and Diaz, following the 2001 film Vanilla Sky. Diaz plays June Havens, a classic car restorer who unwittingly gets caught up with the eccentric secret agent Roy Miller, played by Cruise, who is on the run from the CIA.\\nThe film\\'s investors offset funding costs by paying Cruise a lower advance fee and providing him a share of revenue only after the financiers were repaid their investment in the production. Filming took place in several locations, mainly in several cities located in Massachusetts, while other scenes were filmed in Spain and parts of Austria.\\nKnight and Day was released in the United States on June 24, 2010. The film received mixed reviews from film critics, with praise for the performances of Cruise and Diaz but criticism was aimed at its script. It grossed over $261 million worldwide, recouping its $117 million budget.\\nThe film was remade in Bollywood as Bang Bang!, released October 2, 2014, with Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif in the lead roles.\\n\\nPlot\\nReturning home to Boston from buying car parts in Wichita, June Havens (Cameron Diaz) collides with Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) at the airport, twice, and is bumped to a later flight. CIA Agent John Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard), believing June is working with Roy, puts her back on the plane. While June is in the plane’s restroom, Roy subdues the passengers and flight crew, all agents sent by Fitzgerald, and crash-lands the plane in a cornfield. He drugs the shocked June, warning that agents will come after her.\\nWaking at home, June prepares for her sister April’s (Maggie Grace) wedding, and learns she wants to sell their father\\'s 1966 Pontiac GTO tri-power, which June had planned to restore as a wedding gift. June is picked up by Fitzgerald and his agents. Roy appears, killing numerous agents in a highway chase and rescuing June. She flees to her ex-boyfriend Rodney (Marc Blucas), a firefighter, before Roy arrives and pretends to take June hostage.\\nRoy persuades June that she is safer with him, and reveals that he is in possession of the Zephyr, a perpetual energy battery; he had been assigned to guard its inventor, Simon Feck, until Fitzgerald tried to steal the battery, framing Roy. In Brooklyn, June and Roy discover Feck has gone into hiding but left Roy a clue that he is in the Alps. They are attacked by henchmen sent by Spanish arms dealer Antonio Quintana (Jordi Mollà). Drugged again, June drifts in and out of consciousness as they are captured and then escape to Roy’s off-the-grid island. Accepting a call from her sister, June accidentally leads Quintana\\'s men to the hideaway. Escaping Quintana’s unmanned aerial assault vehicle in a helicopter, Roy knocks June out to circumvent her fear of flying.\\nJune wakes up aboard a train in Austria, where Roy has reunited with Simon, and they manage to kill Bernard (Falk Hentschel), an assassin hired by Quintana. After checking into a hotel in Salzburg, June follows Roy to a meeting with Naomi (Gal Gadot), Quintana\\'s henchwoman, where he offers to sell the Zephyr.\\nFitzgerald and C.I.A. Director Isabel George (Viola Davis) find June and reveal that Roy used her at the airport to smuggle the Zephyr past security. Heartbroken, June leads the C.I.A. to the hotel. Fleeing across the rooftops, Roy is shot and falls into the river with the Zephyr. Simon is kidnapped from C.I.A. custody by Fitzgerald, the real traitor, to be delivered to Quintana in Spain.\\nReturning home, June attends her sister’s wedding, and visits an address Roy had been monitoring, where she meets his parents and learns his real name is Matthew Knight. They believe their son, an Army sergeant and Eagle Scout, was killed in action, and have won various lotteries and sweepstakes they do not remember entering. Leaving a message on her own answering machine declaring that she has the Zephyr, June is taken by Quintana\\'s men to Sevilla. Drugged with a prototype truth serum, June explains that Roy\\'s deal with Quintana was meant to alert the C.I.A. so June would be returned home safely in time for the wedding. Roy, tracking Fitzgerald, rescues June, and leads Quintana and his men on a car chase. Quintana is killed by a bull stampede, and Roy trades Fitzgerald the Zephyr for Simon. Fitzgerald shoots Simon anyway, but Roy takes the bullet instead. Simon reveals that the battery is unstable, and it explodes, killing Fitzgerald.\\nRoy is hospitalized in Washington, D.C., where George tells him June has moved on, and welcomes him back to the C.I.A.; however, George’s coded language – as Roy explained to June earlier – reveals that he will be killed. June, disguised as a nurse, drugs Roy and breaks him out of the hospital. Waking up in June’s rebuilt GTO, Roy and June drive toward Cape Horn, and Roy\\'s parents unexpectedly receive their own tickets to Cape Horn.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nBefore film director James Mangold signed on to Knight and Day, it was previously associated with director Tom Dey. More than 12 writers contributed to the film. The Writers Guild of America, West, decided that due to this large number of contributors, only Patrick O\\'Neill, who had worked on the beginning layout of the script, would get credit. Other writers that worked on the film\\'s script included Scott Frank, Laeta Kalogridis, Ted Griffin, Dana Fox, and Simon Kinberg.\\n\\nCasting\\nThe film changed lead cast members multiple times while the production was mired in \"development hell\". Prior to finalizing on actors Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, when the film was titled Wichita, comedian and actor Adam Sandler was offered a starring role in the film; he declined, saying, \"I just don\\'t see me with a gun.\" Wichita was developed under production at Revolution Studios; the film was later moved to Sony Pictures. At Sony Pictures, actors Chris Tucker and Eva Mendes were slated to portray the two lead roles in the film; it was titled Trouble Man and intended as a romantic vehicle film for the two actors.After Tucker and Mendes dropped out of the lead roles, Diaz signed on to the film with Sony Pictures, and actor Gerard Butler met with production staff regarding starring opposite Diaz. Butler instead decided to take on the lead role in the film The Bounty Hunter, opposite actress Jennifer Aniston. Tom Cruise, who at the time was auditioning for parts in five films, including Salt, and The Tourist, decided he wanted to star in Knight and Day, and he wanted to modify the role of the male lead character with his own ideas.\\n\\nFinancing\\nThe film\\'s production partners, New Regency and Dune Entertainment, offset financing for the film by paying Tom Cruise a lower advance fee than he normally received. Cruise previously normally received $20 million or higher in an advance fee, but he only received $11 million for Knight and Day. Cruise also agreed not to receive first-dollar gross, which was customary for him. That meant that Cruise would not receive a share of the film\\'s revenue until Knight and Day funding investors had first gained back their investment in the production. In total, production costs for the film exceeded $125 million.\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography began in mid-September 2009 in Boston and Bridgewater, Massachusetts. Airport terminal scenes were filmed at Worcester Regional Airport. Filming also took place in Melrose, Danvers, and New Bedford, Massachusetts. Filming was also done in Spanish cities Seville and Cadiz, and the Austrian city of Salzburg.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe Black Eyed Peas recorded a theme song for the film, titled \"Someday\".\\n\\nMarketing\\nKnight and Day had been set for a June 25, 2010, release date, but FOX moved its debut up two days to June 23; in the face of poor initial tracking numbers. The New York Observer analyzed the marketing for the film, which included an attempt at pushing a \"viral video\" of the two main stars; journalist Christopher Rosen commented on the desperation level of the publicity campaign, \"the marketing for this thing has seemed more intrusive and desperate than any other big-ticket release in some time.\" Film producer Don Carmody commented negatively regarding the film\\'s trailer, calling it \"dull\", and said the film would not do well because of the age of its two stars, \"Cameron Diaz I think was a star, but she’s no longer a star. Some of those stars are getting a little up there (in age).\" The Hollywood Reporter noted that \"potential viewers remain startlingly indifferent to whether they actually end up seeing it. And attention thus far is still drawn mostly by those under 25, which indicates that the fans who grew up with star Tom Cruise have moved on.\"FOX attempted to increase word of mouth advertising for the film by showing a sneak preview on June 19, 2010; the Los Angeles Times reported the same day that pre-release surveys determined that the film was likely to become a commercial flop. Projections indicated that the film would only make $20 million at the box office; much less than the film production cost of $125 million. FOX production President Emma Watts said of the film\\'s commercial prospects, \"We aren\\'t exactly where we hoped we would be.\" The Los Angeles Times noted that \"... Cruise and Diaz are not as popular with younger moviegoers, who often drive big opening weekends in the summer. ... Among teenage and college-age males, the movie is barely registering, according to people who have seen the survey results.\" New York Magazine reported the film was \"tracking miserably\" prior to its first week. New York Magazine reported that \"one of the film\\'s biggest handicaps: its star, Tom Cruise\". A FOX official commented to New York Magazine regarding the film\\'s pre-release polling data, \"at those numbers, we can’t open the movie right now. Hopefully, they’ll change in the next few days.\"Upon hearing that tracking data on June 22, 2010, showed the film was not likely to produce revenue over $30 million in its first five days on screen, a FOX executive told TheWrap he was \"confounded\", and commented, \"Tracking says one thing, but our sneak previews this weekend said something totally different. ... but if you look at the empirical data, we’re nowhere.\" New York Magazine reported that the day prior to the film\\'s release, a long scene from Knight and Day was made available on iTunes, in an attempt to improve the lackluster 28–31% \"definite interest\" level of the movie. After results were reported from the film\\'s initial debut, FOX distribution executive Bruce Synder commented to The Hollywood Reporter, \"It\\'s an adult movie opening on a Wednesday, but we opened it there and snuck it on Saturday because we believe the word-of-mouth will be good, so we\\'re set for a pretty good opening weekend. Remember, it\\'s an original, adult movie, which we expect will run for quite a while.\"\\n\\nAlternative versions\\nAn \"extended cut\", which adds eight minutes of footage mostly extending  scenes and a new opening that better establishes June Haven\\'s profession as a car restorer, was released on Video On Demand in North America. As of January 2011 it had not been released in DVD region 1, though it had been released in regions 2, 3, and 4.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nKnight and Day grossed $76.4 million in the United States and Canada and $185.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $261.9 million. It performed poorly at the box office in its debut, with a take of US$3.8 million the day after its initial June 23, 2010, release, from ticket sales in the United States and Canada. This was much less than the film Toy Story 3, which earned $13 million at the box office on the same day. Knight and Day did not place within the top 50 all-time Wednesday film openings. An analysis of the opening day results by Box Office Mojo noted it was the worst attended action film debut for Tom Cruise since his appearance in the 1986 Legend. It was the lowest-grossing opening day for Cruise in a leading role since his performance in the 1992 film Far and Away. Cruise\\'s last starring role prior to Knight and Day, in the 2008 film Valkyrie, generated $8.5 million on its opening day. The previous film with Cameron Diaz and Cruise as the lead roles, Vanilla Sky, garnered $8.9 million on its opening day.Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times characterized the film\\'s initial revenue results as \"a box-office disappointment\"; Lou Lumenick of New York Post commented, \"Not great numbers\"; journalist Roger Friedman noted for Hollywood News, \"Bad reviews didn’t help. \\'K&D\\' has registered only 52% on Rotten Tomatoes. Even those reviews counted as positive weren’t so good. They were stretching.\"; Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly noted, \"audiences just aren’t showing up the way Fox might have hoped\"; and Ben Fritz of Los Angeles Times called the film\\'s debut a \"soft\" opening, and commented, \"It wasn\\'t a good first day or night at the box office for \\'Knight and Day.\\'\"The film\\'s revenues dropped nine percent on its second day of release, earning $3.5 million in ticket sales. During the same period that revenues dropped for Knight and Day, ticket sales for Toy Story only fell by three percent, The Karate Kid dropped by six percent; while other films increased revenues at the same time, including, Shrek Forever After, Sex and the City 2, Get Him to the Greek, Killers, and Robin Hood. In its first weekend, Knight and Day was paired up against Grown Ups, a comedy film starring Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider. The Friday of its first weekend after release, Knight and Day took third place at the box office, behind both Grown Ups and Toy Story 3. The film brought in a total of $6.4 million on its third day of release.\\n\\nCritical response\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 230 reviews and an average rating of 5.57/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"It\\'s pure formula, but thanks to its breezy pace and a pair of charming performances from Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, Knight and Day offers some agreeably middle-of-the-road summer action.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 46 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.The film received a negative review in Variety, with critic Justin Chang characterizing the film as \"a high-energy, low-impact caper-comedy that labors to bring a measure of wit, romance and glamour to an overworked spy-thriller template\". Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter summarized his review with, \"Bottom Line: Logic and plausibility take a holiday in this nonstop actioner that counts on stars Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz to sell the nonsense.\" Honeycutt wrote of the writing, \"the script is too lazy to develop any of its characters – and that includes the leads\", and commented, \"laziness permeates the film from the inexplicable escapes to the neglected romance\". Knight and Day received a rating of one and a half stars from a review by Michael Phillips in the Chicago Tribune; which criticized multiple aspects of the film, including its script, directing, cinematography, set pieces, and action sequences. Phillips concluded, \"A 21st Century Charade pumped up on all the wrong steroids, \\'Knight and Day\\' may well suffice for audiences desperate for the bankable paradox known as the predictable surprise, and willing to overlook a galumphing mediocrity in order to concentrate on matters of dentistry.\" Lexi Feinberg of Big Picture Big Sound gave the film a rating of one and a half stars, and characterized it as an \"asinine, action-adventure dud\", with a \"stupid plot\". Feinberg commented, \"\\'Knight and Day\\' is a ludicrous, large-scale failure\".In a review of the film for the New York Post, critic Lou Lumenick rated Knight and Day with one and a half out of four stars. Lumenick wrote, \"this is a big, dumb summer movie with no apparent ambition other than plugging a hole in a studio’s schedule because its faded star happened to be available for a few weeks.\" American film critic and professor Emanuel Levy was critical of the film\\'s writing, calling it a \"mindless flick\"; he noted, \"The story moves at a breakneck speed, as if to conceal the incongruities in the storytelling.\" Levy gave the film a grade of \"C\", and commented, \"Preposterously plotted, the saga is dominated by long, energetic, uneven action sequences, but it lacks any logic and pays minimal attention to characterization. Repetitious in structure, and with humor that more often than not misses the mark, \\'Knight and Day\\' is characterized by nihilistic violence and amoral tone, which wouldn\\'t have mattered had the movie been witty or fun to watch.\" Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine gave the film a rating of two stars out of four, and commented of the film\\'s director and writer, \"Clearly O\\'Neill and Mangold are trying to give viewers what producers would undoubtedly like to sell as \\'something for everybody,\\' but there\\'s no consistency to the thing and no chemistry whatsoever between Cruise and Diaz, making the alternating tug-of-war between girly and manly elements of the film seem extraordinarily forced.\" In a review published in The Victoria Advocate, Robert Philpot of McClatchy Newspapers called the movie \"disposable\", and singled out the film\\'s script as its \"biggest problem\", commenting that it \"feels lazy right from its lame-pun title\". The Miami Herald film critic Rene Rodriguez wrote that there was \"no chemistry between Cruise and Diaz\", and commented regarding Cruise\\'s acting, \"Tom Cruise spends much of \\'Knight and Day\\' looking as if he\\'s waiting for someone to pour casting mold over his head to make an action figure.\"Entertainment Weekly film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave Knight and Day a grade of \"C+\", and compared it to the 2010 film Killers starring Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher, \"The producers assume that audience interest in movie stars is bigger than audience interest in characters. The conclusion is overdetermined, since Roy and June are such flimsy constructions. ... At least they\\'re not Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher in Killers.\" Colin Covert of Star Tribune made a similar comparison, \"The film looks unambitious, like a remake of \\'Killers,\\' the Ashton Kutcher-Katherine Heigl guns-and-giggles toss-off everyone has already forgotten, but with bigger stunts and more star wattage.\" The film received a rating of two stars out of four from critic Peter Howell in the Toronto Star; the reviewer commented, \"There is supposed to be romance in Knight and Day — and Diaz is up for it — but Cruise still looks as if he’s taken charisma lessons from Al Gore.\" In a review for The Huffington Post, critic Marshall Fine observed, \"the movie bubbles happily for almost an hour before it flags\". Robert Bell of Exclaim! wrote of the script, \"Sure, things slow down a bit around the midway point, making it clear that there is very little going on here aside from cheesy escapist fantasy, but things quickly pick up again, engaging us in the moment of a movie that knows exactly what mainstream trash cinema should be.\" In a review for the Orlando Sentinel, critic Roger Moore commented, \"The blase plot devices (a gadget, the nerdy guy who invented it), the bland villains, the too-fast dash through exotic locales, don\\'t matter so long as Cruise and Diaz click and spark their scenes – chases and embraces – to life. And Cruise, hurling himself at this as if his Mission: Impossible future and indeed his whole career depended on it, makes sure they do.\"The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern commented, \"\\'Knight and Day\\' woke me up to just how awful some summer entertainments have become. It isn\\'t that the film is harmful, except to moviegoers\\' wallets and movie lovers\\' morale, but that it is truly phenomenal for the purity of its incoherence.\" Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert rated the movie 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, \"\\'Knight and Day\\' aspires to the light charm of a romantic action comedy like \\'Charade\\' or \\'Romancing the Stone,\\' but would come closer if it dialed down the relentless action. The romance part goes without saying after a Meet Cute contrived in an airport, and the comedy seems to generate naturally between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. But why do so many summer movies find it obligatory to inflict us with CGI overkill? I\\'d sorta rather see Diaz and Cruise in action scenes on a human scale, rather than have it rubbed in that for long stretches, they\\'re essentially replaced by animation.\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe stated, \"The movie’s a piece of high-octane summer piffle: stylish, funny, brainless without being too obnoxious about it, and Cruise is its manic animating principle.\" Writing for the Associated Press, Christy Lemire commented, \"Cruise\\'s presence also helps keep things light, breezy and watchable when the action – and the story itself – spin ridiculously out of control.\" Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic observed, \"Mangold, working from a script by Patrick O\\'Neill, accelerates events in a way that is either a perfect representation of how current action films are made or a demonstration of everything that\\'s wrong with movies today. Maybe it\\'s both.\" Joshua Starnes of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 6.5 out of 10, and concluded his review, \"Instead of watching it, you\\'re better off putting \"Knight and Day\" in a time capsule and singing some Don McLean, \\'cause this is the day the movie star died.\" In a subsequent \"mini review\", Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, and concluded, \"The entertainment comes from how much fun it is watching [Cruise and Diaz] on screen together and that\\'s what separates Knight and Day from previous attempts at mixing romance, comedy, and action.\" In a review for CNN, Tom Charity commented, \"there\\'s a creeping anxiety about this project, a tendency to over-compensate that speaks to underlying inadequacies.\"\\n\\nSee also\\nBang Bang!, 2014 Bollywood film and remake of Knight and Day\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website\\nKnight and Day at AllMovie\\nKnight and Day at Box Office Mojo\\nKnight and Day at IMDb\\nKnight and Day at the TCM Movie Database\\nKnight and Day at Metacritic\\nKnight and Day at Rotten Tomatoes\\nKnight and Day Soundtrack',\n",
              " 'Legal drama': 'A legal drama, or a courtroom drama, is a genre of film and television that generally focuses on narratives regarding legal practice and the justice system. The American Film Institute (AFI) defines \"courtroom drama\" as a genre of film in which a system of justice plays a critical role in the film\\'s narrative. Legal dramas have also followed the lives of the fictional attorneys, defendants, plaintiffs, or other persons related to the practice of law present in television show or film. Legal drama is distinct from police crime drama or detective fiction, which typically focus on police officers or detectives investigating and solving crimes. The focal point of legal dramas, more often, are events occurring within a courtroom, but may include any phases of legal procedure, such as jury deliberations or work done at law firms. Some legal dramas fictionalize real cases that have been litigated, such as the play-turned-movie, Inherit the Wind, which fictionalized the Scopes Monkey Trial. As a genre, the term \"legal drama\"  is typically applied to television shows and films, whereas legal thrillers typically refer to novels and plays.\\n\\nThemes\\nLegal dramas typical portray moral dilemmas that occur with the practice of the law or participating in the justice system, many of which mirrors dilemmas in real life. The American Bar Association Journal has interpreted the public\\'s enjoyment of legal dramas occur because \"stories about the legal system are laced with human vulnerability.\" Indeed, even though \"there are no car chases [and]... [g]uns are never drawn\", legal dramas retain strong followings because of their presentation of moral intrigue in a setting that actually reflects what occurs in the world.\\nLegal dramas may present stories of the miscarriages of justice, such as persons wrongly convicted of a crime they did not commit. At times, stories may involve the moral implications of police misconduct, such as placing or tampering with evidence, such as in the 1993 film In the Name of the Father. More often, legal dramas focus on the attorneys\\' point of view when faced with these difficulties. For instance, in The Practice, a television legal drama series revolving around a firm of criminal defense attorneys, a common theme presented is the difficulty of defending clients known or believed to be guilty.Finally, many legal dramas present themes that reflect politicized issues. In the 1960 film, Inherit the Wind, the politicized issue portrayed was the legality of a Tennessee statute that made it unlawful to teach the theory of evolution in a public school. As laws and public policy opinions change, so do the themes presented in legal dramas. The 1992 filmA Few Good Men explored the psychology of superior orders, e.g. excusing criminal actions because they were only committed from \\'following orders\\'. The film Philadelphia (1993) addressed homophobia, and the discrimination and public fear of HIV/AIDs carriers. In 1996, The People vs. Larry Flynt portrays the early years of Hustler Magazine and issues of obscenity and freedom of speech. You Don\\'t Know Jack (2010) is a fictional biographic film about Dr. Jack Kevorkian and the legal actions he faced as a result of providing euthanasia services to terminal patients. Racial injustice remains a common theme from as far back as To Kill a Mockingbird in 1962 to the 2017 film Marshall.\\n\\nFilm\\nLegal dramas in American film has an extensive history stemming from as early as the 1908 film, Falsely Accused! The 1950s and 1960s presented a number of legal drama films including, 12 Angry Men (1957), Witness for the Prosecution (1957), I Want to Live! (1958), Anatomy of a Murder (1959), The Young Philadelphians (1959), Compulsion (1959), Inherit the Wind (1960), Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). Arguably, 12 Angry Men and To Kill a Mockingbird stand as the cornerstones of early legal dramas, garnering extensive acclaim, recognition, and awards. Despite underwhelming box office performance, 12 Angry Men was nominated in three different categories at the 30th Academy Awards and appears on half of the AFI 100 Years... series lists of films, which celebrate the greatest films in American cinema. Likewise, To Kill a Mockingbird received even more acclaim, garnering three academy awards out of eight total nominations at the 35th Academy Awards, appears on seven of the AFI\\'s ten lists celebrating the greatest films, including ranking as the best courtroom drama, and selected for preservation United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".  Other countries also premiered legal dramas or courtrooms dramas in the early 1900s, such as the French silent film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928).Other legal drama films have not focused on even the practice of law, such as Paper Chase, a film presenting the difficulty and anxiety of entering law school.Legal thrillers include:\\n\\nTelevision\\nEarly American television programs considered legal dramas include Perry Mason, The Defenders, JUDD for the Defense, Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law, Petrocelli, and Matlock. More recent examples of serious legal dramas are Murder One, The Practice, Law & Order, L.A. Law and Pearson.\\nThe examples of legal comedy-dramas are Ally McBeal and Boston Legal, both of which David E. Kelley created and produced, with Suits as the most popular legal drama currently.Legal dramas are becoming more in demand from the public, more popular for many people to watch, and beginning to feature stronger female leads.\\n\\nInaccurate portrayal of legal practice\\nIt is widely believed by most practicing lawyers that legal dramas result in the general public having misconceptions about the legal process. Many of these misconceptions result from the desire to create an interesting story. For example, because conflict between parties make for an interesting story, legal dramas emphasize the trial and ignore the fact that the vast majority of civil and criminal cases in the United States are settled out of court. Trials in legal dramas are often shown to be more emphatic by disregarding actual rules in trials that prevent prejudicing defendants from juries.\\nBesides the actual practice of law, legal dramas may also misrepresent the character of lawyers in general. Some fictional lawyers may be portrayed as ambulance chasers, breaching rules of professional conduct by seeking out potential personal injury plaintiffs. Lawyers may also be portrayed as amoral, seeking only to win or financial gain, rather than do what is \"morally\" right. These negative portrayals reflect a long-standing cultural perception of lawyers since time immemorial. Another misrepresented character trait of attorneys portrayed by legal dramas is their sexual appetite. Characters such as Bobby Donnell and Ally McBeal portray lawyers who seemingly cannot keep from having sex with clients, colleagues, opposing counsel, or judges. Although attorneys appear a top preferred occupation for potential dating partners according to Bumble and Tinder, the Model Rules of Professional Conduct preclude lawyers from many of the relations portrayed in television.\\nSpeaking at a screening of 12 Angry Men during the 2010 Fordham University Law School Film festival, US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that seeing 12 Angry Men while she was in college influenced her decision to pursue a career in law. She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11\\'s monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film\\'s example, because most of the jurors\\' conclusions are based on speculation, not fact. Sotomayor noted that events from the film such as entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt would not be allowed in a real-life jury situation, and would in fact have yielded a mistrial (assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).\\n\\nSee also\\nBleak House\\nCourtroom drama films\\nCrime comics\\nCrime fiction\\nDetective fiction\\nDramatized court show\\nLegal television series\\nList of police television dramas\\nPolice procedural\\nTrial film\\nWhodunit\\n\\nNotes\\nFurther reading\\nBergman, Paul; Asimow, Michael.

              " 'Legend (1985 film)': 'Legend is a 1985 American epic dark fantasy adventure film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Tom Cruise, Mia Sara, Tim Curry, David Bennent, Alice Playten, Billy Barty, Cork Hubbert, and Annabelle Lanyon. The film revolves around Jack, a pure being who must stop the Lord of Darkness who plots to cover the world with eternal night. It is often described as a dark fairy tale and as a return to more original and sometimes disturbing fables originating from the oral tradition of ancient times before reading and writing were widespread.Although not a commercial success when first released, it won the British Society of Cinematographers Award for Best Cinematography in 1985 for cinematographer Alex Thomson, as well as being nominated for multiple awards: Oscar for Best Makeup; Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films Saturn Award for Best Makeup; BAFTA Awards for Best Costume Design, Best Makeup Artist, Best Special Visual Effects; DVD Exclusive Awards; and Young Artist Awards. Since its premiere and the subsequent release of the unrated Director\\'s Cut, the film has become a cult classic.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn order to cast the world into eternal night, the Lord of Darkness sends the goblin Blix on a mission to kill the unicorns in the forest near his castle that guard the light and bring him their horns. Blix and his colleagues Pox and Blunder follow impetuous Princess Lily as she visits her forest-dwelling paramour Jack O\\'Greene. Later, Jack blindfolds and takes Lily to the lair of the unicorns. As Lily distracts the stallion by stroking it, Blix shoots it with a poison dart from his blowpipe, and the unicorns flee. With the couple unaware of the goblins, Lily makes light of Jack\\'s fears concerning her sin and sets him a challenge by throwing her ring into a pond, declaring she will marry whoever finds it. While Jack dives in after the ring, the goblins find the dying stallion and sever its alicorn. An apocalyptic winter descends; Lily runs off in terror and Jack is barely able to break through the surface of the now frozen pond.\\nLily takes refuge in the frozen cottage of a kind and friendly family. There, Lily sees the goblins testing the alicorn\\'s magical powers, and overhears from them about how she had a role in their slaying of the stallion, and by doing so, casting the dark winter onto the world. She follows the goblins to a rendezvous with Darkness, who tells them the world cannot be cast into eternal night as long as the surviving mare still lives. Blunder valiantly but unsuccessfully tries using the alicorn to overthrow Darkness and is taken away to his castle. Meanwhile, Jack, accompanied by the forest elf Honeythorn Gump, the fairy Oona, and the dwarves Brown Tom and Screwball, finds the mare mourning the lifeless stallion. Lamenting over his role in their current predicament, Jack cries and apologizes to the mare, who tells him the alicorn must be recovered and returned to the stallion. Leaving Brown Tom to guard the unicorns, Jack and the others retrieve a hidden cache of ancient weapons and armor. While they are gone, Lily tries to help make things right by helping to save the mare from the goblins, but they overpower Tom and capture both the mare and Lily. Learning of what has transpired, Jack and his group make their way to the castle in the middle of a swamp. On the way, they are nearly killed by a swamp hag named Meg Mucklebones, but defeat her by flattering her appearance and then decapitating her.\\nAfter reaching the castle, Jack\\'s group falls into an underground prison cell in a hellish kitchen. They encounter Blunder in the same cell, revealed to be an elf gone astray, before he is dragged off by an ogre cook to be baked into a pie. Oona offers to use her magic to escape their cell and retrieve keys to free the others if she receives a kiss from Jack. He is tempted when Oona turns into an amorous Lily, but refuses to follow through, telling her \"human hearts don\\'t work that way\". Oona is greatly offended and scolds Jack, reminding him it was his lust that caused the apocalypse. Despite this, she remembers what\\'s at stake and frees everyone so they can all search for Lily and the mare.\\nHaving fallen in love with Lily, Darkness tempts her with jewelry, a beautiful dress and promises of power and glory. Seemingly seduced, she agrees to wed him under the condition that she will be the one to kill the mare in the upcoming ritual. Overhearing their conversation, Jack and Gump learn that Darkness can be destroyed by daylight. After saving Blunder, the group takes the ogres\\' giant metal platters to reflect the sunlight to the chamber where the mare is to be sacrificed.\\nAs the ritual begins, Lily frees the mare, but is knocked out by Darkness. While the others relay the light of the setting sun using the platters, Jack fights Darkness, finally wounding him with the severed alicorn. As the redirected sunlight blasts him to the edge of a void, Darkness warns them that because evil lurks in everyone, he will never truly be vanquished. Jack hesitates as he realizes this to be true, but overcomes his doubt and severs the evil hand holding the alicorn, thus expelling him into the void. Gump returns the stallion\\'s horn, returning him to life and ending the winter. Jack retrieves the mystic ring from the pond and returns it to Lily, returning her to life.\\n\\nAlternate endings\\nThere are three different versions of the film’s conclusion:\\n\\nIn the Director\\'s Cut, Lily wakes with Jack trying to convince her she was merely dreaming, but she is ultimately unconvinced. They confess their true love for each other, but realize they live in two different lifestyles, which causes Lily to request continuing a merely platonic relationship. Jack, happy with this request for the first time, accepts. Lily returns to her home to assume her responsibilities, promising to visit him again. Jack happily runs off into the sunset, hailed by the forest fairies and the revived unicorns.\\nIn the American theatrical version, Jack and Lily assure each other of their love and watch the unicorns reunite, and they run off into the sunset together, hailed by the forest fairies and the unicorns. Darkness watches them from the void, laughing.\\nThe European version also ends with both Jack and Lily running off into the sunset, but without Darkness\\'s final appearance.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Jack O\\' the Green (Jack), a green man of the forest\\nMia Sara as Princess Lily\\nTim Curry as the Lord of Darkness \\nDavid Bennent as Honeythorn Gump, an elf and guardian of the forest\\nAlice Playten as Blix, the leader of Darkness\\'s goblin minions\\nBilly Barty as Screwball\\nCork Hubbert as Brown Tom\\nPeter O\\'Farrell as Pox\\nKiran Shah as Blunder\\nAnnabelle Lanyon as Oona, a fairy\\nRobert Picardo as Meg Mucklebones\\nTina Martin as Nell, a clockmaker\\'s wife living at the edge of the forestCast notes:\\n\\nAlice Playten is also the uncredited voice of Gump, because an executive thought that Bennent\\'s voice sounded too German.\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nWhile filming The Duellists in France, Ridley Scott conceived Legend after another planned project, Tristan and Isolde, fell through temporarily. However, he believed that it would be an art film with limited audience appeal and went on to make Alien and did pre-production work on Dune, another halted project, which was eventually finished by director David Lynch. Frustrated, he came back to the idea of filming a fairy tale or mythological story.\\nFor inspiration, Scott read all the classic fairy tales, including ones by the Brothers Grimm. From that, he conceived a story about a young hermit who is transformed into a hero when he battles the Darkness in order to rescue a beautiful princess and release the world from a wintery curse.\\n\\nScreenplay\\nScott wanted Legend to have an original screenplay because he believed that \"it was far easier to design a story to fit the medium of cinema than bend the medium for an established story\". By chance, he discovered several books written by American novelist William Hjortsberg, and found that the writer had already written several scripts for some unmade lower-budgeted films. Scott asked him if he was interested in writing a fairy tale. He was already writing some and agreed. Scott remembers, \"The first notion was to actually make a classical fairy story, but if you actually analyze a classical fairy story, most are either very short, or very complex\". The two men bonded over Jean Cocteau\\'s 1946 film of Beauty and the Beast. In January 1981, just before beginning principal photography on Blade Runner, Scott spent five weeks with Hjortsberg working out a rough storyline for what was then called Legend of Darkness.\\nOriginally, Scott \"only had the vague notion of something in pursuit of the swiftest steed alive which, of course, was the unicorn\". Scott felt that they should have a quest and wanted unicorns as well as magic armor and a sword. Hjortsberg suggested plunging the world into wintery darkness. Hjortsberg\\'s first draft of Legend of Darkness also had Princess Lily slowly transform into a clawed and fur-covered beast who is whipped and sexually seduced by the antagonist (called Baron Couer De Noir in this draft). Scott wanted to show the outside world as little as possible and they settled on the clockmaker\\'s cottage.\\nInitially, the quest was longer, but it was eventually substantially reduced. Scott wanted to avoid too many subplots that departed from the main story and go for a \"more contemporary movement rather than get bogged down in too classical a format\". By the time Scott had finished Blade Runner, he and Hjortsberg had a script that was \"lengthy, hugely expensive, and impractical in its size and scope\". They went through it and took out large sections that were secondary to the story. The two men went through 15 script revisions.\\n\\nPre-production\\nThe look Scott envisioned for Legend was influenced by the style of Disney animation. He had even offered the project to Disney, but they were intimidated by the film\\'s dark tone at a time when Disney still focused on family-friendly material. Visually, Scott referenced films like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia and Pinocchio. The look of Legend was also influenced by the art of Arthur Rackham and Heath Robinson. Scott had initially sought the services of conceptual designer Brian Froud, but was turned down. He then hired Alan Lee as a visual consultant, who drew some characters and sketched environments. However, Scott eventually replaced Lee with Assheton Gorton, a production designer whom he had wanted for both Alien and Blade Runner. Scott hired Gorton because he knew \"all the pitfalls of shooting exteriors on a soundstage. We both knew that whatever we did would never look absolutely real, but would very quickly gain its own reality and dispense with any feeling of theatricality\".Scott also consulted with effects expert Richard Edlund because the director did not want to limit major character roles to the number of smaller people who could act. At one point, the director considered Mickey Rooney to play one of the major characters but he did not look small enough next to Tom Cruise. Edlund considered shooting on 70 mm film stock, taking the negative, and reducing the actors to any size they wanted—but this was deemed too expensive. Thus, Scott was tasked with finding an ensemble of small actors. Legend would be financed with a budget of $24.5 million, and would be distributed by Universal Pictures in North America and by 20th Century Fox in all other territories.\\n\\nIn order to achieve the look of Legend that he wanted, Scott scouted locations in the Sequoias of Yosemite National Park to see the grand scale of trees there. \"The whole environment is so stunning ... It was so impressive, but I didn\\'t know how you would control it\".  However, it would cost too much to shoot on location and he decided to build a forest set on the 007 Stage, named after and used for many James Bond films, at Pinewood Studios. The crew spent 14 weeks constructing the forest set, and Scott was worried that it would not look real enough. It was only days before the start of principal photography that it looked good enough to film. The trees were 60 feet high with trunks 30 feet in diameter and were sculpted out of polystyrene built onto tubular scaffolding frames. In addition, other sets were constructed on five huge soundstages.\\n\\nCasting\\nJohnny Depp, Jim Carrey and Robert Downey Jr. were considered for the role of Jack. While Scott was considering Richard O\\'Brien to play Meg Mucklebones, he watched The Rocky Horror Picture Show and saw Tim Curry. He thought the actor would be ideal to play Darkness because the actor had film and theatrical experience. Tim Curry\\'s makeup as Darkness in Legend is considered to be one of the most iconic images in all of fantasy cinema. Scott discovered Mia Sara in a casting session and was impressed by her \"good theatrical instincts\".\\n\\nMakeup effects\\nScott contacted Rob Bottin, who designed the special makeup effects for The Howling, about working on Blade Runner, but Bottin was already committed to John Carpenter\\'s The Thing. Scott told him about Legend, and toward the end of production on The Thing, Bottin read a script for the film and saw an excellent opportunity to create characters in starring roles.\\nAfter wrapping his work with Carpenter, Bottin met with Scott to reduce the thousands of creatures suggested by the script to a manageable quantity. The process would involve complicated prosthetic makeup that would be worn for up to 60 days with some full body prosthetics. According to Bottin, at the time, Legend had the largest makeup crew ever dedicated to one project. Bottin divided his facility into different shops in order to cover the immense workload. As actors were cast, Bottin and his crew began making life casts and designed characters on drafting paper laid over sketches of the actors\\' faces. He designed the prosthetics in his Los Angeles studio and spent some time in England occasionally helping with the application of makeup.\\n\\nWith the exception of Cruise and Sara, all the principal actors spent hours every morning having extensive makeup applied. Between 8 and 12 prosthetic pieces were applied individually to each face, then made up, molded and grafted into the actor\\'s face so that the prosthetics moved with their muscles. Each person needed three makeup artists working on them for an average time of three and a half hours spent applying prosthetics. Actor Tim Curry took five and a half hours because his entire body was encased in makeup, the film\\'s most challenging character design.Curry had to wear a large, bull-like structure atop his head with three-foot fiberglass horns supported by a harness underneath the makeup. The initial design of the horns placed a strain on the back of the actor\\'s neck because they extended forward and not straight up but Bottin and his crew eventually reduced the weight of the horns. At the end of the day, he spent an hour in a bath in order to liquefy the soluble spirit gum. At one point, Curry became claustrophobic, got too impatient, and pulled the makeup off too quickly, tearing off his own skin in the process. Scott had to shoot around the actor for a week as a result.\\n\\nPrincipal photography\\nPrincipal photography began on March 26, 1984 on the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios. On June 27, 1984, with ten days filming left on this stage, the entire set burned down during a lunch break. Reportedly, flames from the set fire leapt more than 100 feet into the air and the clouds of smoke could be seen five miles away. It occurred during lunchtime, and no one was hurt. Scott quickly made changes to the shooting schedule and only lost three days moving to another soundstage. Meanwhile, the art department rebuilt the section of the forest set that was needed to complete filming. Due to the fire, the scenes of Lily meeting the unicorns for the first time and finding the cottages in the snow were filmed in the garden of the main house behind Shepperton Studios. The underwater scenes were filmed in Silver Springs, Florida for the \"purity\" of the water. Cruise did all his own diving and swimming in waters that, according to Scott, had real alligators 25 feet from where they were filming.\\n\\nPost-production\\nScott\\'s first cut of Legend ran 125 minutes long. He then believed there were minor plot points that could be trimmed and cut the film down to 113 minutes, so he tested this version for an audience in Orange County. However, it was decided that the audience had to work too much to be entertained, and another 20 minutes was cut. The 95-minute version was shown in Great Britain and then the film was cut down even further to 89 minutes for North America.\\nAt the time, Scott said, \"European audiences are more sophisticated. They accepted preambles and subtleties whereas the U.S. goes for a much broader stroke.\" He and Universal delayed the North American theatrical release until 1986 so that they could replace Jerry Goldsmith\\'s score with music by Tangerine Dream, Yes lead singer Jon Anderson, and Bryan Ferry.Scott allowed Goldsmith\\'s score to remain on European prints and the composer said, \"that this dreamy, bucolic setting is suddenly to be scored by a techno-pop group seems sort of strange to me\". Normally, Goldsmith would spend 6–10 weeks on a film score, but for Legend, he spent six months writing songs and dance sequences ahead of time.In 2000, Universal unearthed an answer print of the 113-minute preview cut with Jerry Goldsmith\\'s score. This print had minor visual anomalies that were eventually digitally replaced, occasionally with finished shots from the 89-minute U.S. version. This edition is Scott\\'s preferred 2002 \"Director\\'s Cut\", with the restored Jerry Goldsmith soundtracks. The Director\\'s Cut\\'s source is one of only two prints of this extended version known to exist, used for Universal\\'s 2002 DVD (and eventual Blu-ray) \"Ultimate Edition.\"\\n\\nReception\\nLegend received mixed reviews. The film currently holds a 38% \"Rotten\" approval rating on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 4.87/10. The consensus reads: \"Not even Ridley Scott\\'s gorgeously realized set pieces can save Legend from its own tawdry tale -- though it may be serviceable for those simply looking for fantasy eye candy.\" Steve Biodrowski of Cinefantastique praised the film, highlighting the makeup design by Rob Bottin and Tim Curry\\'s performance as Darkness, saying that \"[b]ecause of the visuals (and Curry\\'s performance, which is mostly limited to the last 20 minutes), the film is worth seeing\". Widgett Walls of needcoffee.com also praised the film, once again highlighting Bottin\\'s makeup, focusing on the character of Darkness, saying simply that \"Tim Curry\\'s Darkness is absolutely incredible.\"Vincent Canby of The New York Times said that \"[i]t\\'s a slap-dash amalgam of Old Testament, King Arthur, \"The Lord of the Rings\" and any number of comic books.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised the visuals as \"a sumptuous, richly colored feast for cinematographer Alex Gordon\\'s camera\", but thought the film \"surely could have used more humor and invention\". Kim Newman of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that \"like Blade Runner before it, the film suffers so much from an over-emphasis on details at the expense of the actual story that it becomes a plodding bore.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film half of one star out of four and stated that writing the review was \"akin to recalling a bad dream\", concluding that \"I don\\'t want to remember any more about Legend than to make sure I include it in my \\'worst films of 1986\\' list and never rent it when it comes out as a video cassette.\" The film has been described as the \"extinction event\" that discouraged Hollywood from making fantasy films.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Bottin\\'s makeup and Assheton Gorton\\'s set design and the performances of Tim Curry and Tom Cruise, but noted that the effects were so good that the roles could have been played by almost anyone.  Ebert also said that the movie was composed of all of the right ingredients to be successful, but that the film simply \"doesn\\'t work\". He went on to say that \"[a]ll of the special effects in the world, and all of the great makeup, and all of the great Muppet creatures can\\'t save a movie that has no clear idea of its own mission and no joy in its own accomplishment\". However, with the release of the 2002 Director\\'s Cut, he agreed with many fans on how it was intended to question the balance between good and evil, and gives the main characters moral flaws to display the imperfections of humans. The release of the Director\\'s Cut in 2002 also had the original score from Jerry Goldsmith restored, and brought renewed attention to the film. Both Ridley Scott and Tom Cruise have requested their fans to view this version, even to the extent of Cruise disowning the US version entirely as a \"stereotypical 80\\'s fantasy\".Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"C+\" on scale of A+ to F.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nDue to the changes in the film from its European and American releases, Legend has two different soundtracks. The first, produced, composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, was used for its initial European release and restored in the director\\'s cut edition of the Region 1 DVD release. The second soundtrack features music by German electronic artists Tangerine Dream and was used for the initial theatrical and home video releases in the United States. This soundtrack also includes songs by Jon Anderson of Yes and Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music.\\nThe following songs are featured in the European and Director\\'s Cuts, with lyrics composed by John Bettis (composer of many Carpenters songs) and music by Jerry Goldsmith:\\n\\n\"My True Love\\'s Eyes\" (the main theme, sung mostly by Lily. Mia Sara provided some of the singing, while session singers provided vocals wherever Sara was unable to perform).\\n\"Living River\" (the first reprise of \"My True Love\\'s Eyes\", sung as Lily calls to the unicorn).\\n\"Bumps and Hollows\" (sung by Lily after her forbidden act of touching a unicorn).\\n\"Sing The Wee\" (the theme for the fairies. The first sung version was cut from all editions of the film as it accompanied a scene with Jack and the fairies that was itself cut; the final sung version by the National Philharmonic Chorus is heard over the end credits).\\n\"Reunited\" (the final reprise of \"My True Love\\'s Eyes\", sung by Lily as she says goodbye to Jack).The following songs appeared in the 89-minute U.S. re-cut when it was re-scored by Tangerine Dream:\\n\\n\"Loved by the Sun\" (music by Tangerine Dream, lyrics written and sung by Jon Anderson).\\n\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\" (written and performed by Bryan Ferry over the U.S. print\\'s end credits).A promotional music video (presumably for the U.S. market, where the Tangerine Dream soundtrack was used) was created for the Bryan Ferry song \"Is Your Love Strong Enough\".  The video, which incorporates Ferry and guitarist David Gilmour into footage from the film, is included as a bonus on disc 2 of the 2002 \"Ultimate Edition\" DVD release.\\n\\nHome media\\nIn 2002, Universal released the 113-minute Director\\'s Cut on Region 1 DVD, restoring previously cut scenes and the original Goldsmith score.\\nThe Director\\'s Cut was a nightmare to track down. In doing research on this, I had been in contact with a certifiable Legend fanatic named Sean Murphy, who runs the Legend FAQ along with Geoff Wright, and based in part on his info, and a lot of background from Legend editor, Terry Rawlings, I realized that we were looking for one of three cuts. ... Credit really needs to be given to Garth Thomas for breaking the case. And I should also thank Sean Murphy, Geoff Wright, and Paul MacLean for all of their support.\\nUniversal released a Blu-ray version of the \"Ultimate Edition\" on May 31, 2011. With the exception of the 2002 DVD-ROM features, this disc carries over all the content from the DVD, including the Jerry Goldsmith-scored \"Director\\'s Cut\" and the Tangerine Dream-scored theatrical version.\\n20th Century Fox – the international rights holder – has released a Blu-ray issue for Region 2 of both the 94-minute European version and the 113-minute Director\\'s Cut, both with Jerry Goldsmith\\'s music.\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nLegend at IMDb\\nLegend at AllMovie\\nLegend at Box Office Mojo\\nLegend at Rotten Tomatoes\\nRidley Scott\\'s LEGEND FAQ',\n",
              " 'Lestat de Lioncourt': 'Lestat de Lioncourt [lɛ.stat də ljɔ̃.kuʁ] is a fictional character appearing in several novels by Anne Rice, including The Vampire Lestat (1985). He is a vampire and an antihero in the majority of The Vampire Chronicles.\\n\\nPublication history\\nLestat is introduced in Rice\\'s 1976 novel Interview with the Vampire, the first book of what would become The Vampire Chronicles. His full backstory is explored in The Vampire Lestat (1985), which follows Lestat\\'s exploits from his youth in the Auvergne region of France to his early years as a vampire fledgling. Lestat is the lead character in most novels in the main series, including The Queen of the Damned (1988), The Tale of the Body Thief (1992), Memnoch the Devil (1995), The Vampire Armand (1998), and Blood Canticle (2003). Rice later revisited the Lestat-centric series, starting with Prince Lestat (2014), followed by Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis (2016) and Blood Communion: A Tale of Prince Lestat (2018).\\n\\nCharacter development\\nAccording to Rice, Lestat was largely inspired by her husband, the poet and artist Stan Rice; both have blond hair and they share November 7 as a birth date. In a 2003 interview, Rice noted that the character had also taken on some of her own attributes, stating \"Stan was Lestat; he was the inspiration. Perhaps it is best to say Lestat was Stan and me. He was Stan and what Stan taught me. Lestat was inspired by Stan, and then I became Lestat.\" The name \"Lestat\" was a misspelling of \"Lestan,\" which Rice believed to be an old Louisianan name. According to the characters themselves, who discuss the issue in Blackwood Farm, Blood Canticle and Memnoch the Devil, the name is pronounced \"les-dot\" \"with a rather French flair.\"\\n\\nFictional character biography\\nPhysical appearance\\nLestat describes himself as six feet tall. He has blond hair that is not quite shoulder length, and that is rather curly, which sometimes appears white under fluorescent lighting. His eyes are gray, but they reflect the colors of blue or violet easily from surfaces around them. He has a short narrow nose, and a mouth that is well shaped, but has always been slightly large for his face. His mouth can look very mean or extremely generous, but always sensual. He has a continuously animated face. Lestat\\'s fingernails (like those of all vampires in The Vampire Chronicles) look like they are made of glass.\\n\\nPersonality\\nBecause of his boldness, enthusiasm, and defiance, Lestat\\'s seniors refer to him affectionately as \"The Brat Prince\", a title of which he is very fond. He is very vain and concerned with fashion, and will pause mid-narrative to remind the reader what he is wearing. He enjoys performing on stage, which he does as both a mortal actor in Paris, France and a vampire in his rock band called The Vampire Lestat, that he forms with a group of humans in the 1980s. Lestat is also fond of music; he sings and plays the piano and violin. Although he is illiterate as a mortal man, he learns to read and loves literature as a vampire. In one period of his life, he becomes a hermit and spends every night holed up at home, reading.\\nThe first language that Lestat learns is French, although he \"writes\" his novels in English. In The Vampire Lestat, he notes that despite his French accent, he speaks English \"like a cross between a boatman and Sam Spade\" and is fond of slang.\\nLestat is portrayed in the books as being bisexual, and has male and female lovers as both a vampire and a mortal. He is attracted to whoever most interests him at the time. Most of his early experiences are with male companions; he himself explains this by saying the women in previous centuries simply were not as interesting as men. Later in the series, Lestat offhandedly mentions that he is frightened of women and finds them extremely and egregiously distracting.\\nThroughout his long life, Lestat is plagued by common philosophical questions, such as \"Are my actions good or bad?\", \"Is there a God?\", \"Am I in His plan?\", \"What happens after death?\", and \"What makes a person happy?\" He finds himself more in love with humanity than ever before, despite his relationship with mankind being savage. For a while, he sees life as \"the Savage Garden\", filled with beauty and death.\\nLestat exhibits a strong altruistic nature at several points in the series. For instance, after he first becomes a vampire, he sends large gifts to his family and friends, purchases the theatre where he once worked, and settles the debts of his old manager, Renaud. Later, after his brothers and family are killed in the French Revolution, he steps forward to care for his ailing father, the only survivor, despite their hateful relationship. Lestat also frequently hunts evildoers instead of feeding from innocent victims, although he does not always abide by this rule.\\nAs a vampire, Lestat\\'s abilities include telepathy, mind reading, superhuman physical attributes, and rapid healing. After receiving blood from several ancient vampires, including Magnus, Marius de Romanus, and Akasha, Lestat\\'s strength increases dramatically and allows him to fly, perform feats of telekinesis and pyrokinesis, and survive exposure to the sun. After Lestat ate the brain of Mekare, he was infused with the spirit of Amel and became the Host of the Sacred Core, effectively making himself the most powerful vampire on the planet.\\nAlthough he is painted as an anti-hero in Interview with the Vampire, he is quick to defend his own behavior. In The Vampire Lestat, he spends much of the book telling people he is hardly the monster previous narrators have made him out to be. In much of the book, (and its follow up, Queen of the Damned), he is instead painted as a fun-loving hero who even leads the charge against Akasha, the vampire queen.\\n\\nHistory\\nLestat was born on November 7, 1760, as the seventh son of the marquis d\\'Auvergne in the Auvergne region of France. Only two of his brothers survive to adulthood. While they are technically aristocrats, the de Lioncourt family\\'s fortune has been squandered, and they live in relative poverty in their feudal castle. Lestat\\'s mother, Gabrielle, is the only literate member of the family. Lestat\\'s father is blind and spends his days playing chess.\\nLestat\\'s relationships with his father and brothers are bad - he tells his mother \"I dream sometimes that I might kill them all. I kill my father and my brothers in the dream. I go from room to room slaughtering them as I did the wolves.\" He attempts to escape from them several times, first by asking to remain at a monastery, and later by running away with a troupe of traveling players. In both instances, he is returned to his family. Encouraged by his mother, who sells her family heirloom jewels to purchase horses, guns, and mastiff dogs for him, Lestat takes up hunting, and soon becomes the family breadwinner.\\nThe townspeople of Lestat\\'s village request his help with a pack of wolves that are terrorizing the town. He rides into the mountains and kills the entire pack of eight, losing his horse, dogs, and nearly his own life in the process. Although his bravery wins him the respect and admiration of the villagers, who present him with a lush red velvet cloak and boots made from the pelts of the wolves, he goes into a deep depression.\\nProdded by Gabrielle, he eventually leaves Auvergne with friend and lover Nicolas and heads for Paris, intending to become an actor. During performances, he attracts the attention of an ancient vampire named Magnus, who later abducts him and transforms him into a vampire against his will.\\nImmediately after turning Lestat, Magnus commits suicide, leaving Lestat to fend for himself without any kind of guidance. Lestat finds himself heir to a nearly inexhaustible fortune, and begins an adventure that leads him all around the world.\\n\\nRelationships with other characters\\nDespite his charisma, Lestat is portrayed as a lonesome individual. In his childhood, the only member of his family who he had any connection with was his mother, Gabrielle. She is the only member of the family who could read, and she often immersed herself in novels, neglecting the mundane life around her. Lestat both admires and hates her for this, yet he is the only person of her family she can confide in; they develop a silent but strong bond. For this very reason Lestat makes a dying Gabrielle his first vampire companion when she comes to Paris in search of her son, wishing to see him before she succumbs to consumption.\\nLestat also makes his friend and lover, Nicolas de Lenfent, a vampire. They find work at a small theatre called \"Renaud\\'s\". Lestat starts off as a stage hand and then, to his surprise, becomes star of the show when he steps in for another actor. Nicolas is a violinist and performs with the theatre\\'s small orchestra. After Lestat is abducted and made a vampire, he tries to distance himself from his mortal friends and family, but he still provides for them. He buys Nicolas an apartment and many other luxuries, such as a Stradivarius violin, with his newly acquired \"coin of the realm\". Nicolas is suspicious, and insists that Lestat was in fact abducted from their room at night, calling out to Nicolas. Lestat gives in to the love he feels for Nicolas and makes him a vampire as well after saving him from the self-proclaimed Children of Darkness, a coven of vampires led by Armand. But Nicolas rejects Lestat and sinks into insanity. Lestat collapses Armand\\'s coven, buys Renaud\\'s old theatre, and gives it to Nicolas and Eleni, one of Armand\\'s former acolytes. Nicolas founds the Théàtre des Vampires, while Lestat and Gabrielle leave Paris to explore the world. Unhappy with life as a vampire, Nicolas immolates himself in a bonfire, leaving Lestat scarred with his insanity and death.\\nAnother fledgling and long-term companion is Louis de Pointe du Lac. Louis is from a family who emigrated from France to North America when he was very young, he is described as young beautiful man like an angel with \"fine black hair\" and deep green eyes, whom Lestat turns into a vampire in 1791. For many years, Lestat and Louis live, travel, and kill together. Though Louis claims that Lestat made him into a vampire because Lestat merely wanted his fortune, Lestat refutes these claims in the following novel. He points out that he was heir to a vast fortune well before meeting him, and says that he \"fell fatally in love with Louis\", who reminded him of Nicki.\\nLestat and Louis \"adopt\" a dying orphan named Claudia in 1795. Lestat turns her into a vampire in order to tie Louis to him. While Lestat spoils Claudia and tries to teach her how to behave like a vampire, she largely ignores him and  reserves her love for Louis. In 1860, after 65 years of living together, Claudia rebels and tries to kill Lestat by giving him two dead boys poisoned with absinthe and laudanum, then cutting his throat and stabbing him in the chest. With Louis\\'s help, she dumps him in a swamp near the Mississippi River. After Lestat comes back and assaults them with the help of a young composer he has transformed into a vampire, Louis flees with Claudia. In desperation, they burn down their French Quarter house while Lestat is still inside.\\nLouis and Claudia flee to Europe. Lestat follows them, and encounters them at the Théâtre des Vampires. Claudia dies from sun exposure while Louis is held captive by Armand and his followers. Armand leaves with Louis, finally feeling that he has had his revenge on Lestat for ruining his coven.\\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Louis once again discovers Lestat living in New Orleans in a weakened state. Louis turns his back on him in pity and disgust. This version of events, however, is also refuted by Lestat, who made no mention of contact with Louis in that era, though he had been visited by Armand and freely admits that his memory of this period is fragmented. Louis and Lestat reunite in the 1980s with a new understanding, only to be caught up and briefly separated again in the events that are detailed in The Queen of the Damned, though in later books Lestat refers to Louis as his lover.\\nLestat has a disdain for rules and order, and states, in The Queen of the Damned, that he has always had to be his own teacher. He openly disregards and refuses to show fear to Armand, the leader of the Paris coven, even when confronted with the possibility of execution. The only immortal Lestat appears to openly respect and defer to is Marius. Lestat seeks him out as a mentor in the late 18th century, leaving him messages across Europe and Asia until Marius decides to reveal himself. While Lestat eagerly learns from Marius, he also openly breaches many of the rules Marius seeks to impress upon him, such as the prohibition on revealing himself to mortals. Such behavior inspires Marius to refer to Lestat as \"the damnedest creature\" and nickname him \"the Brat Prince.\" Lestat sought Marius out to be his teacher but the relationship turned out also to be a father-son relationship.\\nLestat is entirely responsible for the epic triumph and tragedy told in The Queen of the Damned, after he presents himself to the world through his autobiography and formation of a rock band, singing vampire secrets. His songs waken Akasha, the Queen of the Damned, from her sleep, and she takes Lestat on as her lover while she enacts a horrible plan to take over the world. This adventure forces Lestat to think of things and people other than himself for one of the first times in his long life, and the adventure changes him forever, forcing him to begin fighting for a kind of redemption—though, as displayed in The Tale of the Body Thief, Lestat remains his old, devilish self, revelling in his identity as the Brat Prince.\\nAfter the mysterious and mystical events of Memnoch the Devil, Lestat falls into a vampiric sleep from which the Mayfair witch Merrick eventually manages to wake him, forging a bond between them. After the spiritual, emotional and mystical changes within Lestat during his adventures in the heavenly and hellish realms he visited, Lestat became a legend amongst the remaining vampires, taking control of New Orleans and killing any fledgling vampires who killed mortals in his city. While it is largely due to his actions that the Talamasca—an order of scholars who study the supernatural world but vow to never interfere in it—declare a kind of war on vampires, it is also due to his efforts that no lives are taken over the course of the dispute between the two groups.\\nLestat is sought out by a desperate Tarquin Blackwood in the novel Blackwood Farm to help him with a problem the young vampire feels only the legendary Lestat can help him with. Though Lestat suffers losses from this adventure, he falls somewhat in love with Quinn, and the two stay close after their adventure together reaches its conclusion.\\nIn Blood Canticle, the final novel of both The Vampire Chronicles and The Lives of the Mayfair Witches, Lestat falls in love with a witch of the Mayfair clan named Rowan Mayfair, who shares the same feelings towards him. Rowan eventually asks Lestat to turn her into a vampire but, despite their feelings toward one another, he painfully chose not to, because she is a guiding figure in the Mayfair family and he cannot take her away from it or from her faithful and loving husband Michael.\\n\\nAppearances in other media\\nMovies\\nLestat appears as a major character in both motion picture adaptations of The Vampire Chronicles novels. \\n\\nIn Neil Jordan\\'s 1994 film adaptation of Interview with the Vampire, he is portrayed by Tom Cruise.\\nIn the 2002 film adaptation of Queen of the Damned, he is played by Stuart Townsend.\\n\\nTheatre\\nOn stage, Lestat was portrayed by Hugh Panaro in the short-lived Broadway show Lestat: The Musical composed by Elton John and Bernie Taupin with Drew Sarich, who was playing Armand, as the understudy.\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nLestat became the name and focus of a gothic rock band in Cleveland, Ohio, signed by Jevan Records who split up in 1999. Lestat has since reformed in 2010.Monster Prom features Liam de Lioncourt, one of the six main love interests in this visual novel video game. He is described as \"...a hipster vampire whose stand-offish demeanor hid that he was truly a lovable dork.\" Liam\\'s character was written by Julián Quijano, Cory O’Brien and Maggie Herskowitz and illustrated by Arthur Tien.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website of Anne Rice',\n",
              " 'Lions for Lambs': 'Lions for Lambs is a 2007 American war drama film directed by Robert Redford about the connection between a platoon of United States soldiers in Afghanistan, a U.S. senator, a reporter, and a Californian college professor. It stars Redford, Tom Cruise, and Meryl Streep. It was the first Cruise/Wagner Productions film since the company joined with United Artists subsequent to Cruise\\'s falling out with Paramount Pictures in 2006.With a title that alludes to incompetent leaders sending brave soldiers into the slaughter of battle, the film takes aim at the U.S. government\\'s prosecution of the wars in the Middle East, showing three different simultaneous stories: a senator who launches a new military strategy and details it to a journalist, two soldiers involved in said operation, and their college professor trying to re-engage a promising student by telling him their story. The film was written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, and directed by Robert Redford. It was released in North America on November 9, 2007, to negative reviews and disappointing box office receipts.\\n\\nPlot\\nTwo students at a West Coast university, Arian and Ernest, at the urging of their idealistic professor, Dr. Malley, attempt to do something important with their lives. They make the bold decision to commission in the army to fight in Afghanistan after graduating from college.\\nDr. Malley also attempts to reach talented and privileged, but disaffected, student Todd Hayes, who is not at all like Arian and Ernest. He is naturally bright, comes from a privileged background, but has apparently slipped into apathy upon being disillusioned at the present state of affairs. Now, he devotes most of his time to extra-curricular activities like his role as president of his fraternity. Malley tests him by offering a choice between a respectable grade of \\'B\\' in the class with no additional work required or a final opportunity to re-engage with the material of the class and \"do something.\" Before Todd makes his choice, he must listen to Dr. Malley\\'s story of his former students Arian and Ernest and why they are in Afghanistan.\\nMeanwhile, in Washington, D.C., a charismatic Republican presidential hopeful, Senator Jasper Irving, has invited liberal TV journalist Janine Roth to his office to announce a new war strategy in Afghanistan: the use of small units to seize strategic positions in the mountains before the Taliban can occupy them. The senator hopes that Roth\\'s positive coverage will help convince the public that the plan is sound.\\nRoth has her doubts and fears she is being asked to become an instrument of government propaganda. She informs her commercially-minded boss of her plans to call out the senator\\'s new strategy for what she feels is a ploy, but is shot down. Ultimately, Irving\\'s version of the story is run without the critical interaction.

Ernest falls out, and Arian jumps after him. Ernest\\'s leg is badly wounded, and he suffers a compound fracture, rendering him immobile as the Taliban arrive. After a drawn-out gunfight, the U.S. soldiers run out of ammunition. Rather than getting captured, Arian helps Ernest stand up, facing the enemies and turning their empty weapons against them, an action which prompts the Taliban to kill them. The unit commanders attempt a rescue of the downed soldiers, sending A-10 Warthogs, but the weather, time, and distance interfere.\\nHayes is watching television with a friend.

Col. Falco\\nKevin Dunn as ANX Editor\\n\\nProduction\\nMatthew Michael Carnahan was inspired to write the script when, while channel surfing trying to find a USC Trojans football game, he saw a news report about a Humvee that had flipped into an Iraqi river, drowning about five U.S. soldiers. Carnahan considered it an awful way to die, and \"couldn\\'t get past it fast enough\", considering he was too indifferent, \"talking so much and not doing a damn thing\", and \"the same hypocrite that I so can\\'t stand in our country, the kind of people that will flip right past the news to get to Access Hollywood\". He first considered turning it into a stage play, but the military scenes, in particular the helicopter ones, made him turn it into a film screenplay. The character of Todd Hayes was inspired by Carnahan himself during college.When Robert Redford read the script, he became very interested, considering it smart as opposed to Hollywood\\'s many \"straight-out entertainment\" projects, and also tricky due to the three stories \"that seem to be disparate but are connected and have to come together in a vortex at the end\", and that needed to be represented in a way the movie \"wouldn\\'t be categorized as a lefty film\". Redford considered that the movie\\'s focus was for audiences \"to be entertained in a way that made them think.\"An Irish newspaper claimed that \"The name of the film is derived from a remark made by a German officer during World War I, comparing British soldiers\\' bravery with the calculated criminality of their commanders\".  While several reviewers in the UK have criticized the film for misquoting the commonly used phrase of \"lions led by donkeys\", in an article written for The Times on the origin of the title, Brian Dimuccio and Dino Vindeni claimed that:\\n\\nOne such composition included the observation, \\'Nowhere have I seen such Lions led by such Lambs.\\' While the exact provenance of this quotation has been lost to history, most experts agree it was written during the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest clashes in modern warfare. While some military archivists credit the author as an anonymous infantryman, others argue that the source was none other than General Max von Gallwitz, Supreme Commander  [sic] of the German forces. In either case, it is generally accepted to be a derivation of Alexander the Great\\'s proclamation, \\'I am never afraid of an army of Lions led into battle by a Lamb. I fear more the army of Lambs who have a Lion to lead them.\\'\\nThough Lions for Lambs was the first United Artists venture since Cruise and Paula Wagner attained control, executives billed the film as a \"Robert Redford vehicle.\" Filming began on January 29, 2007, and Redford considered the movie \"the tightest schedule I\\'ve ever worked with,\" with barely a year between announcement and release.\\n\\nPromotion\\nLions for Lambs is the first film under Cruise\\'s and Wagner\\'s new venture with film studio United Artists.  MSNBC reported that Cruise was worried about how the film would perform, because of how the film industry would view him based on its success or failure at the box office.\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nLions for Lambs holds a 27% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 185 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.80/10. The site\\'s consensus states: \"Despite its powerhouse cast, Lions for Lambs feels like a disjointed series of lectures, rather than a sharp narrative, and ends up falling flat.\" On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 47 out of 100, based on 36 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C on scale of A to F.Film critic Roger Ebert gave it two and a half stars, noting that at the beginning of the film the viewer is \"under the delusion that it\\'s going somewhere.\" As the film progresses, Ebert wrote that interest is lost, noting, \"When we begin to suspect it\\'s going in circles, our interest flags.\" Matt Pais of the Chicago Tribune also gave the film two and a half stars, and wrote in summation: \"Redford and Streep give it their all, but Cruise is Cruise, and the go-nowhere \\'Lions\\' is more of an imitation of life than a reflection on it.\" A USA Today review gave the film two and a half stars as well, in a negative review titled: \"As entertainment, \\'Lions\\' whimpers rather than roars.\"  Reviewer Claudia Puig commented, \"Though characters make some strong points, the film feels preachy and falls flat as entertainment.\" The New York Post gave the film one and a half stars, and did not recommend it, writing: \"if you want to be bored by pompous-assery, \\'Meet the Press\\' is free.\"  The Guardian was more critical, giving the film only one star, and calling it \"a muddled and pompous film about America\\'s war on terror.\"Derek Elley of Variety wrote that though the film was \"star-heavy\", it felt like \"the movie equivalent of an Off Broadway play,\" and \"uses a lot of words to say nothing new.\"  The New York Times also mentioned the amount of dialogue in the film, writing: \"It\\'s a long conversation, more soporific than Socratic, and brimming with parental chiding, generational conflict and invocations of Vietnam,\" and the Los Angeles Times described the lecturing in the film as \"dull and self-satisfied.\"  The subtitle of the review in the Los Angeles Times was: \"As a matter of policy, \\'Lions for Lambs\\' doesn\\'t play.\"  In a review entitled \"Political drama feels more like a lecture\" in The Boston Globe, Wesley Morris wrote: \"It does not feel good to report that a movie with Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise makes the eyelids droop. But that\\'s what \\'Lions for Lambs\\' does.\"  Writing in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, reviewer William Arnold wrote positively of the segments of the film involving Robert Redford\\'s character: \"His character, who hopes to save America one slacker at a time, rings true; and his real-life conviction and his fears for democracy come through.\" Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle highlighted Redford\\'s direction of the film, commenting that it was not his best film, but it was \"his bravest.\"  Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described Lions for Lambs as \"a well-made movie that offers no answers but raises many important questions.\"\\n\\nBox office\\nThe film took in USD6.7 million in its opening weekend and debuted at the number four spot. This was one of Cruise\\'s worst wide opener box office takes since The Color of Money, and Catherine Elsworth of The Daily Telegraph wrote that this result \"puts it on course to be Cruise\\'s lowest-grossing movie of all time.\" The film also opened poorly in Europe, with Variety reporting: \"Savage reviews dealt the talky political drama a big blow.\"  In the United Kingdom, Lions for Lambs took in $1.4 million and opened in sixth place.  The film debuted at the number six spot in Germany, and number five in Brazil.  Overall, the film pulled in a total of $10.3 million in markets in its opening weekend outside the United States, and Reuters noted \"Tom Cruise\\'s \\'Lambs\\' got slaughtered at the worldwide box office.\"  By January 14, 2008, the film\\'s domestic returns were just under $15 million.MSNBC reported that Cruise was concerned about the opening weekend results, and quoted a source: \"Tom wanted to really hit a home run with his first United Artists movie. It was more about how the industry was going to view him than the movie going public that Tom was worried about.\"  In response to the opening weekend results, a representative at United Artists stated: \"We performed right at the pre-weekend predictions and are glad to have done that. Given the modest production and marketing budgets we do not need to be a blockbuster hit. Everyone at United Artists are very proud of the film and could not have had a more perfect filmmaker to have made our first film.\"International experts said that the film did not attract its core audience, and that the box office results were due to a failure of the film to cross over to the general public. On November 28, 2007, The Wall Street Journal reported that \"Lions for Lambs has performed so poorly that it may not make back its $35 million investment.\" On December 3, 2007, the New York Post reported that the film was \"assessed to blow as much as $25 mil\", and a report in Variety made the same assessment. Multiple sources have referred to the film as a \"box office bomb\", including the San Francisco Chronicle, U.S. News & World Report, Orlando Sentinel, the New York Post, and New York magazine. New York magazine called the film \"a critical flop and a box-office bomb\", and a report by NewsMax Media characterized it among \"miserable box-office flops\". An article in The Daily Telegraph discussed the film among a \"slew of new movies\" that \"have flopped at the box office\".  The Associated Press called the film a \"box-office clunker\". The film ultimately grossed $63 million worldwide, which included $15 million for its domestic gross and $48 million internationally.\\n\\nSee also\\nLions led by donkeys\\nWar on Terrorism\\nOperation Red Wings\\nBattle of Takur Ghar\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website\\nLions for Lambs at TomCruise.com\\nLions for Lambs at IMDb\\nLions for Lambs at AllMovie',\n",

              " 'Los Angeles Times': 'The Los Angeles Times (sometimes abbreviated as LA Times) is a daily newspaper based in El Segundo, California, which has been published in Los Angeles, California, since 1881. It has the fifth-largest circulation in the U.S., and is the largest American newspaper not headquartered on the East Coast. The paper focuses its coverage of issues particularly salient to the West Coast, such as immigration trends and natural disasters. It has won more than 40 Pulitzer Prizes for its coverage of these and other issues. As of June 18, 2018, ownership of the paper is controlled by Patrick Soon-Shiong, and the executive editor is Norman Pearlstine.In the 19th century, the paper developed a reputation for civic boosterism and opposition to labor unions, the latter of which led to the bombing of its headquarters in 1910. The paper\\'s profile grew substantially in the 1960s under publisher Otis Chandler, who adopted a more national focus. In recent decades the paper\\'s readership has declined, and it has been beset by a series of ownership changes, staff reductions, and other controversies. In January 2018, the paper\\'s staff voted to unionize and finalized their first union contract on October 16, 2019. The paper moved out of its historic downtown headquarters to a facility in El Segundo, California near Los Angeles International Airport in July 2018.\\n\\nHistory\\nOtis era\\nThe Times was first published on December 4, 1881, as the Los Angeles Daily Times under the direction of Nathan Cole Jr. and Thomas Gardiner. It was first printed at the Mirror printing plant, owned by Jesse Yarnell and T.J. Caystile. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the Times continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara to become the paper\\'s editor. Otis made the Times a financial success.\\nHistorian Kevin Starr wrote that Otis was a businessman \"capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment\". Otis\\'s editorial policy was based on civic boosterism, extolling the virtues of Los Angeles and promoting its growth. Toward those ends, the paper supported efforts to expand the city\\'s water supply by acquiring the rights to the water supply of the distant Owens Valley.\\n\\nThe efforts of the Times to fight local unions led to the bombing of its headquarters on October 1, 1910, killing twenty-one people. Two union leaders, James and Joseph McNamara, were charged. The American Federation of Labor hired noted trial attorney Clarence Darrow to represent the brothers, who eventually pleaded guilty.\\nOtis fastened a bronze eagle on top of a high frieze of the new Times headquarters building designed by Gordon Kaufmann, proclaiming anew the credo written by his wife, Eliza: \"Stand Fast, Stand Firm, Stand Sure, Stand True\".\\n\\nChandler era\\nAfter Otis\\'s death in 1917, his son-in-law, Harry Chandler, took control as publisher of the Times. Harry Chandler was succeeded in 1944 by his son, Norman Chandler, who ran the paper during the rapid growth of post-war Los Angeles. Norman\\'s wife, Dorothy Buffum Chandler, became active in civic affairs and led the effort to build the Los Angeles Music Center, whose main concert hall was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in her honor. Family members are buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery near Paramount Studios. The site also includes a memorial to the Times Building bombing victims.\\nIn 1935, the newspaper moved to a new, landmark Art Deco building, the Los Angeles Times Building, to which the newspaper would add other facilities until taking up the entire city block between Spring, Broadway, First and Second streets, which came to be known as Times Mirror Square and would house the paper until 2018. Harry Chandler, then the president and general manager of Times-Mirror Co., declared the Los Angeles Times Building a \"monument to the progress of our city and Southern California\".The fourth generation of family publishers, Otis Chandler, held that position from 1960 to 1980. Otis Chandler sought legitimacy and recognition for his family\\'s paper, often forgotten in the power centers of the Northeastern United States due to its geographic and cultural distance. He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation\\'s most respected newspapers, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. Believing that the newsroom was \"the heartbeat of the business\", Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting. In 1962, the paper joined with The Washington Post to form the Los Angeles Times–Washington Post News Service to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations. He also toned down the unyielding conservatism that had characterized the paper over the years, adopting a much more centrist editorial stance.\\nDuring the 1960s, the paper won four Pulitzer Prizes, more than its previous nine decades combined.\\nWriting in 2013 about the pattern of newspaper ownership by founding families, Times reporter Michael Hiltzik said that:\\n\\nThe first generations bought or founded their local paper for profits and also social and political influence (which often brought more profits). Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers. Under their pressure the companies went public, or split apart, or disappeared. That\\'s the pattern followed over more than a century by the Los Angeles Times under the Chandler family.\\nThe paper\\'s early history and subsequent transformation was chronicled in an unauthorized history, Thinking Big (1977, ISBN 0-399-11766-0), and was one of four organizations profiled by David Halberstam in The Powers That Be (1979, ISBN 0-394-50381-3; 2000 reprint ISBN 0-252-06941-2). It has also been the whole or partial subject of nearly thirty dissertations in communications or social science in the past four decades.\\n\\nFormer Times buildings\\n1881-1886, Temple and New High streets in the Los Angeles central business district\\n1886-1910, northeast corner First and Broadway, Los Angeles central business district, destroyed in a bombing in 1910\\n1912-1935, northeast corner First and Broadway, rebuilt as a four-story building with \"castle-like\" clock tower, opened 1912\\n1935-2018, Times Mirror Square, the block bounded by First, Second, Spring streets and Broadway, Downtown Los Angeles\\n2018-present, El Segundo, California\\n\\nModern era\\nThe Los Angeles Times was beset in the first decade of the 21st century by a change in ownership, a bankruptcy, a rapid succession of editors, reductions in staff, decreases in paid circulation, the need to increase its Web presence, and a series of controversies.\\nFor two days in 2005, the Times experimented with Wikitorial, the first Wiki by a major news organization to allow readers to combine forces to produce their own editorial pieces. It was shut down after being besieged with inappropriate material.The newspaper moved to a new headquarters building in El Segundo, near Los Angeles International Airport, in July 2018.\\n\\nOwnership\\nIn 2000, the Times-Mirror Company, publisher of the Times, was purchased by the Tribune Company of Chicago, Illinois, placing the paper in co-ownership with the then WB-affiliated (now CW-affiliated) KTLA, which Tribune acquired in 1985.On April 2, 2007, the Tribune Company announced its acceptance of real estate entrepreneur Sam Zell\\'s offer to buy the Chicago Tribune,  the Los Angeles Times, and all other company assets. Zell announced that he would sell the Chicago Cubs baseball club. He put up for sale the company\\'s 25 percent interest in Comcast SportsNet Chicago. Until shareholder approval was received, Los Angeles billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad had the right to submit a higher bid, in which case Zell would have received a $25 million buyout fee.In December 2008, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was a result of declining advertising revenue and a debt load of $12.9 billion, much of it incurred when the paper was taken private by Zell.On February 7, 2018, Tribune Publishing (formerly Tronc Inc.), agreed to sell the Los Angeles Times along with other southern California properties (The San Diego Union-Tribune, Hoy) to billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong. This purchase by Soon-Shiong through his Nant Capital investment fund was for $500 million, as well as the assumption of $90 million in pension liabilities. The sale to Soon-Shiong closed on June 16, 2018.\\n\\nEditorial changes and staff reductions\\nJohn Carroll, former editor of the Baltimore Sun, was brought in to restore the luster of the newspaper. During his reign at the Times, he eliminated more than 200 jobs, but despite an operating profit margin of 20 percent, the Tribune executives were unsatisfied with returns, and by 2005 Carroll had left the newspaper. His successor, Dean Baquet, refused to impose the additional cutbacks mandated by the Tribune Company.\\nBaquet was the first African-American to hold this type of editorial position at a top-tier daily. During Baquet and Carroll\\'s time at the paper, it won 13 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other paper except The New York Times. However, Baquet was removed from the editorship for not meeting the demands of the Tribune Group—as was publisher Jeffrey Johnson—and was replaced by James O\\'Shea of the Chicago Tribune. O\\'Shea himself left in January 2008 after a budget dispute with publisher David Hiller.\\nThe paper\\'s content and design style were overhauled several times in attempts to increase circulation. In 2000, a major change reorganized the news sections (related news was put closer together) and changed the \"Local\" section to the \"California\" section with more extensive coverage. Another major change in 2005 saw the Sunday \"Opinion\" section retitled the Sunday \"Current\" section, with a radical change in its presentation and featured columnists. There were regular cross-promotions with Tribune-owned television station KTLA to bring evening-news viewers into the Times fold.\\nThe paper reported on July 3, 2008, that it planned to cut 250 jobs by Labor Day and reduce the number of published pages by 15 percent. That included about 17 percent of the news staff, as part of the newly private media company\\'s mandate to reduce costs. \"We\\'ve tried to get ahead of all the change that\\'s occurring in the business and get to an organization and size that will be sustainable\", Hiller said. In January 2009, the Times eliminated the separate California/Metro section, folding it into the front section of the newspaper. The Times also announced seventy job cuts in news and editorial or a 10 percent cut in payroll.In September 2015, Austin Beutner, the publisher and chief executive, was replaced by Timothy E. Ryan. On October 5, 2015, the Poynter Institute reported that \"\\'At least 50\\' editorial positions will be culled from the Los Angeles Times\" through a buyout. On this subject, the Los Angeles Times reported with foresight: \"For the \\'funemployed,\\' unemployment is welcome.\" Nancy Cleeland, who took O\\'Shea\\'s buyout offer, did so because of \"frustration with the paper\\'s coverage of working people and organized labor\" (the beat that earned her Pulitzer). She speculated that the paper\\'s revenue shortfall could be reversed by expanding coverage of economic justice topics, which she believed were increasingly relevant to Southern California; she cited the paper\\'s attempted hiring of a \"celebrity justice reporter\" as an example of the wrong approach.On August 21, 2017, Ross Levinsohn, then aged 54, was named publisher and CEO, replacing Davan Maharaj, who had been both publisher and editor. On June 16, 2018, the same day the sale to Patrick Soon-Shiong closed, Norman Pearlstine was named executive editor.\\n\\nUnionization\\nOn January 19, 2018, employees of the news department voted 248–44 in a National Labor Relations Board election to be represented by the NewsGuild-CWA. The vote came despite aggressive opposition from the paper\\'s management team, reversing more than a century of anti-union sentiment at one of the biggest newspapers in the country.\\n\\nCirculation\\nThe Times has suffered continued decline in distribution. Reasons offered for the circulation drop included a price increase and a rise in the proportion of readers preferring to read the online version instead of the print version. Editor Jim O\\'Shea, in an internal memo announcing a May 2007, mostly voluntary, reduction in force, characterized the decrease in circulation as an \"industry-wide problem\" which the paper had to counter by \"growing rapidly on-line\", \"break[ing] news on the Web and explain[ing] and analyz[ing] it in our newspaper.\"\\nThe Times closed its San Fernando Valley printing plant in early 2006, leaving press operations to the Olympic plant and to Orange County. Also that year the paper announced its circulation had fallen to 851,532, down 5.4 percent from 2005. The Times\\'s loss of circulation was the largest of the top ten newspapers in the U.S. Some observers believed that the drop was due to the retirement of circulation director Bert Tiffany. Still, others thought the decline was a side effect of a succession of short-lived editors who were appointed by publisher Mark Willes after publisher Otis Chandler relinquished day-to-day control in 1995. Willes, the former president of General Mills, was criticized for his lack of understanding of the newspaper business, and was derisively referred to by reporters and editors as The Cereal Killer. \\nThe Times\\'s reported daily circulation in October 2010 was 600,449, down from a peak of 1,225,189 daily and 1,514,096 Sunday in April 1990.Despite the circulation decline, many in the media industry lauded the newspaper\\'s effort to decrease its reliance on \"other-paid\" circulation in favor of building its \"individually paid\" circulation base—which showed a marginal increase in a circulation audit. This distinction reflected the difference between, for example, copies distributed to hotel guests free of charge (other-paid) versus subscriptions and single-copy sales (individually paid).\\n\\nInternet presence and free weeklies\\nIn December 2006, a team of Times reporters delivered management with a critique of the paper\\'s online news efforts known as the Spring Street Project. The report, which condemned the Times as a \"web-stupid\" organization\", was followed by a shakeup in management of the paper\\'s website, www.latimes.com, and a rebuke of print staffers who had assertedly \"treated change as a threat.\"On July 10, 2007, Times launched a local Metromix site targeting live entertainment for young adults. A free weekly tabloid print edition of Metromix Los Angeles followed in February 2008; the publication was the newspaper\\'s first stand-alone print weekly. In 2009, the Times shut down Metromix and replaced it with Brand X, a blog site and free weekly tabloid targeting young, social networking readers. Brand X launched in March 2009; the Brand X tabloid ceased publication in June 2011 and the website was shut down the following month.In May 2018, the Times blocked access to its online edition from most of Europe because of the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation.\\n\\nOther controversies\\nIt was revealed in 1999 that a revenue-sharing arrangement was in place between the Times and Staples Center in the preparation of a 168-page magazine about the opening of the sports arena. The magazine\\'s editors and writers were not informed of the agreement, which breached the Chinese wall that traditionally has separated advertising from journalistic functions at American newspapers. Publisher Mark Willes also had not prevented advertisers from pressuring reporters in other sections of the newspaper to write stories favorable to their point of view.Michael Kinsley was hired as the Opinion and Editorial (op-ed) Editor in April 2004 to help improve the quality of the opinion pieces. His role was controversial, for he forced writers to take a more decisive stance on issues. In 2005, he created a Wikitorial, the first Wiki by a major news organization. Although it failed, readers could combine forces to produce their own editorial pieces. He resigned later that year.\\nThe Times drew fire for a last-minute story before the 2003 California recall election alleging that gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger groped scores of women during his movie career. Columnist Jill Stewart wrote on the American Reporter website that the Times did not do a story on allegations that former Governor Gray Davis had verbally and physically abused women in his office, and that the Schwarzenegger story relied on a number of anonymous sources. Further, she said, four of the six alleged victims were not named. She also said that in the case of the Davis allegations, the Times decided against printing the Davis story because of its reliance on anonymous sources. The American Society of Newspaper Editors said that the Times lost more than 10,000 subscribers because of the negative publicity surrounding the Schwarzenegger article.On November 12, 2005, new op-ed Editor Andrés Martinez announced the dismissal of liberal op-ed columnist Robert Scheer and conservative editorial cartoonist Michael Ramirez.The Times also came under controversy for its decision to drop the weekday edition of the Garfield comic strip in 2005, in favor of a hipper comic strip Brevity, while retaining the Sunday edition. Garfield was dropped altogether shortly thereafter.Following the Republican Party\\'s defeat in the 2006 mid-term elections, an Opinion piece by Joshua Muravchik, a leading neoconservative and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, published on November 19, 2006, was titled \\'Bomb Iran\\'. The article shocked some readers, with its hawkish comments in support of more unilateral action by the United States, this time against Iran.On March 22, 2007, editorial page editor Andrés Martinez resigned following an alleged scandal centering on his girlfriend\\'s professional relationship with a Hollywood producer who had been asked to guest-edit a section in the newspaper. In an open letter written upon leaving the paper, Martinez criticized the publication for allowing the Chinese Wall between the news and editorial departments to be weakened, accusing news staffers of lobbying the opinion desk.\\n\\nIn November 2017, Walt Disney Studios blacklisted the Times from attending press screenings of its films, in retaliation for September 2017 reportage by the paper on Disney\\'s political influence in the Anaheim area. The company considered the coverage to be \"biased and inaccurate\". As a sign of condemnation and solidarity, a number of major publications and writers, including The New York Times,  Boston Globe critic Ty Burr, Washington Post blogger Alyssa Rosenberg, and the websites The A.V. Club and Flavorwire, announced that they would boycott press screenings of future Disney films. The National Society of Film Critics, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, New York Film Critics Circle, and Boston Society of Film Critics jointly announced that Disney\\'s films would be ineligible for their respective year-end awards unless the decision was reversed, condemning the decision as being \"antithetical to the principles of a free press and [setting] a dangerous precedent in a time of already heightened hostility towards journalists\". On November 7, 2017, Disney reversed its decision, stating that the company \"had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at the Los Angeles Times regarding our specific concerns\".\\n\\nPulitzer Prizes\\nThrough 2014 the Times had won 41 Pulitzer Prizes, including four in editorial cartooning, and one each in spot news reporting for the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.\\nThe Los Angeles Times received the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for the newspaper series \"Latinos\".\\nTimes sportswriter Jim Murray won a Pulitzer in 1990.\\nTimes investigative reporters Chuck Philips and Michael Hiltzik won the Pulitzer in 1999 for a year-long series that exposed corruption in the music business.\\nTimes journalist David Willman won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting; the organization cited \"his pioneering expose of seven unsafe prescription drugs that had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and an analysis of the policy reforms that had reduced the agency\\'s effectiveness.\" In 2004, the paper won five prizes, which is the third-most by any paper in one year (behind The New York Times in 2002 (7) and The Washington Post in 2008 (6)).\\nTimes reporters Bettina Boxall and Julie Cart won a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting in 2009 \"for their fresh and painstaking exploration into the cost and effectiveness of attempts to combat the growing menace of wildfires across the western United States.\"\\nIn 2011, Barbara Davidson was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography \"for her intimate story of innocent victims trapped in the city\\'s crossfire of deadly gang violence.\"\\nIn 2016, the Times won the breaking news Pulitzer prize for its coverage of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.\\nIn 2019, three Los Angeles Times reporters - Harriet Ryan, Matt Hamilton and Paul Pringle - won a Pulitzer Prize for their investigation into a gynecologist accused of abusing hundreds of students at the University of Southern California.\\n\\nCompetition and rivalry\\nIn the 19th century, the chief competition to the Times was the Los Angeles Herald, followed by the smaller Los Angeles Tribune. In December 1903, newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst began publishing the Los Angeles Examiner as a direct morning competitor to the Times. In the 20th century, the Los Angeles Express was an afternoon competitor, as was Manchester Boddy\\'s  Los Angeles Daily News, a Democratic newspaper.By the mid-1940s, the Times was the leading newspaper in terms of circulation in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 1948, it launched the Los Angeles Mirror, an afternoon tabloid, to compete with both the Daily News and the merged Herald-Express. In 1954, the Mirror absorbed the Daily News. The combined paper, the Mirror-News, ceased publication in 1962, when the Hearst afternoon Herald-Express and the morning Los Angeles Examiner merged to become the Herald-Examiner. The Herald-Examiner published its last number in 1989. In 2014, the Los Angeles Register, published by Freedom Communications, then-parent company of the Orange County Register was launched as a daily newspaper to compete with the Times. By late September of the same year, the Los Angeles Register was folded.\\n\\nSpecial editions\\nMidwinter and midsummer\\nMidwinter\\nFor 69 years, from 1885 until 1954, the Times issued on New Year\\'s Day a special annual Midwinter Number or Midwinter Edition that extolled the virtues of Southern California. At first, it was called the \"Trade Number,\" and in 1886 it featured a special press run of \"extra scope and proportions\"; that is, \"a twenty-four-page paper, and we hope to make it the finest exponent of this [Southern California] country that ever existed.\" Two years later, the edition had grown to \"forty-eight handsome pages (9x15 inches), [which] stitched for convenience and better preservation,\" was \"equivalent to a 150-page book.\" The last use of the phrase Trade Number was in 1895, when the edition had grown to thirty-six pages split among three separate sections.The Midwinter Number drew acclamations from other newspapers, including this one from The Kansas City Star in 1923:\\n\\nIt is made up of five magazines with a total of 240 pages – the maximum size possible under the postal regulations. It goes into every detail of information about Los Angeles and Southern California that the heart could desire. It is virtually a cyclopedia on the subject. It drips official statistics. In addition, it verifies the statistics with a profusion of illustration. . . . it is a remarkable combination of guidebook and travel magazine.\\nIn 1948 the Midwinter Edition, as it was then called, had grown to \"7 big picture magazines in beautiful rotogravure reproduction.\" The last mention of the Midwinter Edition was in a Times advertisement on January 10, 1954.\\n\\nMidsummer\\nBetween 1891 and 1895, the Times also issued a similar Midsummer Number, the first one with the theme \"The Land and Its Fruits\". Because of its issue date in September, the edition was in 1891 called the Midsummer Harvest Number.\\n\\nZoned editions and subsidiaries\\nIn 1903, the Pacific Wireless Telegraph Company established a radiotelegraph link between the California mainland and Santa Catalina Island. In the summer of that year, the Times made use of this link to establish a local daily paper, based in Avalon, called The Wireless, which featured local news plus excerpts which had been transmitted via Morse code from the parent paper. However, this effort apparently survived for only a little more than one year.In the 1990s, the Times published various editions catering to far-flung areas. Editions included those from the San Fernando Valley, Ventura County, Inland Empire, Orange County, San Diego County & a \"National Edition\" that was distributed to Washington, D.C. and the San Francisco Bay Area. The National Edition was closed in December 2004.\\nSome of these editions were succeeded by Our Times, a group of community supplements included in editions of the regular Los Angeles Metro newspaper.A subsidiary, Times Community Newspapers, publishes the Daily Pilot of Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. From 2011 to 2013, the Times had published the Pasadena Sun. It also had published the Glendale News-Press and Burbank Leader from 1993 to 2020, and the La Cañada Valley Sun from 2005 to 2020.On April 30, 2020, Charlie Plowman, publisher of Outlook Newspapers, announced he would acquire the Glendale News-Press,\\nBurbank Leader and La Cañada Valley Sun from Times Community Newspapers. Plowman acquired the South Pasadena Review and San Marino Tribune\\nin late January 2020 from the Salter family, who owned and operated these two community weeklies.\\n\\nFeatures\\nOne of the Times\\' features was \"Column One\", a feature that appeared daily on the front page to the left-hand side. Established in September 1968, it was a place for the weird and the interesting; in the How Far Can a Piano Fly? (a compilation of Column One stories) introduction, Patt Morrison wrote that the column\\'s purpose was to elicit a \"Gee, that\\'s interesting, I didn\\'t know that\" type of reaction.\\nThe Times also embarked on a number of investigative journalism pieces. A series in December 2004 on the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles led to a Pulitzer Prize and a more thorough coverage of the hospital\\'s troubled history. Lopez wrote a five-part series on the civic and humanitarian disgrace of Los Angeles\\' Skid Row, which became the focus of a 2009 motion picture, The Soloist. It also won 62 awards at the SND awards.\\nFrom 1967 to 1972, the Times produced a Sunday supplement called West magazine. West was recognized for its art design, which was directed by Mike Salisbury (who later became art director of Rolling Stone magazine). From 2000 to 2012, the Times published the Los Angeles Times Magazine, which started as a weekly and then became a monthly supplement. The magazine focused on stories and photos of people, places, style, and other cultural affairs occurring in Los Angeles and its surrounding cities and communities. Since 2014, The California Sunday Magazine has been included in the Sunday L.A. Times edition.\\n\\nPromotion\\nFestival of Books\\nIn 1996, the Times started the annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, in association with the University of California, Los Angeles. It has panel discussions, exhibits, and stages during two days at the end of April each year. In 2011, the Festival of Books was moved to the University of Southern California.\\n\\nBook prizes\\nSince 1980, the Times has awarded annual book prizes. The categories are now biography, current interest, fiction, first fiction, history, mystery/thriller, poetry, science and technology, and young adult fiction. In addition, the Robert Kirsch Award is presented annually to a living author with a substantial connection to the American West whose contribution to American letters deserves special recognition\".\\n\\nBook publishing\\nThe Times Mirror Corporation has also owned a number of book publishers over the years, including New American Library and C.V. Mosby, as well as Harry N. Abrams, Matthew Bender, and Jeppesen.In 1960, Times Mirror of Los Angeles bought the book publisher New American Library, known for publishing affordable paperback reprints of classics and other scholarly works. The NAL continued to operate autonomously from New York and within the Mirror Company. In 1983, Odyssey Partners and Ira J. Hechler bought NAL from the Times Mirror Company for over $50 million.In 1967, Times Mirror acquired C.V. Mosby Company, a professional publisher and merged it over the years with several other professional publishers including Resource Application, Inc., Year Book Medical Publishers, Wolfe Publishing Ltd., PSG Publishing Company, B.C. Decker, Inc., among others. Eventually in 1998 Mosby was sold to Harcourt Brace & Company to form the Elsevier Health Sciences group.\\n\\nBroadcasting activities\\nThe Times-Mirror Company was a founding owner of television station KTTV in Los Angeles, which opened in January 1949. It became that station\\'s sole owner in 1951, after re-acquiring the minority shares it had sold to CBS in 1948. Times-Mirror also purchased a former motion picture studio, Nassour Studios, in Hollywood in 1950, which was then used to consolidate KTTV\\'s operations. Later to be known as Metromedia Square, the studio was sold along with KTTV to Metromedia in 1963.\\nAfter a seven-year hiatus from the medium, the firm reactivated Times-Mirror Broadcasting Company with its 1970 purchase of the Dallas Times Herald and its radio and television stations, KRLD-AM-FM-TV in Dallas. The Federal Communications Commission granted an exemption of its cross-ownership policy and allowed Times-Mirror to retain the newspaper and the television outlet, which was renamed KDFW-TV.\\nTimes-Mirror Broadcasting later acquired KTBC-TV in Austin, Texas in 1973; and in 1980 purchased a group of stations owned by Newhouse Newspapers: WAPI-TV (now WVTM-TV) in Birmingham, Alabama; KTVI in St. Louis; WSYR-TV (now WSTM-TV) in Syracuse, New York and its satellite station WSYE-TV (now WETM-TV) in Elmira, New York; and WTPA-TV (now WHTM-TV) in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  The company also entered the field of cable television, servicing the Phoenix and San Diego areas, amongst others. They were originally titled Times-Mirror Cable, and were later renamed to Dimension Cable Television. Similarly, they also attempted to enter the pay-TV market, with the Spotlight movie network; it wasn\\'t successful and was quickly shut down. The cable systems were sold in the mid-1990s to Cox Communications.\\nTimes-Mirror also pared its station group down, selling off the Syracuse, Elmira and Harrisburg properties in 1986. The remaining four outlets were packaged to a new upstart holding company, Argyle Television, in 1993. These stations were acquired by New World Communications shortly thereafter and became key components in a sweeping shift of network-station affiliations which occurred between 1994 and 1995.\\n\\nStations\\nNotes:\\n\\n1 Co-owned with CBS until 1951 in a joint venture (51% owned by Times-Mirror, 49% owned by CBS);\\n2 Purchased along with KRLD-AM-FM as part of Times-Mirror\\'s acquisition of the Dallas Times Herald. Times-Mirror sold the radio stations to comply with FCC cross-ownership restrictions.\\n\\nEmployees\\nWriters and editors\\nCartoonists\\nPhotographers\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nAinsworth, Edward Maddin (c. 1940).

              " 'Magnolia (film)': 'Magnolia is a 1999 American epic psychological drama film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. The film stars an ensemble cast including Jeremy Blackman, Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ricky Jay, William H. Macy, Alfred Molina, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Jason Robards (in his final film role) and Melora Walters, and is a mosaic of interrelated characters in search of happiness, forgiveness and meaning in the San Fernando Valley.\\nMagnolia received positive reviews, with critics praising its ambition in acting (particularly Cruise), direction, screenplay, and storytelling, as well as its soundtrack, largely consisting of Aimee Mann songs; however, some deemed it overlong and melodramatic. Of the ensemble cast, Cruise was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 72nd Academy Awards, and won the award in that category at the Golden Globes of 2000. The film also won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival.\\n\\nPlot\\nThe narrator recounts three instances of incredible coincidences and suggests that forces greater than chance play important roles in life.\\nPolice officer Jim Kurring investigates a disturbance at a woman\\'s apartment, finding a body in a closet. Dixon, a neighborhood boy, tries to tell him who committed the murder, but Jim is dismissive. Jim goes to the apartment of Claudia Wilson. Claudia\\'s neighbors called the police after she argued with her estranged father, children\\'s game show host Jimmy Gator, and then blasted music while snorting cocaine. Unaware of her addiction, Jim is attracted to her and prolongs the visit. He asks her on a date that night, to which she says yes.\\nJimmy hosts a long-running quiz show called \"What Do Kids Know?\" and is dying of cancer; he has only a few months to live. That night the newest child prodigy on the show, Stanley Spector, takes the lead as the show begins. He is hounded by his father for the prize money and demeaned by the surrounding adults, who refuse to let him use the bathroom during a commercial break. When the show resumes, he wets himself and freezes, humiliated when everyone realizes what happened. As the show continues, an inebriated Jimmy sickens, and he orders the show to go on after he collapses onstage. But after Stanley\\'s father berates him for freezing on-air, Stanley runs away from the studio.\\nDonnie Smith, a former What Do Kids Know? champion, watches the show from a bar. Donnie\\'s parents spent the money he won as a child, and he has just been fired from his job at Solomon Solomon, an electronics store, due to chronic lateness and poor sales. He is obsessed with getting oral surgery, thinking he will land the man of his dreams after he gets braces. He hatches a plan to get back at his boss by stealing the money he needs for his braces.\\nThe show\\'s former producer, Earl Partridge, is also dying of cancer. Earl\\'s trophy wife, Linda, collects his prescriptions for morphine and other drugs while he is cared for by a nurse, Phil Parma. Earl asks Phil to find his estranged son, Frank Mackey, a motivational speaker peddling a pickup artist course to men. Frank is in the midst of an interview with a journalist who reveals that she knows Frank had to take care of his dying mother after Earl abandoned the family. An angry Frank storms out of the interview while Phil tries to get through to him.\\nLinda goes to see Earl\\'s lawyer, begging him to change Earl\\'s will. She admits she married Earl for his money, but now loves him and does not want it. The lawyer suggests she renounce the will and refuse the money, which would go to Frank. Linda rejects his advice and leaves in a rage. Linda berates Phil for seeking out Frank but later apologizes. She then drives to a vacant parking lot and washes down handfuls of prescription medicine with alcohol. Dixon finds Linda in her car, near death, and calls an ambulance after taking money from her purse.\\nBefore his date with Claudia, Jim takes fire during a pursuit and loses his gun. When he meets Claudia, they promise to be honest with each other, so he confesses his ineptitude as a cop and admits he has not been on a date since he was divorced three years earlier. Claudia says he will hate her because of her problems, but Jim assures her that her past does not matter. They kiss, but she runs off.\\nJimmy goes home to his wife, Rose, and confesses that he cheated on her. She asks why Claudia does not talk to him, and Jimmy admits that Claudia believes he molested her. Rose demands to know if it is true, but Jimmy says he cannot remember if he committed the abuse. Upset, Rose tells Jimmy he deserves to die alone and walks out on him.\\nDonnie takes money from the Solomon Solomon safe. As he drives away, he decides to return the money but discovers he cannot get back in as his key broke off in the lock. While climbing a utility pole to get on the roof, he is seen by a passing Jim. Suddenly, frogs begin falling from the sky, with multiple consequences: as Jimmy is about to shoot himself, frogs fall through his skylight, causing him to shoot the television, which sets his house on fire; Rose crashes her car in front of Claudia\\'s apartment, but makes it inside and reconciles with her daughter; Earl is awakened by the sound and sees Frank beside him before dying; Linda\\'s ambulance crashes in front of the emergency room; and Donnie is knocked from the pole, smashes his teeth, and is dragged to safety by Jim.\\nJim counsels Donnie and helps him return the money; his gun also mysteriously falls from the sky. Frank goes to the hospital to be with Linda, who will recover from her attempted suicide. Stanley returns home and tells his father that he needs to be kinder to him, but his father just tells him to go to bed. Jim goes to see Claudia, telling her he wants to make things work between them, and she smiles in reply.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nAnderson started to get ideas for Magnolia during the long editing period of Boogie Nights (1997).  As he got closer to finishing the film, he started writing down material for his new project. After the critical and financial success of Boogie Nights, New Line Cinema, who backed that film, told Anderson that he could do whatever he wanted and the filmmaker realized that, \"I was in a position I will never ever be in again.\" Michael De Luca, then Head of Production at New Line, made the deal for Magnolia, granting Anderson final cut without hearing an idea for the film. Originally, Anderson had wanted to make a film that was \"intimate and small-scale,\" something that he could shoot in 30 days. He had the title of \"Magnolia\" in his head before he wrote the script.As he started writing, the script \"kept blossoming\" and he realized that there were many actors he wanted to write for and then decided to put \"an epic spin on topics that don\\'t necessarily get the epic treatment\". He wanted to \"make the epic, the all-time great San Fernando Valley movie\". Anderson started with lists of images, words and ideas that \"start resolving themselves into sequences and shots and dialogue,\" actors, and music. The first image he had for the film was the smiling face of actress Melora Walters. The next image that came to him was of Philip Baker Hall as her father. Anderson imagined Hall walking up the steps of Walters\\' apartment and having an intense confrontation with her. Anderson also did research on the magnolia tree and discovered a concept that eating the tree\\'s bark helped cure cancer.Before Anderson became a filmmaker, one of the jobs he had was as an assistant for a television game show, Quiz Kid Challenge, an experience he incorporated into the script for Magnolia. He also claimed in interviews that the film is structured somewhat like \"A Day in the Life\" by The Beatles, and \"it kind of builds up, note by note, then drops or recedes, then builds again\". The production designers looked at films with close, tight color palettes, films that were warm and analyzed why they did that and then applied it to Magnolia. They also wanted to evoke the colors of the magnolia flower: greens, browns and off-whites. For the section of the prologue that is set in 1911, Anderson used a hand-cranked Pathé camera that would have been used at the time. Some of the actors were nervous about singing the lyrics to Mann\\'s \"Wise Up\" in the film\\'s climactic scene and so Anderson had Moore do it first and she set the pace and everyone else followed.Anderson and New Line reportedly had intense arguments about how to market Magnolia. He felt that the studio did not do a decent enough job on Boogie Nights and did not like the studio\\'s poster or trailer for Magnolia. Anderson ended up designing his own poster, cut together a trailer himself, wrote the liner notes for the soundtrack album, and pushed to avoid hyping Cruise\\'s presence in the film in favor of the ensemble cast. Even though Anderson ultimately got his way, he realized that he had to \"learn to fight without being a jerk. I was a bit of a baby. At the first moment of conflict, I behaved in a slightly adolescent knee-jerk way. I just screamed.\"Anderson is known for his use of long takes in his films, moving along considerable distances with complex pivoting movements and transitions in actors and background.  Of the long takes in Magnolia, the most notable may be the 2 minutes 15 seconds where character Stanley Spector arrives at the studio for a taping of What Do Kids Know?, the camera seamlessly moving through multiple rooms and hallways, transitioning to follow different characters throughout the take.\\n\\nScreenplay\\nBy the time he started writing the script, Anderson was listening to Aimee Mann\\'s music. Anderson used her two solo albums and some demo tracks from a new album that Mann was working on as a basis and inspiration for the film.In particular, Mann\\'s song \"Deathly\", on her album Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo, inspired the character of Claudia. At one point in the movie, Claudia uses part of the lyric as dialogue in the film (\"Now that I\\'ve met you/Would you object to/Never seeing each other again\").The character of Jim Kurring originated in the summer of 1998 when actor John C. Reilly grew a mustache out of interest and started putting together an unintelligent cop character. He and Anderson did a few parodies of COPS with the director chasing Reilly around the streets with a video camera. Actress Jennifer Jason Leigh made an appearance in one of these videos. Some of Kurring\\'s dialogue came from these sessions. This time around, Reilly wanted to do something different and told Anderson that he was \"always cast as these heavies or these semi-retarded child men. Can\\'t you give me something I can relate to, like falling in love with a girl?\" Anderson also wanted to make Reilly a romantic lead because it was something different that the actor had not done before.For Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anderson wanted him to play a \"really simple, uncomplicated, caring character\". The actor described his character as someone who \"really takes pride in the fact that every day he\\'s dealing with life and death circumstances\". With Julianne Moore in mind, the director wrote a role for her to play a crazed character using many pharmaceuticals. According to the actress, \"Linda doesn\\'t know who she is or what she\\'s feeling and can only try to explain it in the most vulgar terms possible\". For William H. Macy, Anderson felt that the actor was scared of big, emotional parts and wrote for him, \"a big tearful, emotional part\".While convincing Philip Baker Hall to do the film by explaining the significance of the rain of frogs, the actor told him a story about when he was in the mountains of Italy and got caught in bad weather—a mix of rain, snow and tiny frogs. Hall had to pull off the road until the storm passed. According to an interview, Hall said that he based the character of Jimmy Gator on real-life TV personalities such as Bob Barker and Arthur Godfrey. The rain of frogs was inspired by the works of Charles Fort and Anderson claims that he was unaware that it was also a reference in The Bible when he first wrote the sequence. At the time the filmmaker came across the notion of a rain of frogs, he was \"going through a weird, personal time\", and he started to understand \"why people turn to religion in times of trouble, and maybe my form of finding religion was reading about rains of frogs and realizing that makes sense to me somehow\".\\n\\nCasting\\nTom Cruise was a fan of Anderson\\'s previous film, Boogie Nights, and contacted the filmmaker while he was working on Stanley Kubrick\\'s Eyes Wide Shut (1999). Anderson met with Cruise on the set of Kubrick\\'s film and the actor told him to keep him in mind for his next film. After Anderson finished the script, he sent Cruise a copy and the next day, the actor called him. Cruise was interested but nervous about the role. They met with Cruise along with De Luca who helped convince the actor to do the film. Frank T.J. Mackey, the character that Cruise would play in the film, was based in part on an audio-recording done in an engineering class taught by a friend that was given to Anderson. It consisted of two men, \"talking all this trash\" about women and quoting a man named Ross Jeffries, who was teaching a new version of the Eric Weber course, \"How to Pick Up Women,\" but utilizing hypnotism and subliminal language techniques. Anderson transcribed the tape and did a reading with Reilly and Chris Penn. The director then incorporated this dialogue and his research on Jeffries and other self-help gurus into Mackey and his sex seminar. Anderson felt that Cruise was drawn to the role because he had just finished making Eyes Wide Shut, playing a repressed character, and was able to then play a character that was \"outlandish and bigger-than-life\".Anderson wrote the role of Earl Partridge for Jason Robards, but Robards cannot do it due to staph infection. After George C. Scott declined the role, Robards managed to take it. He said of his character, \"It was sort of prophetic that I be asked to play a guy going out in life. It was just so right for me to do this and bring what I know to it\". According to Hall, much of the material with Partridge was based on Anderson watching his father die of cancer.Anderson wanted Burt Reynolds to star in the film after working on Boogie Nights, but Reynolds declined it.\\n\\nMusic and soundtracks\\nAnderson met Aimee Mann in 1996 when he asked her husband, Michael Penn, to write the score and songs for his film, Hard Eight. Mann had songs on soundtracks before but never \"utilized in such an integral way\" she said in an interview. She gave Anderson rough mixes of songs and found that they both wrote about the same kinds of characters. He encouraged her to write songs for the film by sending her a copy of the script.Two songs were written expressly for the film: \"You Do\", which was based on a character later cut from the film, and \"Save Me\", which closes the film; the latter was nominated in the 2000 Academy Awards and Golden Globes and in the 2001 Grammys. Most of the remaining seven Mann songs were demos and works in progress; \"Wise Up\", which is at the center of a sequence in which all of the characters sing the song, was originally written for the 1996 film Jerry Maguire. At the time Mann\\'s record label had refused to release her songs on an album. The song that plays at the opening of the film is Mann\\'s cover of \"One\" by Harry Nilsson. Mann\\'s track \"Momentum\" is used as the loud playing music in Claudia\\'s apartment scene when Officer Jim arrives and was also featured in the trailer for the film.\\nThe soundtrack album, released in December 1999 on Reprise Records, features the Mann songs, as well as a section of Jon Brion\\'s score and tracks by Supertramp and Gabrielle that were used in the film. Reprise released a full score album in March 2000.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nMagnolia initially opened in a limited release on December 17, 1999, in seven theaters grossing $193,604. The film was given a wide release on January 7, 2000, in 1,034 theaters grossing $5.7 million on its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $22.5 million in North America and $26 million in other territories, for a worldwide tally of $48.5 million, against its budget of $37 million.\\n\\nCritical response\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 146 reviews, with an average rating of 7.48/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Magnolia is an ambitious, lengthy work that ultimately succeeds due to interesting stories and excellent ensemble performances.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C–\" on an A+ to F scale.USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"the most imperfect of the year\\'s best movies\". Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film four stars out of four, praising it in both of his reviews from 2000 and 2008. He said in the first review, \"Magnolia is the kind of film I instinctively respond to. Leave logic at the door. Do not expect subdued taste and restraint, but instead a kind of operatic ecstasy\". After rewatching it in 2008, he added the film to his \\'Great Movies\\' list. Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"B+\" rating, praising Cruise\\'s performance: \"It\\'s with Cruise as Frank T.J. Mackey, a slick televangelist of penis power, that the filmmaker scores his biggest success, as the actor exorcises the uptight fastidiousness of Eyes Wide Shut ... Like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, this cautiously packaged movie star is liberated by risky business\". The Independent said that the film was \"limitless. And yet some things do feel incomplete, brushed-upon, tangential. Magnolia does not have the last word on anything. But is superb\". Kenneth Turan, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, praised Tom Cruise\\'s performance: \"Mackey gives Cruise the chance to cut loose by doing amusing riffs on his charismatic superstar image. It\\'s great fun, expertly written and performed, and all the more enjoyable because the self-parody element is unexpected\". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, \"In the case of Magnolia, I think Mr. Anderson has taken us to the water\\'s edge without plunging in. I admire his ambition and his very eloquent camera movements, but if I may garble something Lenin once said one last time, \\'You can\\'t make an omelet without breaking some eggs\\'.\"In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \"But when that group sing-along arrives, Magnolia begins to self-destruct spectacularly. It\\'s astonishing to see a film begin this brilliantly only to torpedo itself in its final hour,\" but went on to say that the film \"was saved from its worst, most reductive ideas by the intimacy of the performances and the deeply felt distress signals given off by the cast\". Philip French, in his review for The Observer, wrote, \"But is the joyless universe he (Anderson) presents any more convincing than the Pollyanna optimism of traditional sitcoms? These lives are somehow too stunted and pathetic to achieve the level of tragedy\". Time magazine\\'s Richard Schickel wrote, \"The result is a hard-striving, convoluted movie, which never quite becomes the smoothly reciprocating engine Anderson (who did Boogie Nights) would like it to be\".In an interview, Ingmar Bergman mentioned Magnolia as an example of the \"strength of American cinema.\" Roger Ebert included the work in his \"Great Movies\" list in November 2008, saying, \"As an act of filmmaking, it draws us in and doesn\\'t let go.\" Total Film magazine placed it at number 4 in their list of 50 Best Movies in Total Film\\'s lifetime. In 2008, it was named the 89th greatest movie of all time by Empire magazine in its issue of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. It received eight votes – five from critics and three from directors – in the British Film Institute\\'s 2012 Sight & Sound polls.Following the film\\'s release, Anderson said: \"I really feel ... That Magnolia is, for better or worse, the best movie I\\'ll ever make.\" Later, however, he came to consider it overlong; when asked in a Reddit AMA what he would tell himself to do if he could go back to when he shot the movie, his response was \"Chill The Fuck Out and Cut Twenty Minutes.\"In August 2019 the Onion The A.V.

Throughout the film, there are references to the Book of Exodus 8:2 \"And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs.\"\\nThe film has an underlying theme of unexplained events, taken from the 1920s and 1930s works of Charles Fort. Fortean author Loren Coleman\\'s 2001 book \"Mysterious America: The Revised Edition\" includes a chapter entitled \"The Teleporting Animals and Magnolia\", addressing the film. The chapter discusses how one of Fort\\'s books is visible on the table in the library and the film\\'s end credit thanking Charles Fort.The only character who seems to be unsurprised by the falling frogs is Stanley. He calmly observes the event, saying, \"This happens. This is something that happens.\" This has led to the speculation that Stanley is a prophet, allegorically akin to Moses, and that the \"slavery\" the film alludes to is the exploitation of children by adults. These \"father issues\" persist throughout the film, as seen in the abuse and neglect of Claudia, Frank, Donnie, Stanley, and Dixon.\\n\\nHome media\\nThe DVD release includes a lengthy behind-the-scenes documentary, That Moment. It uses a fly-on-the-wall approach to cover nearly every aspect of production, from production management and scheduling to music direction to special effects. The behind-the-scenes documentary is an in-depth look into Anderson\\'s motivation and directing style. Pre-production included a screening of the film Network (1976), as well as Ordinary People (1980). Several scenes showed Anderson at odds with the child actors and labor laws that restrict their work time. The character of Dixon has further scenes filmed but, from Anderson\\'s reactions, appear not to be working. These scenes were cut completely and have never been shown on DVD.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nMagnolia at IMDb\\nMagnolia at Box Office Mojo\\nMagnolia at Rotten Tomatoes\\nMagnolia at Metacritic\\nThe Best and Worst of Magnolia’s Multiple Melodramas from The A.V.

              " 'Martin Scorsese': 'Martin Charles Scorsese (, Italian: [skorˈseːze; -eːse]; born November 17, 1942) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. One of the major figures of the New Hollywood era, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and influential directors in film history. Scorsese\\'s body of work explores themes such as Italian-American identity, Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, faith, machismo, nihilism, crime and sectarianism. Many of his films are known for their depiction of violence and the liberal use of profanity. In 1990, he founded The Film Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to film preservation, in 2007 he founded the World Cinema Foundation and in 2017, he introduced the African Film Heritage Project.Scorsese studied at New York University, where he received a bachelor\\'s degree in English literature in 1964, and received a master\\'s degree in fine arts in film from NYU\\'s Tisch School of the Arts in 1968. In 1967 Scorsese\\'s first feature film Who\\'s That Knocking at My Door was released and was accepted into the Chicago Film Festival, where critic Roger Ebert saw it and called it \"a marvelous evocation of American city life, announcing the arrival of an important new director\". Scorsese\\'s mentors included John Cassavetes, whose chatty, improvisational style did much to influence Scorsese\\'s scripts and production work, and who told him to \"make films about what you know\". In 1971 Scorsese moved to Hollywood, where he associated with some of the young directors who defined the decade, including Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, and George Lucas. He directed Boxcar Bertha (1972), a cut-rate Depression-era film for Roger Corman, and Mean Streets (1973), a personal film about faith and redemption shot in Little Italy, starring Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro.\\nHe has established a filmmaking history involving repeat collaborations with actors and film technicians, including nine films made with Robert De Niro. His films with De Niro are the psychological thriller Taxi Driver (1976), the biographical sports drama Raging Bull (1980), the satirical black comedy The King of Comedy (1982), the musical drama New York, New York (1977), the psychological thriller Cape Fear (1991), and the crime films Mean Streets (1973), Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995) and The Irishman (2019). Scorsese has also been noted for his collaborations with actor Leonardo DiCaprio, having directed him in five films: the historical epic Gangs of New York (2002), the Howard Hughes biography The Aviator (2004), the crime thriller The Departed (2006), the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010), and the Wall Street black comedy The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). The Departed won Scorsese an Academy Award for Best Director, and for Best Picture. Scorsese is also known for his long-time collaboration with film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who has edited every Scorsese film beginning with Raging Bull. Scorsese\\'s other film work includes the black comedy After Hours (1985), the romantic drama The Age of Innocence (1993), the children\\'s adventure drama Hugo (2011), and the religious epics The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Kundun (1997) and Silence (2016).\\nScorsese\\'s films have consistently garnered critical acclaim, with nine nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director, Scorsese is the most-nominated living director and is second only to William Wyler\\'s twelve nominations overall. In 2007, Scorsese was presented with the Kennedy Center Honor at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for his influence in American culture, and four of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". He also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003, a British Film Institute Fellowship in 1995, and a BAFTA Fellowship in 2012. Scorsese is also a recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award for his contributions to the cinema, and has won an Academy Award, a Palme d\\'Or, a Cannes Film Festival Award, a Silver Lion, a Grammy Award, three Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, three BAFTA Awards, and two Directors Guild of America Awards. Scorsese is also known for his work in television, including directing the pilot episodes of the HBO series Boardwalk Empire and Vinyl, the latter he also co-created. As a fan of rock music, he has directed several documentaries on the subject after editing Woodstock (1970), including The Last Waltz (1978), No Direction Home (2005), Shine a Light (2008), George Harrison: Living in the Material World (2011), and Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese (2019).\\n\\nEarly life\\nMartin Scorsese was born on November 17, 1942, in the Flushing area of New York City\\'s Queens borough. His family moved to Little Italy in Manhattan before he started school. Both of Scorsese\\'s parents, Charles Scorsese and Catherine Scorsese (born Cappa), worked in New York\\'s Garment District. Charles was a clothes presser and an actor while Catherine was a seamstress and an actress. Both of them were of Italian descent: his paternal grandparents, Francesco Paolo and Teresa Scozzese, emigrated from Polizzi Generosa, while his maternal grandparents, Martino and Domenica Cappa, emigrated from Ciminna, both in the province of Palermo, Sicily. The original surname of the family was Scozzese, later changed to Scorsese because of a transcription error. Scorsese was raised in a predominantly Catholic environment.As a boy, he had asthma and could not play sports or take part in any activities with other children, so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed a passion for cinema. As a teenager in the Bronx, Scorsese frequently rented Powell and Pressburger\\'s The Tales of Hoffmann (1951) from a store that had one copy of the reel. Scorsese was one of only two people who regularly rented it; the other was future film director George A. Romero.Scorsese has cited Sabu and Victor Mature as his favorite actors during his youth. He has also spoken of the influence of the 1947–48 Powell and Pressburger films Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes, whose innovative techniques later impacted his filmmaking. In his documentary titled A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies, Scorsese said that he was enamored of historical epics in his adolescence, and at least two films of the genre, Land of the Pharaohs and El Cid, appear to have had a deep and lasting impact on his cinematic psyche. Scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on Italian neorealism, and commented on how Bicycle Thieves, Rome, Open City and especially Paisà inspired him and influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian roots. In his documentary, Il Mio Viaggio in Italia (My Voyage to Italy), Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of Roberto Rossellini\\'s Paisà, which he first saw on television with his relatives who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, had a significant impact on his life. He acknowledges owing a great debt to the French New Wave and has stated that \"the French New Wave has influenced all filmmakers who have worked since, whether they saw the films or not.\" He has also cited filmmakers including Satyajit Ray, Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Federico Fellini as major influences on his career. He attended the all-boys Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx, graduating in 1960. He had initially desired to become a priest, attending a preparatory seminary but failed after the first year. This gave way to cinema and consequently Scorsese enrolled in NYU\\'s Washington Square College (now known as the College of Arts and Science), where he earned a B.A. in English in 1964. He went on to earn his M.A. from New York University\\'s School of the Arts (now known as the Tisch School of the Arts) in 1968, a year after the school was founded.\\n\\nCareer\\n1960s\\nWhile attending the Tisch School of the Arts, Scorsese made the short films What\\'s a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This? (1963) and It\\'s Not Just You, Murray! (1964). His most famous short of the period is the darkly comic The Big Shave (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America\\'s involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title Viet \\'67. Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by film professor Haig P. Manoogian.In 1967, Scorsese made his first feature-length film, the black and white I Call First, which was later retitled Who\\'s That Knocking at My Door, with his fellow students actor Harvey Keitel and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese\\'s semi-autobiographical J. R. Trilogy, which would have included a later film, Mean Streets. Film critic Roger Ebert saw the film at the 1967 Chicago International Film Festival and in his review praised Scorsese and the film writing, \"I Call First\" brings these two kinds of films together into a work that is absolutely genuine, artistically satisfying and technically comparable to the best films being made anywhere. I have no reservations in describing it as a great moment in American movies.\" Throughout his career, Scorsese has avoided comparing his own films to those of other filmmakers whom he considers to be his contemporaries after 1967 when his own career in films began. The single exception is Kubrick’s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey.\\n\\n1970s\\nScorsese became friends with the influential \"movie brats\" of the 1970s: Brian De Palma, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. It was De Palma who introduced Scorsese to Robert De Niro. During this period, Scorsese worked as the assistant director and one of the editors on the documentary Woodstock (1970) and met actor–director John Cassavetes, who became a close friend and mentor. In 1972, Scorsese made the Depression-era exploiter Boxcar Bertha for B-movie producer Roger Corman, who also helped directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron, and John Sayles launch their careers. It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with very little money or time, preparing the young director well for the challenges to come with Mean Streets. Following the film\\'s release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make, rather than someone else\\'s projects.\\nChampioned by influential film critic Pauline Kael, Mean Streets was a breakthrough for Scorsese, De Niro, and Keitel. By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority of Mean Streets was shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing and a soundtrack with contemporary music. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, Samuel Fuller and early Jean-Luc Godard. In 1974, actress Ellen Burstyn chose Scorsese to direct her in Alice Doesn\\'t Live Here Anymore, for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in the director\\'s early career as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese next came up with Italianamerican, a documentary featuring his parents Charles and Catherine Scorsese.\\nTaxi Driver followed in 1976—Scorsese\\'s dark, urban nightmare of one lonely man\\'s gradual descent into insanity. The film established him as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographer Michael Chapman, whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors, and complex camera movements. The film starred Robert De Niro as the troubled and psychotic Travis Bickle, and co-starred Jodie Foster in a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute, with Harvey Keitel as her pimp. Taxi Driver also marked the start of a series of collaborations between Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader, whose influences included the diary of would-be assassin Arthur Bremer and Pickpocket, a film by the French director Robert Bresson. Writer–director Schrader often returns to Bresson\\'s work in films such as American Gigolo, Light Sleeper, and Scorsese\\'s later Bringing Out the Dead. Already controversial upon its release, Taxi Driver hit the headlines again five years later, when John Hinckley Jr. made an assassination attempt on then-president Ronald Reagan. He subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with Jodie Foster\\'s Taxi Driver character (in the film, De Niro\\'s character, Travis Bickle, makes an assassination attempt on a senator).\\nTaxi Driver won the Palme d\\'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, also receiving four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. The critical and financial success of Taxi Driver encouraged Scorsese to move ahead with his first big-budget project: the highly stylized musical New York, New York. This tribute to Scorsese\\'s home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director\\'s third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with Liza Minnelli. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by Frank Sinatra. Although possessing Scorsese\\'s usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded positively by some critics. Richard Brody in The New Yorker wrote: For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies. Remarkably, his backward-looking tribute to the golden age of musicals and noirish romantic melodramas turned out to be one of his most freewheeling and personal films.\\nIn 1977 he directed the Broadway musical The Act, starring Liza Minnelli. The disappointing reception that New York, New York received drove Scorsese into depression. By this stage the director had  developed a serious cocaine addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded The Last Waltz, documenting the final concert by The Band. It was held at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco on American Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Paul Butterfield, Neil Diamond, Ronnie Wood, and Eric Clapton. However, Scorsese\\'s commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titled American Boy, also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in Taxi Driver. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director\\'s already fragile health. Scorsese helped provide footage for the documentary Elvis on Tour.\\n\\n1980s\\nBy several accounts (Scorsese\\'s included), Robert De Niro saved Scorsese\\'s life when he persuaded him to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film Raging Bull. Writing for The New Yorker in March 2000, Mark Singer summarized Scorsese\\'s condition stating: He (Scorsese) was more than mildly depressed. Drug abuse, and abuse of his body in general, culminated in a terrifying episode of internal bleeding. Robert De Niro came to see him in the hospital and asked, in so many words, whether he wanted to live or die. If you want to live, De Niro proposed, let\\'s make this picture—referring to Raging Bull, an as-told-to book by Jake La Motta, the former world middleweight boxing champion, that De Niro had given him to read years earlier. Convinced that he would never make another movie, he poured his energies into making this violent biopic of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta, calling it a kamikaze method of film-making. The film is widely viewed as a masterpiece and was voted the greatest film of the 1980s by Britain\\'s Sight & Sound magazine. It received eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Robert De Niro and Scorsese\\'s first for Best Director. De Niro won, as did Thelma Schoonmaker for editing, but Best Director went to Robert Redford for Ordinary People. From this work onwards, Scorsese\\'s films are always labeled as \"A Martin Scorsese Picture\" on promotional material. Raging Bull, filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese\\'s style reached its zenith: Taxi Driver and New York, New York had used elements of expressionism to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight). Thematically too, the concerns carried on from Mean Streets and Taxi Driver: insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.\\nAlthough the screenplay for Raging Bull was credited to Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin (who earlier co-wrote Mean Streets), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader\\'s original draft. It was rewritten several times by various writers including Jay Cocks (who went on to co-script later Scorsese films The Age of Innocence and Gangs of New York). The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and Robert De Niro. The American Film Institute chose Raging Bull as the number one American sports film on their list of the top 10 sports films. In 1997, the Institute ranked Raging Bull as the twenty-fourth greatest film of all time on their AFI\\'s 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. In 2007, they ranked Raging Bull as the fourth greatest film of all time on their AFI\\'s 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list.\\nScorsese\\'s next project was his fifth collaboration with Robert De Niro, The King of Comedy (1983). It is a satire on the world of media and celebrity, whose central character is a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act (kidnapping). The film was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had developed previously, often using a static camera and long takes. Here the expressionism of his previous work gave way to moments of almost total surrealism. It still bore many of Scorsese\\'s trademarks, however. The King of Comedy failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release. German director Wim Wenders numbered it among his 15 favorite films. Also, in 1983, Scorsese made a brief cameo appearance in the film Anna Pavlova (also known as A Woman for All Time), originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes, Michael Powell. This led to a more significant acting appearance in Bertrand Tavernier\\'s jazz film Round Midnight. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of Steven Spielberg\\'s Amazing Stories.\\nWith After Hours (1985), for which he won a Best Director Award at Cannes, Scorsese made an esthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost \"underground\" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor (Griffin Dunne) and features cameos by such disparate actors as Teri Garr and Cheech and Chong. Along with the 1987 Michael Jackson music video \"Bad\", in 1986 Scorsese made The Color of Money, a sequel to the much admired Robert Rossen film The Hustler (1961) with Paul Newman, which co-starred Tom Cruise. Although adhering to Scorsese\\'s established style, The Color of Money was the director\\'s first official foray into mainstream film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: The Last Temptation of Christ.\\nIn 1983, Scorsese began work on this long-cherished personal project. The Last Temptation of Christ, based on the 1955 novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis, retold the life of Christ in human rather than divine terms. Barbara Hershey recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming Boxcar Bertha. The film was slated to shoot under the Paramount Pictures banner, but shortly before principal photography was to start, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, Aidan Quinn was cast as Jesus, and Sting was cast as Pontius Pilate. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played by Willem Dafoe and David Bowie respectively.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by Taxi Driver and Raging Bull veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived blasphemy effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation. Most of the controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with Mary Magdalene in a Satan-induced hallucination while on the cross.\\nIn 1986, Scorsese directed the 18 minute short film Bad featuring Michael Jackson and Wesley Snipes (in his film debut). The short also serves as a music video and was shot in the Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets station in Brooklyn over a 6-week period during November and December 1986. The short film\\'s cinematographer was frequent Scorsese collaborator Michael Chapman. The dancing and filmmaking was heavily influenced by the 1961 film West Side Story. Scorsese also noted the influence of his own film Taxi Driver (1976) in Spike Lee\\'s documentary about the 25th anniversary of the short titled, Bad 25 (2012). The short has been praised by critics as one of the most iconic and greatest videos of all time; Jackson\\'s outfit has been cited as an influence on fashion.Looking past the controversy, The Last Temptation of Christ gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese\\'s canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to Barry Levinson for Rain Man). As a separate film project, and along with directors Woody Allen and Francis Ford Coppola in 1989, Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film New York Stories, called \"Life Lessons\". Roger Ebert\\'s gave the film a mixed review, while praising Scorsese\\'s short as \"really successful\".\\n\\n1990s\\nAfter a decade of films considered by critics to be mixed results, some considered Scorsese\\'s gangster epic Goodfellas (1990) his return to directorial form, and his most confident and fully realized film since Raging Bull. De Niro and Joe Pesci offered a virtuoso display of Scorsese\\'s bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released, Roger Ebert, a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named Goodfellas \"the best mob movie ever\". It is ranked No. 1 on Ebert\\'s movie list for 1990, along with those of Gene Siskel and Peter Travers\\', and is widely considered one of the director\\'s greatest achievements. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination but again lost to a first-time director, Kevin Costner (Dances with Wolves). Joe Pesci earned the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Scorsese and the film also won many other awards, including five BAFTA Awards, a Silver Lion and more. The American Film Institute placed Goodfellas at No. 94 on the AFI\\'s 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version, they moved Goodfellas up to No. 92 on the AFI\\'s 100 Years ... 100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and put Goodfellas at No. 2 on their list of the top 10 gangster films (after The Godfather).\\n\\nIn 1990, he released his only short-form documentary: Made in Milan about fashion designer Giorgio Armani. The following year brought Cape Fear, a remake of a cult 1962 movie of the same name and the director\\'s seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from Alfred Hitchcock and Charles Laughton\\'s The Night of the Hunter (1955). Cape Fear received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting misogynistic violence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese\\'s most commercially successful release until The Aviator (2004), and then The Departed (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.39:1.\\nIn 1990, Scorsese acted in a small role as Vincent van Gogh in the film Dreams by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. Scorsese\\'s 1994 cameo appearance in the Robert Redford film Quiz Show is remembered for the telling line: \"You see, the audience didn\\'t tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. They just wanted to watch the money.\" De Fina-Cappa was the production company he formed that same year with producer Barbara De Fina. In the early 1990s, Scorsese also expanded his role as a film producer. He produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (Mad Dog and Glory, Clockers), low-budget independent films (The Grifters, Naked in New York, Grace of My Heart, Search and Destroy, The Hi-Lo Country), and even the foreign film (Con gli occhi chiusi (With Closed Eyes)).\\n\\nThe Age of Innocence (1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon its original release but was a box office bomb, making an overall loss. As noted in Scorsese on Scorsese by editor–interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.\\nScorsese was interested in doing a \"romantic piece\", and he was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton\\'s text. Scorsese wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this end, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that had had an emotional impact on him. In Scorsese on Scorsese, he documents influences from films such as Luchino Visconti\\'s Senso and his Il Gattopardo (The Leopard) as well as Orson Welles\\'s The Magnificent Ambersons and also Roberto Rossellini\\'s La prise de pouvoir par Louis XIV (The Taking of Power by Louis XIV). Although The Age of Innocence was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including  Best Adapted Screenplay for Scorsese), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis, with whom he would work again on Gangs of New York. This was Scorsese\\'s first film to be shot on Super 35 format.\\nCasino (1995), like The Age of Innocence before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to the director\\'s fans who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. Casino was a box office success, and it received generally positive notices from critics. Comparisons were drawn to his earlier film Goodfellas, and Scorsese admitted Casino bore a superficial resemblance to it, but he maintained that the story was significantly larger in scope. Sharon Stone was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance. During the filming, Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.\\nScorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titled A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies, offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career. He said, \"I wouldn\\'t feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries.\" In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D. W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler—filmmakers such as Douglas Sirk, Samuel Fuller, and Vincente Minnelli, who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast. In the preface to this documentary, Scorsese states his commitment to the \"Director\\'s Dilemma\", in which a successful contemporary director must be pragmatic about the realities of getting financing for films of personal esthetic interest by accepting the need of \"making one film for the studio, and (then) making one for oneself.\"\\nIf The Age of Innocence alienated and confused some fans, then Kundun (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, the People\\'s Liberation Army\\'s entry into Tibet, and the Dalai Lama\\'s subsequent exile to India. Not only a departure in subject matter, Kundun saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate tableau of colorful visual images. The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, Buena Vista Pictures, which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting Kundun\\'s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director\\'s reputation. In the long term, however, it appears Kundun has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. Kundun was the Scorsese\\'s second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following The Last Temptation of Christ.\\nBringing Out the Dead (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier Taxi Driver. Like earlier Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recall the films of Robert Bresson. (It is also worth noting that the film\\'s incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of After Hours.) It received generally positive reviews, although not the universal critical acclaim of some of his other films. It stars Nicolas Cage, Ving Rhames, John Goodman, Tom Sizemore, and Patricia Arquette.\\nOn various occasions Scorsese has been asked to present the Honorary Academy Award during the Oscar telecast. In 1998, at the 70th Academy Awards, Scorsese presented the award to film legend Stanley Donen. When accepting the award Donen quipped, \"Marty this is backwards, I should be giving this to you, believe me\".  In 1999, at the 71st Academy Awards, Scorsese and De Niro presented the award to film director Elia Kazan. This would be a controversial pick for the Academy due to Kazan\\'s past history regarding his involvement with the Hollywood Blacklist in the 1950s. Several members of the audience including Nick Nolte and Ed Harris refused to applaud Kazan when he received the award while others such as Warren Beatty, Meryl Streep, Kathy Bates, and Kurt Russell gave him a standing ovation.\\n\\n2000s\\nIn 1999, Scorsese produced a documentary on Italian filmmakers titled Il Mio Viaggio in Italia, also known as My Voyage to Italy. The documentary foreshadowed the director\\'s next project, the epic Gangs of New York (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome\\'s famous Cinecittà film studios. With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, Gangs of New York was Scorsese\\'s biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like The Age of Innocence, it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who became a fixture in later Scorsese films. The production was highly troubled, with many rumors referring to the director\\'s conflict with Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein. Despite denials of artistic compromise, some felt that Gangs of New York was the director\\'s most conventional film, featuring standard film tropes that the director had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely for exposition purposes and explanatory flashbacks.The final cut of the movie ran to 168 minutes, while the director\\'s original cut was over 180 minutes long. Even so, the film received generally positive reviews with the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 75 percent of the reviews for the film they tallied were positive and summarizing the critics writing, \"Though flawed, the sprawling, messy Gangs of New York is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis\\'s electrifying performance.\" The film\\'s central themes are consistent with the director\\'s established concerns: New York, violence as culturally endemic, and subcultural divisions down ethnic lines. Originally filmed for a release in the winter of 2001 (to qualify for Academy Award nominations), Scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of 2002; the studio consequently delayed the film until its release in the Oscar season of late 2002. Gangs of New York earned Scorsese his first Golden Globe for Best Director. In February 2003, Gangs of New York received 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis; however, it did not win in any category.\\nThe following year, Scorsese completed production of The Blues, an expansive seven-part documentary tracing the history of blues music from its African roots to the Mississippi Delta and beyond. Seven film-makers including Wim Wenders, Clint Eastwood, Mike Figgis, and Scorsese himself each contributed a 90-minute film (Scorsese\\'s entry was titled Feel Like Going Home). In the early 2000s, Scorsese produced several films for up-and-coming directors, such as You Can Count on Me (directed by Kenneth Lonergan), Rain (directed by Katherine Lindberg), Lymelife (directed by Derick Martini) and The Young Victoria (directed by Jean-Marc Vallée). At that time, he established Sikelia Productions. In 2003, producer Emma Tillinger Koskoff joined the company. Scorsese also produced several documentaries, such as The Soul of a Man (directed by Wim Wenders) and Lightning in a Bottle (directed by Antoine Fuqua).\\n\\nScorsese\\'s film The Aviator (2004) is a lavish, large-scale biopic of eccentric aviation pioneer and film mogul Howard Hughes and reunited Scorsese with actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The film received highly positive reviews. The film was a widespread box office success and gained Academy recognition. The Aviator was nominated for six Golden Globe awards, including Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Motion Picture Drama for Leonardo DiCaprio. It won three, including Best Motion Picture-Drama and Best Actor-Motion Picture Drama. In January 2005 The Aviator became the most-nominated film of the 77th Academy Awards nominations, nominated in 11 categories including Best Picture. The film also garnered nominations in nearly all the other major categories, including a fifth Best Director nomination for Scorsese. Despite having the most nominations, the film won only five Oscars. Scorsese lost again, this time to director Clint Eastwood for Million Dollar Baby (which also won Best Picture).\\nNo Direction Home is a documentary film by Scorsese that tells of the life of Bob Dylan, and his impact on American popular music and the culture of the 20th century. The film does not cover Dylan\\'s entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then-controversial transformation from an acoustic guitar-based musician and performer to an electric guitar-influenced sound and his \"retirement\" from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident. The film was first presented on television in both the United States (as part of the PBS American Masters series) and the United Kingdom (as part of the BBC Two Arena series) on September 26 to 27, 2005. A DVD version of the film was released the same month. The film won a Peabody Award and the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. In addition, Scorsese received an Emmy nomination for it.\\n\\nScorsese returned to the crime genre with the Boston-set thriller The Departed, based on the Hong Kong police drama Infernal Affairs (which is co-directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak). The film continued Scorsese\\'s collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio and was the first time he worked with Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, and Martin Sheen.\\nThe Departed opened to widespread critical acclaim, with some proclaiming it as one of the best efforts Scorsese had brought to the screen since 1990\\'s Goodfellas, and still others putting it at the same level as Scorsese\\'s most celebrated classics Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. With domestic box office receipts surpassing US$129.4 million, The Departed was Scorsese\\'s highest-grossing film (not accounting for inflation) until 2010\\'s Shutter Island.\\nThe Departed earned Scorsese a second Golden Globe for Best Director, as well as a Critics\\' Choice Award, his first Directors Guild of America Award, and the Academy Award for Best Director. Presented with the latter, Scorsese poked fun at his track record of nominations, asking, \"Could you double-check the envelope?\" The award was presented by his longtime friends and colleagues Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The Departed also received the Academy Award for the Best Motion Picture of 2006, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing by longtime Scorsese editor Thelma Schoonmaker; her latter\\'s win for a Scorsese film.\\nShine a Light captures rock and roll band The Rolling Stones\\' performing at New York City\\'s Beacon Theater on October 29 and November 1, 2006, intercut with brief news and interview footage from throughout their career. The film was initially scheduled for release on September 21, 2007, but Paramount Classics postponed its general release until April 2008. Its world premiere was at the opening of the 58th Berlinale Film Festival on February 7, 2008. \"Marty did an amazing job of making us look great…\" observed drummer Charlie Watts. \"It\\'s all in the edits and the cuts. That\\'s a movie maker rather than a guy just shooting a band onstage… It\\'s not Casablanca, but it\\'s a great thing to have from our point of view, not being egotistical. It\\'s a document.\"In 2009, Scorsese signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, calling for his release from custody after he was detained in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges.\\n\\n2010s\\nOn October 22, 2007, Daily Variety reported that Scorsese would reunite with Leonardo DiCaprio on a fourth picture, Shutter Island. Principal photography on the Laeta Kalogridis screenplay, based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, began in Massachusetts in March 2008. In December 2007, actors Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Ben Kingsley, and Michelle Williams joined the cast, marking the first time these actors had worked with Scorsese. The film was released on February 19, 2010. On May 20, 2010, the film became Scorsese\\'s highest-grossing film. In 2010, The Wall Street Journal reported that Scorsese was supporting the David Lynch Foundation\\'s initiative to help 10,000 military veterans overcome posttraumatic stress disorder through Transcendental Meditation; Scorsese has publicly discussed his own practice of TM.Scorsese directed the series premiere for Boardwalk Empire, an HBO drama series, starring Steve Buscemi and Michael Pitt, based on Nelson Johnson\\'s book Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times and Corruption of Atlantic City. Terence Winter, who wrote for The Sopranos, created the series. In addition to directing the pilot (for which he won the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing), Scorsese also served as an executive producer on the series. The series premiered on September 19, 2010, and was broadcast for five seasons.Scorsese directed the three-and-a-half-hour documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World about the life and music of former Beatles\\' member George Harrison, which premiered in the United States on HBO over two parts on October 5 and 6, 2011. His next film Hugo is a 3D adventure drama film based on Brian Selznick\\'s novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret. The film stars Asa Butterfield, Chloë Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Christopher Lee, and Jude Law. The film has been met with critical acclaim and earned Scorsese his third Golden Globe Award for Best Director. The film was also nominated for 11 Academy Awards, winning five of them and becoming tied with Michel Hazanavicius\\'s film The Artist for the most Academy Awards won by a single film in 2011. Hugo also won two BAFTA awards, among numerous other awards and nominations. Hugo was Scorsese\\'s first 3D film and was released in the United States on November 23, 2011.Scorsese\\'s 2013 film, The Wolf of Wall Street, is an American biographical black comedy based on Jordan Belfort\\'s memoir of the same name. The screenplay was written by Terence Winter and starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, along with Jonah Hill, Matthew McConaughey, and others. The film marked the fifth collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio and the second between Scorsese and Winter after Boardwalk Empire. It was released on December 25, 2013. The film tells the story of a New York stockbroker, played by DiCaprio, who engages in a large securities fraud case involving illicit stock manipulation, by way of the practice of \"pump and dump\". DiCaprio was given the award for Best Actor-Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 2014 Golden Globe Awards. The film was also nominated for Best Motion Picture-Musical or Comedy as well. The Wolf of Wall Street was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Leonardo DiCaprio, Best Supporting Actor for Jonah Hill, Best Director for Martin Scorsese, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Terence Winter but did not win in any category. In a 2016 critics\\' poll conducted by the BBC, the film was ranked among the 100 greatest motion pictures since 2000.Scorsese and David Tedeschi made a documentary about the history of the New York Review of Books, titled The 50 Year Argument. It screened as a work in progress at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2014 and premiered in June 2014 at the Sheffield Doc/Fest. It was also screened in Oslo, and Jerusalem before being shown on the BBC\\'s Arena series in July and at Telluride in August. In September, it was screened at the Toronto and  Calgary International Film Festivals, and the New York Film Festival. It aired on HBO on September 29, 2014.Scorsese directed the pilot for Vinyl written by Terence Winter and George Mastras, with Mick Jagger producing and Mastras as showrunner. The series stars Bobby Cannavale as Richie Finestra, founder and president of a top-tier record label, set in 1970s New York City\\'s drug-and sex-fueled music business as punk and disco were breaking out, all told through the eyes of Finestra trying to resurrect his label and find the next new sound. Filming began on July 25, 2014. Co-stars include Ray Romano, Olivia Wilde, Juno Temple, Andrew Dice Clay, Ato Essandoh, Max Casella, and James Jagger. On December 2, 2014, Vinyl was picked up by HBO. The series lasted one season. Scorsese has acted as executive producer of several indie films, like the 2014 The Third Side of the River (directed by his protege Celina Murga), another 2014 film Revenge of the Green Dragons (co-directed by Andrew Lau, whose film Infernal Affairs inspired The Departed), as well as Bleed for This and Free Fire.Scorsese directed The Audition, a short film that also served as a promotional piece for casinos Studio City in Macau and City of Dreams in Manila, Philippines. The short brought together Scorsese\\'s long-time muses Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro for the first time under his direction. The short film featured the two actors, playing fictionalized versions of themselves, competing for a role in Scorsese\\'s next film. It was Scorsese\\'s first collaboration with De Niro in two decades. The film premiered in October 2015 in conjunction with the grand opening of Studio City.Scorsese had long anticipated filming an adaptation of Shūsaku Endō\\'s novel Silence, a drama about the lives of two Portuguese Jesuit priests in Japan during the 17th century. He had originally planned Silence as his next project following Shutter Island. On April 19, 2013, financing was secured for Silence by Emmett/Furla Films, and filming began in January 2015. By November 2016, the film had completed post-production. It was written by Jay Cocks and Scorsese, based on the novel, and stars Andrew Garfield, Liam Neeson, and Adam Driver. The film was released on December 23, 2016. Scorsese was recognized as an Italian citizen by jus sanguinis in 2018.On January 10, 2019, Variety\\'s Chris Willman reported that Scorsese\\'s long-anticipated documentary of Bob Dylan\\'s 1975 tour, the Rolling Thunder Revue, would be released by Netflix: \"Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese captures the troubled spirit of America in 1975 and the joyous music that Dylan performed during the fall of that year. Part documentary, part concert film, part fever dream, Rolling Thunder is a one of a kind experience, from master filmmaker Martin Scorsese.\" On April 25, 2019, it was announced that the documentary would be released on Netflix on June 12, 2019, with a concurrent theatrical engagement in twenty American, European, and Australian cities the night before, and an extended theatrical schedule in Los Angeles and New York so that the film will qualify for award consideration. After years of development, principal photography on Scorsese\\'s crime film The Irishman began in August 2017, starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino. The film had its world premiere at the 57th New York Film Festival on September 27, 2019. It received a limited theatrical release on November 1, 2019, followed by digital streaming on November 27, 2019, on Netflix. In January 2020, The Irishman received ten Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Pacino and Pesci.\\n\\n2020s\\nOn December 29, 2020, the trailer for Scorsese\\'s documentary series Pretend It\\'s a City was released. The series features Fran Lebowitz and Scorsese as they delve into her personal beliefs and thoughts on New York City. The project was released January 8, 2021 on Netflix. This is Scorsese\\'s second documentary featuring Lebowitz, the first being Public Speaking (2010) which was released on HBO.In July 2019, Scorsese started scouting locations in preparation for the 2020 filming of his next film Killers of the Flower Moon, a film adaptation of the book of the same name by David Grann. Scorsese will be teaming up with Leonardo DiCaprio for the sixth time and Robert De Niro for the tenth time. In December 2019, Scorsese\\'s frequent cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto confirmed that Flower Moon was gearing up to start principal photography in March 2020, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, it was announced that filming for Killers of the Flower Moon had been postponed indefinitely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, that the potential cost of the film had ballooned to $200 million, and that Scorsese was in talks with Netflix or Apple Inc. to produce and distribute, with Paramount Pictures involved as a partner. On May 27, 2020, Apple bought the production and distribution rights to the film, which will be released theatrically by Paramount and streaming on Apple TV+. Principal photography is expected to commence in February 2021.\\n\\nFilmmaking style and technique\\nSeveral recurring filmmaking techniques are identifiable in many of Scorsese\\'s films. He has established a filmmaking history which involves repeat collaborations with actors, screenwriters, film editors, and cinematographers, sometimes extending over several decades, such as that with recurring cinematographers Michael Ballhaus, Robert Richardson, and Rodrigo Prieto.\\n\\nSlow motion and freeze frame\\nScorsese is known for his frequent use of slow motion, for example, in Who\\'s That Knocking at My Door (1967) and Mean Streets (1973). He is also known for using freeze frames, such as: in the opening credits of The King of Comedy (1983), throughout Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), The Departed (2006), and in The Irishman (2019). His blonde leading ladies are usually seen through the eyes of the protagonist as angelic and ethereal; they wear white in their first scene and are photographed in slow motion—Cybill Shepherd in Taxi Driver; Cathy Moriarty\\'s white bikini in Raging Bull; Sharon Stone\\'s white minidress in Casino. This may be a nod to director Alfred Hitchcock. Scorsese often uses long tracking shots, as seen in Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and Hugo. MOS sequences set to popular music or voice-over are regularly seen in his films, often involving aggressive camera movement and/or rapid editing. Scorsese sometimes highlights characters in a scene with an iris, an homage to 1920s silent film cinema (as scenes at the time sometimes used this transition). This effect can be seen in Casino (it is used on Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci), Life Lessons, The Departed (on Matt Damon), and Hugo. Some of his films include references/allusions to Westerns, particularly Rio Bravo, The Great Train Robbery, Shane, The Searchers, and The Oklahoma Kid. Slow motion flashbulbs and accented camera/flash/shutter sounds are often used, as is the song \"Gimme Shelter\" by The Rolling Stones heard in several of Scorsese\\'s films: Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed.\\n\\nCameo appearances\\nScorsese usually has a quick cameo in his films (Who\\'s That Knocking at My Door, Boxcar Bertha, Mean Streets, Alice Doesn\\'t Live Here Anymore, Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, After Hours, The Last Temptation of Christ (albeit hidden under a hood), The Age of Innocence, Gangs of New York, Hugo), he is also known to contribute his voice to a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as in The Aviator and The Wolf of Wall Street). In The Age of Innocence, for example, he appears in the non-speaking role of a large format portrait photographer in one of the passing scenes of the film. He provides the opening voice-over narration in Mean Streets and The Color of Money; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene of Raging Bull, and provides the voice of the unseen ambulance dispatcher in Bringing Out the Dead. He also appears as the director of fictional newly formed Vatican Television in the Italian comedy In the Pope\\'s Eye.\\n\\nReligious guilt\\nGuilt is a prominent theme in many of his films, as is the role of Catholicism in creating and dealing with guilt (Who\\'s That Knocking at My Door, Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Bringing Out the Dead, The Departed, Shutter Island, and The Irishman). In a similar manner, Scorsese considered Silence a \"passion project\": it had been in development since 1990, two years after the release of his film The Last Temptation of Christ, which also contained strongly religious themes. When asked why he retained interest in a project dealing with strong theological themes for over 26 years, Scorsese said,As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there\\'s got to be more ... Silence is just something that I\\'m drawn to in that way. It\\'s been an obsession, it has to be done ... it\\'s a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions.\\n\\nPolitical corruption\\nMore recently, his films have featured corrupt authority figures, such as policemen in The Departed and politicians in Gangs of New York and The Aviator. He is also known for his liberal usage of profanity, dark humor, and violence.\\nScorsese\\'s interest in political corruption as depicted in his films was expanded further in his 2019 film The Irishman. Richard Brody writing for The New Yorker found the main interpretation of the film to be a dark allegory of a realist reading of American politics and American society stating: The real-life Hoffa... (was) a crucial player in both gangland politics and the actual practical politics of the day, and the movie\\'s key through line is the inseparability of those two realms. The Irishman is a sociopolitical horror story that views much of modern American history as a continuous crime in motion, in which every level of society—from domestic life through local business through big business through national and international politics—is poisoned by graft and bribery, shady deals and dirty money, threats of violence and its gruesome enactment, and the hard-baked impunity that keeps the entire system running.\\n\\nFrequent collaborators\\nScorsese often casts the same actors in his films, particularly Robert De Niro, who has collaborated with Scorsese on nine feature films and one short film. Included are the three films (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas) that made AFI\\'s 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. Scorsese has often said he thinks De Niro\\'s best work under his direction was Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy. After the turn of the century, Scorsese found a new muse with younger actor Leonardo DiCaprio, collaborating on five feature films and one short to date. Several critics have compared Scorsese\\'s new partnership with DiCaprio with his previous one with De Niro. Frequent collaborators also include: Victor Argo (6), Harvey Keitel (6), Harry Northup (6), Murray Moston (5), Illeana Douglas (4), J. C. MacKenzie (4), Joe Pesci (4), Frank Vincent (3), Barry Primus (3), and Verna Bloom (3). Others who have appeared in multiple Scorsese films include Daniel Day-Lewis, who had become very reclusive to the Hollywood scene, Alec Baldwin, Willem Dafoe, Ben Kingsley, Jude Law, Dick Miller, Liam Neeson, Emily Mortimer, John C. Reilly, David Carradine, Barbara Hershey, Kevin Corrigan, Jake Hoffman, Frank Sivero, Ray Winstone and Nick Nolte. Before their deaths, Scorsese\\'s parents, Charles Scorsese and Catherine Scorsese, appeared in bit parts, walk-ons or supporting roles, such as in Goodfellas.For his crew, Scorsese frequently worked with editors Marcia Lucas and Thelma Schoonmaker, cinematographers Michael Ballhaus, Robert Richardson, Michael Chapman and Rodrigo Prieto, screenwriters Paul Schrader, Mardik Martin, Jay Cocks, Terrence Winter, John Logan and Steven Zaillian, costume designer Sandy Powell, production designers Dante Ferretti and Bob Shaw, music producer Robbie Robertson, and composers Howard Shore and Elmer Bernstein. Schoonmaker, Richardson, Powell, and Ferretti have each won Academy Awards in their respective categories on collaborations with Scorsese. Elaine and Saul Bass, the latter being Hitchcock\\'s frequent title designer, designed the opening credits for Goodfellas, The Age of Innocence, Casino and Cape Fear.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nIn 1965, Scorsese married his first wife Laraine Marie Brennan, and they remained together for six years between 1965 and 1971; they have a daughter, Catherine, who was named after his mother. Since their divorce in 1972, Scorsese has had four subsequent wives and identifies himself as a lapsed Roman Catholic as a result of the Church\\'s doctrinal position against divorce. He has said, \"I\\'m a lapsed Catholic. But I am Roman Catholic; there\\'s no way out of it.\"In 1976, Scorsese married the writer Julia Cameron, his second marriage; they have a daughter (Domenica Cameron-Scorsese, who is an actress and appeared in The Age of Innocence), but the marriage lasted only a year. The divorce was acrimonious and served as the basis of Cameron\\'s first feature, the dark comedy God\\'s Will, which also starred their daughter. She had a small role in Cape Fear using the name Domenica Scorsese and has continued to act, write, direct, and produce.Before the end of 1979, Scorsese married actress Isabella Rossellini, and they stayed together for four years, divorcing in 1983.Scorsese married producer Barbara De Fina in 1985, his fourth of five marriages; they divorced in 1991. Throughout the early 1990s until 1997, Scorsese was romantically involved with actress Illeana Douglas following his fourth divorce.\\n\\nFilmography\\nAs of 2019, Scorsese has directed 25 full-length films and 16 full-length documentary films.\\n\\nFavorite films\\nIn 2012, Scorsese participated in the Sight & Sound film polls of that year. Held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films of their choice. Scorsese, however, picked 12, which are listed below in alphabetical order:\\n\\nIn 1999, after the death of Gene Siskel, Scorsese joined Roger Ebert as the guest co-host for an episode of Siskel & Ebert where they each stated their 10 favorite films of the decade. Scorsese\\'s list numerically is:\\n\\nFilm activism\\nScorsese has mentioned his mentors being such filmmakers as John Cassavetes, Roger Corman, and Michael Powell. In film critic Roger Ebert\\'s book, Scorsese by Ebert, Ebert praised Scorsese for championing and supporting other filmmakers by serving as an executive producer on projects of filmmakers such as Antoine Fuqua, Wim Wenders, Kenneth Lonergan, Stephen Frears, Allison Anders, Spike Lee, and John McNaughton. More recently he\\'s executive produced the films of the Safdie Brothers, Joanna Hogg, Kornél Mundruczó, Josephine Decker, Danielle Lessovitz, Alice Rohrwacher, Jonas Carpignano, Amélie van Elmbt, and Celina Murga. Scorsese has also chosen to name filmmakers throughout the years that he admires such as fellow New York City-based directors Woody Allen and Spike Lee, as well as other artists such as Wes Anderson, Bong Joon-ho, Greta Gerwig, Ari Aster, Kelly Reichardt, Claire Denis, Noah Baumbach, Paul Thomas Anderson, the Coen Brothers, and Kathryn Bigelow.\\n\\nFilm preservation\\nThe Film Foundation\\nScorsese had been at the forefront in film preservation and restoration ever since 1990, when he created The Film Foundation, a non-profit film organization which collaborates with film studios to restore prints of old or damaged films. Scorsese launched the organization with Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola, Clint Eastwood, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Robert Redford, and Steven Spielberg, who all sat on the foundation\\'s original board of directors. In 2006, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Curtis Hanson, Peter Jackson, Ang Lee and Alexander Payne joined them. In 2015, Christopher Nolan also joined the board. The foundation has restored more than 800 films from around the world and conducts a free educational curriculum for young people on the language and history of film. For his advocacy in film restoration he received the Robert Osborne Award at the 2018 TCM Film Festival. The award was given to Scorsese as \"an individual who has significantly contributed to preserving the cultural heritage of classic films\".In November 2020, the Criterion Channel released a 30-minute video titled, 30 Years of The Film Foundation: Martin Scorsese and Ari Aster in Conversation, celebrating the \"mission, evolution, and ongoing work of The Film Foundation\". Scorsese stated as of 2020, the Foundation has helped restore 850 films.\\n\\nThe World Cinema Project\\nIn 2007, Scorsese established the World Cinema Project with the mission, to preserve and present marginalized and infrequently screened films from regions generally ill-equipped to preserve their own cinema history. Scorsese\\'s organization has worked with the Criterion Collection to not only preserve the films but to allow them to be released on DVD and Blu-ray boxsets and on streaming services such as The Criterion Channel. Films in the WCP include Ousmane Sembène\\'s Black Girl (1966), and Djibril Diop Mambéty\\'s Touki Bouki (1973).\\nThe Criterion Collection so far has released two Vol. boxsets on DVD and Blu-ray, titled, Martin Scorsese\\'s World Cinema Project. The first Volume includes 6 titles, Touki Bouki (1973), Redes (1936), A River Called Titas (1973), Dry Summer (1964), Trances (1981) and The Housemaid (1960).  The second volume also includes 6 titles, Insiang (1976), Mysterious Object at Noon (2000), Revenge (1989), Limite (1931),  Law of the Border (1967), and Taipei Story (1985).\\n\\nThe African Film Heritage Project\\nIn 2017, Scorsese also introduced The African Film Heritage Project (AFHP), which is a joint initiative between Scorsese\\'s non-profit The Film Foundation, UNESCO, Cineteca di Bologna, and the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI). The project aims to locate and preserve 50 classic African films, some thought lost and others beyond repair, with hopes to make them available to audiences everywhere. In an interview with Cinema Escapist in 2018, Scorsese talked about the ambitious collaboration saying, \"Our first goal is to launch and conduct a thorough investigation in film archives and laboratories around the world, in order to locate the best surviving elements—original negatives, we hope—for our first 50 titles.\" He also stated that \"Restoration is always the primary goal, of course, but within the initiative, it’s also a starting point of a process that follows through with exhibition and dissemination in Africa and abroad. And of course, our restoration process always includes the creation of preservation elements.\"In 2019, the AFHP, announced that they would screen restorations of four African films on their home continent for the first time as part of the 50th anniversary of the Pan African Film Festival of Ouagadougou. The movies in question are Med Hondo’s Soleil Ô (1970), Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina’s Chronique des années de braise (1975), Timité Bassori’s La Femme au couteau (1969), and Jean-Pierre Dikongue-Pipa’s Muna Moto (1975).\\n\\nLegacy and honors\\nScorsese\\'s films have been nominated for numerous awards both nationally and internationally, with an Academy Award win for The Departed. In 1991, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1997, Scorsese received the AFI Life Achievement Award. In 1998, the American Film Institute placed three Scorsese films on their list of the greatest American movies: Raging Bull at #24, Taxi Driver at #47, and Goodfellas at #94. For the tenth-anniversary edition of their list, Raging Bull was moved to #4, Taxi Driver was moved to #52, and Goodfellas was moved to #92. In 2001, the American Film Institute placed two Scorsese films on their list of the most \"heart-pounding movies\" in American cinema: Taxi Driver at #22 and Raging Bull at #51. At a ceremony in Paris, France, on January 5, 2005, Martin Scorsese was awarded the French Legion of Honour in recognition of his contribution to cinema. On February 8, 2006, at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, Scorsese was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video for No Direction Home.\\nIn 2007, Scorsese was listed among Time magazine\\'s 100 Most Influential People in The World. In August 2007, Scorsese was named the second-greatest director of all time in a poll by Total Film magazine, in front of Steven Spielberg and behind Alfred Hitchcock. In 2007, Scorsese was honored by the National Italian American Foundation (N.I.A.F.) at the nonprofit\\'s thirty-second Anniversary Gala. During the ceremony, Scorsese helped launch N.I.A.F.\\'s Jack Valenti Institute in memory of former foundation board member and past president of the Motion Picture Association of America (M.P.A.A.) Jack Valenti. The Institute provides support to Italian film students in the U.S. Scorsese received his award from Mary Margaret Valenti, Jack Valenti\\'s widow. Certain pieces of Scorsese\\'s film-related material and personal papers are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives, to which scholars and media experts from around the world may have full access. On September 11, 2007, the Kennedy Center Honors committee, which recognizes career excellence and cultural influence, named Scorsese as one of the honorees for the year. On June 17, 2008, the American Film Institute placed two of Scorsese\\'s films on the AFI\\'s 10 Top 10 list: Raging Bull at number one for the Sports genre and Goodfellas at number two for the Gangster genre. In 2013, the staff of Entertainment Weekly voted Mean Streets the seventh greatest film ever made.\\n\\nOn January 17, 2010, at the 67th Golden Globe Awards, Scorsese was the recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award. On September 18, 2011, at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, Scorsese won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for his work on the series premiere of Boardwalk Empire. In 2011, Scorsese received an honorary doctorate from the National Film School in Lodz. At the awards ceremony he said, \"I feel like I\\'m a part of this school and that I attended it,\" paying tribute to the films of Wajda, Munk, Has, Polanski and Skolimowski. King Missile wrote \"Martin Scorsese\" in his honor. On February 12, 2012, at the 65th British Academy Film Awards, Scorsese was the recipient of the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award.\\nOn September 16, 2012, Scorsese won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming and Outstanding Nonfiction Special for his work on the documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World. In 2013, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Scorsese for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government\\'s highest honor for achievement in the humanities. He was the first filmmaker chosen for the honor. His lecture, delivered on April 1, 2013, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, was titled \"Persistence of Vision: Reading the Language of Cinema\". Scorsese was awarded the Polish Gold Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis on April 11, 2017, in recognition of his contribution to Polish cinema.\\n\\nScorsese has also garnered favorable responses from numerous film giants including Ingmar Bergman, Frank Capra, Jean-Luc Godard, Werner Herzog, Elia Kazan, Akira Kurosawa, David Lean, Michael Powell, Satyajit Ray, and François Truffaut.

As of 2019, four of Scorsese\\'s films have been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In commenting on Scorsese\\'s 2019 film The Irishman, Guillermo del Toro cited Scorsese\\'s ability as a director for the depiction of character development comparable to the films of \"Renoir, Bresson, Bergman, Oliveira or Kurosawa\". Sam Mendes, in his acceptance speech after winning the 2020 Golden Globe Award for Best Director for 1917, praised Scorsese\\'s contribution to cinema, stating, \"There\\'s not one director in this room, not one director in the world, that is not in the shadow of Martin Scorsese... I just have to say that.\" Bong Joon-ho, in his acceptance speech for the 2020 Academy Award for Best Director for Parasite, said, \"When I was young and studying cinema, there was a saying that I carved deep into my heart, which is, the most personal is the most creative.\" He then said that this quote had come from Scorsese, which prompted the audience to give Scorsese a standing ovation.\\n\\nAwards and nominations\\nSee also\\nDr Catherine O\\'Brien\\'s Martin Scorsese\\'s Divine Comedy: Movies and Religion (2018).\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nMartin Scorsese on Instagram\\nMartin Scorsese at the Encyclopædia Britannica\\nMartin Scorsese at IMDb\\nMartin Scorsese at the TCM Movie Database \\nMartin Scorsese at Rotten Tomatoes\\nWorks by or about Martin Scorsese in libraries (WorldCat catalog)\\nThe Films of Martin Scorsese on YouTube, movie clip compilation, 3 min.\\nMartin Scorsese Bibliography (via UC Berkeley)\\nThey Shoot Pictures, Don\\'t They?\\n1999 Princeton Q&A lecture (RealMedia video)\\nPodcast: Scorsese Discusses His Digital Workflow Techniques\\nMartin Scorsese\\'s response to a Proust Questionnaire\\nAppearances on C-SPAN',\n",
              " 'Minority Report (film)': 'Minority Report is a 2002 American science fiction action film directed by Steven Spielberg and loosely based on the 1956 short story \"The Minority Report\" by Philip K. Dick. It is set primarily in Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia in the year 2054, where PreCrime, a specialized police department, apprehends criminals based on foreknowledge provided by psychics called \"precogs\". The cast includes Tom Cruise as Chief of PreCrime John Anderton, Colin Farrell as Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer, Samantha Morton as the senior precog Agatha, and Max von Sydow as Anderton\\'s superior Lamar Burgess.\\nThe film combines elements of tech noir, whodunit, thriller and science fiction genres, as well as a traditional chase film, as the main protagonist is accused of a crime he has not committed and becomes a fugitive. Spielberg has characterized the story as \"fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot\". The film\\'s central theme is the question of free will versus determinism. It examines whether free will can exist if the future is set and known in advance. Other themes include the role of preventive government in protecting its citizenry, the role of media in a future state where technological advancements make its presence nearly boundless, the potential legality of an infallible prosecutor, and Spielberg\\'s repeated theme of broken families.\\nThe film was first optioned in 1992, as a sequel to another Dick adaptation, Total Recall, and started its development in 1997, after a script by Jon Cohen reached Spielberg and Cruise. Production suffered many delays due to Cruise\\'s Mission: Impossible 2 and Spielberg\\'s A.I. running over schedule, eventually starting in March 2001. During pre-production, Spielberg consulted numerous scientists in an attempt to present a more plausible future world than that seen in other science fiction films, and some of the technology designs in the film have proven prescient.\\nMinority Report was one of the best-reviewed films of 2002 and was nominated for several awards. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Editing, and eleven Saturn Award nominations, including Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Saturn Award for Best Music, winning Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, Best Writing, and Best Supporting Actress. The film earned over $358 million worldwide against an overall budget of $142 million (including advertising). Over four million DVDs were sold in its first few months of home release.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn April 2054 Washington, DC\\'s prototype \"PreCrime\" police department prevents murders, via three clairvoyant humans (\"Precogs\") attached to a computer, who have an innate ability to \"previsualize\" crimes of extreme emotion and violence, before the offending suspect even begins the fatal deed. Would-be murderers are then imprisoned in a benevolent virtual reality state. Almost all premeditated, 1st degree murder has ceased, as people have \"got the message\", however spontaneous \"crimes of passion\" are still problematic, as the police have limited time to intercept the killer. The federal government is on the verge of adopting this controversial program nationwide.\\nSince the disappearance of his son Sean, PreCrime Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has separated from his wife Lara (Kathryn Morris) and become a drug addict. While United States Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is auditing the program, the Precogs generate a new prediction, stating Anderton will murder a man he does not know named Leo Crow in 36 hours. Anderton flees the area as Witwer begins a manhunt. Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith), the creator of PreCrime technology. She reveals that sometimes one of the Precogs, usually Agatha (Samantha Morton), has a different vision than the other two; a \"minority report\" of a possible alternate future. This has been kept a secret as it would damage the system\\'s credibility. Anderton resolves to recover the minority report to prove his innocence.\\nAnderton goes to a black market doctor for a risky eye transplant to avoid the citywide optical recognition system. He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha, shutting down the system, as the Precogs operate as a group mind. Anderton takes Agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of Leo Crow (Mike Binder), but none exists; instead, Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively (Jessica Harper), a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure five years prior.\\nAnderton and Agatha go to Crow\\'s hotel room as the 36-hour time nears, finding numerous photos of children, including one of Sean. Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him, accusing him of being a serial child killer. Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow—barely—by telling him that he has the ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it. Crow, however, begs to be killed, having been hired by an unknown entity to plant the photos and be killed in exchange for his family\\'s financial well-being. Crow grabs Anderton\\'s gun and pulls the trigger, killing himself as Agatha watches in horror. Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara\\'s house outside the city for refuge. There they learn Lively was Agatha\\'s drug-addicted mother who sold her to PreCrime. Lively had sobered up and attempted to reclaim Agatha, but was murdered. Anderton realizes he is being targeted for knowing about Lively\\'s existence and her connection to Agatha.\\nWitwer, studying Crow\\'s death, suspects Anderton is being framed. He examines the footage of Lively\\'s murder and finds there were two attempts on her life, the first having been stopped by PreCrime but the second, occurring minutes later, having succeeded. Witwer reports this to the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow), but Burgess responds by killing Witwer using Anderton\\'s gun. With the Precogs still offline, the murder is undetected.\\nLara had earlier called Burgess, revealing that Anderton is with her. Anderton is captured, accused of both murders, and imprisoned after being fitted with the brain device that puts him into a dreamlike sleep. Agatha is reconnected to the PreCrime system. While attempting to comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively\\'s murderer. Lara frees Anderton, who then exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha\\'s vision of Burgess killing Lively. A new report is generated at PreCrime, indicating that Burgess will kill Anderton. In a confrontation with Anderton, Burgess admits that PreCrime could not function without Agatha; he killed Lively following an actual attempt on her life that he had arranged, knowing that the murder would appear as an echo within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out the dilemma Burgess now faces: he can kill Anderton and validate PreCrime at the cost of his own life, or he can spare Anderton and allow the program to be discredited and shut down. The flaw in the system, Anderton notes, is that people can change their future once they become aware of it. Burgess commits suicide.\\nAfterwards, the PreCrime system is shut down. All the prisoners are pardoned and released, although many remain under police surveillance for years. Anderton and Lara reconcile and prepare for the birth of a new child, and the Precogs are sent away to an undisclosed location to live their lives in peace.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Chief John Anderton\\nMax von Sydow as Director Lamar Burgess\\nColin Farrell as Danny Witwer\\nSamantha Morton as Agatha Lively\\nNeal McDonough as Gordon \"Fletch\" Fletcher\\nSteve Harris as Jad Watson\\nPatrick Kilpatrick as Geoffrey Knott\\nJessica Capshaw as Evanna\\nMichael and Matthew Dickman as Arthur and Dashiell \"Dash\" Arkadin, the precog twins\\nLois Smith as Dr. Iris Hineman\\nKathryn Morris as Lara Anderton\\nPeter Stormare as Dr. Solomon P.

He created the initial script for the film with Ron Shusett and Robert Goethals (uncredited). It was supposed to be a sequel to the 1990 Dick adaptation Total Recall, which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. Novelist Jon Cohen was hired in 1997 to adapt the story for a potential film version that would have been directed by Dutch filmmaker Jan de Bont. Meanwhile, Cruise and Spielberg, who met and became friends on the set of Cruise\\'s film Risky Business in 1983, had been looking to collaborate for ten years. Spielberg was set to direct Cruise in Rain Man, but left to make Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Cruise read Cohen\\'s script, and passed it onto Spielberg, who felt it needed some work. Spielberg was not directly involved in the writing of the script, though he was allowed to decide whether the picture\\'s screenplay was ready to be filmed. When Cohen submitted an acceptable revision, he called Cruise and said, \"Yeah, I\\'ll do this version of the script.\" In that version, Witwer creates a false disk which shows Anderton killing him. When Anderton sees the clip, his belief in the infallibility of the precogs\\' visions convinces him it is true, therefore the precogs have a vision of him killing Witwer. At the end, Anderton shoots Witwer and one of the brother precogs finishes him off, because Witwer had slain his twin. Spielberg was attracted to the story because as both a mystery and a movie set 50 years in the future, it allowed him to do \"a blending of genres\" which intrigued him.In 1998, the pair joined Minority Report and announced the production as a joint venture of Spielberg\\'s DreamWorks and Amblin Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, Cruise\\'s Cruise/Wagner Productions, and De Bont\\'s production company, Blue Tulip. Spielberg however stated that despite being credited, De Bont never became involved with the film. Cruise and Spielberg, at the latter\\'s insistence, reportedly agreed to each take 15% of the gross instead of any money up front to try to keep the film\\'s budget under $100 million. Spielberg said he had done the same with name actors in the past to great success: \"Tom Hanks took no cash for Saving Private Ryan but he made a lot of money on his profit participation.\" He made this agreement a prerequisite:\\nI haven\\'t worked with many movie stars—80 per cent of my films don\\'t have movie stars—and I\\'ve told them if they want to work with me I want them to gamble along with me. I haven\\'t taken a salary in 18 years for a movie, so if my film makes no money I get no money. They should be prepared to do the same.\\nProduction was delayed for several years. The original plan was to begin filming after Cruise\\'s Mission: Impossible 2 was finished, but that film ran over schedule, which also allowed Spielberg time to bring in screenwriter Scott Frank to rework Cohen\\'s screenplay. John August did an uncredited draft to polish the script, and Frank Darabont was also invited to rewrite, but was by then busy with The Majestic. The film closely follows Scott Frank\\'s final script (completed May 16, 2001), and contains much of Cohen\\'s third draft (May 24, 1997). Frank removed the character of Senator Malcolm from Cohen\\'s screenplay, and inserted Burgess, who became the \"bad guy\". He also rewrote Witwer from a villain to a \"good guy\", as he was in the short story. In contrast to Spielberg\\'s next science fiction picture, War of the Worlds, which he called \"100 percent character\" driven, Spielberg said the story for Minority Report became \"50 percent character and 50 percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot.\" According to film scholar Warren Buckland, Cohen and Frank apparently did not see the Goldman and Schusett screenplay, but instead worked on their own adaptation. Goldman and Schusett, however, claimed the pair used a lot of material from their script, so the issue went through the Writer\\'s Guild arbitration process. They won a partial victory; they were not given writing credits, but were listed as executive producers. The film was delayed again so Spielberg could finish A.I. after the death of his friend Stanley Kubrick. When Spielberg originally signed on to direct, he planned to have an entirely different supporting cast. He offered the role of Witwer to Matt Damon, Iris Hineman to Meryl Streep, Burgess to Ian McKellen, Agatha to Cate Blanchett, and Lara to Jenna Elfman. Streep declined the role, Damon opted out, and the other roles were recast due to the delays. Spielberg also offered the role of Witwer to Javier Bardem, who turned it down.\\n\\nTechnology\\nAfter E.T., Spielberg started to consult experts, and put more scientific research into his science fiction films. In 1999, he invited fifteen experts convened by Peter Schwartz and Stewart Brand to a hotel in Santa Monica for a three-day \"think tank\". He wanted to consult with the group to create a plausible \"future reality\" for the year 2054 as opposed to a more traditional \"science fiction\" setting. Dubbed the \"think tank summit\", the experts included architect Peter Calthorpe, author Douglas Coupland, urbanist and journalist Joel Garreau, computer scientist Neil Gershenfeld, biomedical researcher Shaun Jones, computer scientist Jaron Lanier, and former Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) architecture dean William J. Mitchell. Production designer Alex McDowell kept what was nicknamed the \"2054 bible\", an 80-page guide created in preproduction which listed all the aspects of the future world: architectural, socio-economic, political, and technological. While the discussions did not change key elements in the film, they were influential in the creation of some of the more utopian aspects, though John Underkoffler, the science and technology advisor for the film, described it as \"much grayer and more ambiguous\" than what was envisioned in 1999. Underkoffler, who designed most of Anderton\\'s interface after Spielberg told him to make it \"like conducting an orchestra\", said \"it would be hard to identify anything [in the movie] that had no grounding in reality.\" McDowell teamed up with architect Greg Lynn to work on some of the technical aspects of the production design. Lynn praised his work, saying that a \"lot of those things Alex cooked up for Minority Report, like the 3-D screens, have become real.\"Spielberg described his ideas for the film\\'s technology to Roger Ebert before the movie\\'s release:\\n\\nI wanted all the toys to come true someday. I want there to be a transportation system that doesn\\'t emit toxins into the atmosphere. And the newspaper that updates itself ...\\nThe Internet is watching us now. If they want to. They can see what sites you visit. In the future, television will be watching us, and customizing itself to what it knows about us. The thrilling thing is, that will make us feel we\\'re part of the medium. The scary thing is, we\\'ll lose our right to privacy. An ad will appear in the air around us, talking directly to us.\\n\\nFilming\\nMinority Report was the first film to have an entirely digital production design. Termed \"previz\", as an abbreviation of previsualization (a term borrowed from the film\\'s narrative), production designer Alex McDowell said the system allowed them to use Photoshop in place of painters, and employ 3D animation programs (Maya and XSI) to create a simulated set, which could be filled with digital actors then used to block out shots in advance. The technology also allowed the tie-in video game and special effects companies to cull data from the previous system before the film was finished, which they used to establish parameters for their visuals. When Spielberg quickly became a fan, McDowell said \"It became pretty clear that [he] wouldn\\'t read an illustration as a finished piece, but if you did it in Photoshop and created a photorealistic environment he focused differently on it.\" Filming took place from March 22 to July 18, 2001, in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Los Angeles. Film locations included the Ronald Reagan Building (as PreCrime headquarters) and Georgetown. The skyline of Rosslyn, Virginia is visible when Anderton flies across the Potomac River. A quick shot of Indian Field Creek, which crosses the Colonial Parkway in Yorktown, Virginia, is seen as John takes Agatha to his wife\\'s house. During production, Spielberg made regular appearances on a video-only webcam based in the craft services truck, both alone and with Tom Cruise; together they conferred publicly with Ron Howard and Russell Crowe via a similar webcam on the set of \"A Beautiful Mind\" in New York.The location of the small, uncharted island in the last shot of the film is Butter Island off North Haven, Maine in the Penobscot Bay.Although it takes place in an imagined future world of advanced technology, Minority Report attempts to embody a more \"realistic\" depiction of the future. Spielberg decided that to be more credible, the setting had to keep both elements of the present and ones which specialists expected would be forthcoming. Thus Washington, D.C. as depicted in the movie keeps well-known buildings such as the Capitol and the Washington Monument, as well as a section of modern buildings on the other side of the Potomac River. Production designer Alex McDowell was hired based on his work in Fight Club and his storyboards for a film version of Fahrenheit 451 which would have starred Mel Gibson. McDowell studied modern architecture, and his sets contain many curves, circular shapes, and reflective materials. Costume designer Deborah L. Scott decided to make the clothes worn by the characters as simple as possible, so as not to make the depiction of the future seem dated.The stunt crew was the same one used in Cruise\\'s Mission: Impossible 2, and was responsible for complex action scenes. These included the auto factory chase scene, filmed in a real facility using props such as a welding robot, and the fight between Anderton and the jetpack-clad officers, filmed in an alley set built on the Warner Bros. studio lot. Industrial Light & Magic did most of the special effects, while PDI/DreamWorks was responsible for the Spyder robots. The company Pixel Liberation Front did previsualization animatics. The holographic projections and the prison facility were filmed by several roving cameras which surrounded the actors, and the scene where Anderton gets off his car and runs along the Maglev vehicles was filmed on stationary props, which were later replaced by computer-generated vehicles.\\n\\nStoryline differences\\nThe Philip K. Dick story only gives you a springboard that really doesn\\'t have a second or third act. Most of the movie is not in the Philip K. Dick story – to the chagrin of the Philip K. Dick fans, I\\'m sure.\\nLike most film adaptations of Dick\\'s works, many aspects of his story were changed in their transition to film, such as the addition of Lamar Burgess and the change in setting from New York City to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Northern Virginia. The character of John Anderton was changed from a balding and out-of-shape old man to an athletic officer in his 40s to fit its portrayer and the film\\'s action scenes. The film adds two stories of tragic families; Anderton\\'s, and that of the three pre-cogs. In the short story, Anderton is married with no children, while in the film, he is the divorced father of a kidnapped son, who is most likely deceased. Although it is implied, but unclear in the film whether Agatha is related to the twin pre-cogs, her family was shattered when Burgess murdered her mother, Anne Lively. The precogs were intellectually disabled and deformed individuals in the story, but in the film, they are the genetically mutated offspring of drug addicts. Anderton\\'s future murder and the reasons for the conspiracy were changed from a general who wants to discredit PreCrime to regain some military funding, to a man who murdered a precog\\'s mother to preserve PreCrime. The subsequent murders and plot developed from this change. The film\\'s ending also differs from the short story\\'s. In Dick\\'s story, Anderton prevents the closure of the PreCrime division, however, in the movie Anderton successfully brings about the end of the organization. Other aspects were updated to include current technology. For instance in the story, Anderton uses a punch card machine to interpret the precogs\\' visions; in the movie, he uses a virtual reality interface.\\n\\nThemes\\nThe main theme of Minority Report is the classic philosophical debate of free will versus determinism. Other themes explored by the film include involuntary commitment, the nature of political and legal systems in a high technology-advanced society, the rights of privacy in a media-dominated world, and the nature of self-perception. The film also continues to follow Spielberg\\'s tradition of depicting broken families, which he has said is motivated by his parents\\' divorce when he was a child.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe score was composed and conducted by John Williams and orchestrated by John Neufeld, with vocals by Deborah Dietrich. Williams normally enters Spielberg productions at an early stage, well before the movie starts shooting. For Minority Report however, his entry was delayed due to his work on Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, and he joined the film when it was nearly completed, leaving him scant production time. The soundtrack takes inspiration from Bernard Herrmann\\'s work. Williams decided not to focus on the science fiction elements, and made a score suitable for film noir. He included traditional noir elements such as a female singer in the Anne Lively scenes, but the \"sentimental scenes\", which Williams considered unusual for that genre, led to soothing themes for Anderton\\'s ex-wife Lara and son Sean. The track \"Sean\\'s Theme\" is described as the only one \"instantly recognizable as one of Williams\\'\" by music critic Andrew Granade. Spielberg typified it as \"a black and white score\" and said, \"I think Johnny Williams does a really nice bit of homage to Benny Herrmann.\"In an interview which appeared in The New York Times, Williams said that the choices for many of the pieces of classical music were made by the studio. He also said that while he did not know why certain pieces were chosen, Franz Schubert\\'s Symphony No. 8 (commonly known as the Unfinished Symphony), which features prominently in the film, was most likely included because Anderton was a big fan of classical music in the script. Some of the other choices, such as Gideon\\'s playing of \"Jesu, Joy of Man\\'s Desiring\" by Bach on an organ in the subterranean prison, were also in the screenplay, and he figured that \"They are some writer\\'s conception of what this character might have listened to.\" Williams did choose the minuet from a Haydn string quartet (Op. 64, No. 1) which plays on the radio in the scene where Dr. Hineman is gardening in her greenhouse. He said he picked the piece because \"It seemed to me to be the kind of thing a woman like this would play on the radio.\" James R. Oestreich in The New York Times characterized the score as \"evocative\" and said it was \"thoroughly modern\" while also being \"interlaced with striking snippets of masterworks\", including the \"lopsided waltz\" from the second movement of Tchaikovsky\\'s Symphony No. 6, known as the Pathétique.In 2019, a 2-disc limited \"expanded edition\" was released through La-La-Land Records featuring the full score as heard in the film, along with several alternate and unused tracks as bonus material.\\n\\nEnding\\nThe most commonly criticized element of the film is its ending. The film has a more traditional \"happy ending\" which contradicts the tone of the rest of the picture. This has led to speculation that this ending is the product of John\\'s imagination, caused by hallucinations from his forced coma after he is incarcerated. As one observer mused, \"The conclusion of Minority Report strikes me as a joke Spielberg played on his detractors—an act of perfectly measured deviltry.\"One critic theorized, \"Rather than end this Brazil-ian sci-fi dystopia with the equivalent of that film\\'s shot of its lobotomized hero, which puts the lie to the immediately previous scene of his imagined liberation, Spielberg tries to pass off exactly the same ending but without the rimshot, just to see if the audience is paying attention.\" Film scholars Nigel Morris and Jason P. Vest point to a line in the film as possible evidence of this. After Anderton is captured, Gideon tells him that, \"It\\'s actually kind of a rush. They say you have visions. That your life flashes before your eyes. That all your dreams come true.\" While Vest considers the blissful dream ending a possibility, he questions why Anderton did not imagine his son as having returned.Buckland expressed disappointment in the ending, but blamed Frank. He felt that given the water theme, and closely tied together tragic parent-child theme, Anderton should have ended the film by taking Agatha in his care if Spielberg wanted a happy ending. Especially since \"Anderton kidnaps Agatha from the precog pool just as his son was kidnapped from a swimming pool\" and because Anderton could act as a \"substitute parent for Agatha, and Agatha ... a substitute child for Anderton.\" This opportunity is missed however, when the precogs are sent to the remote island, and Anderton reunites with his wife; an ending which Buckland finds more \"forced\" than the \"more authentic\" path he feels he noticed.\\n\\nStyle\\nMinority Report is a futuristic film which portrays elements of a both dystopian and utopian future. The movie renders a much more detailed view of its future world than the book, and contains new technologies not in Dick\\'s story. From a stylistic standpoint, Minority Report resembles Spielberg\\'s previous film A.I., but also incorporates elements of film noir. Spielberg said that he \"wanted to give the movie a noir feel. So I threw myself a film festival. Asphalt Jungle. Key Largo. The Maltese Falcon.\" The picture was deliberately overlit, and the negative was bleach-bypassed during post-production. The scene in which Anderton is dreaming about his son\\'s kidnapping at the pool is the only one shot in \"normal\" color. Bleach-bypassing gave the film a distinctive look; it desaturated the film\\'s colors, to the point that it nearly resembles a black-and-white movie, yet the blacks and shadows have a high contrast like a film noir picture. The color was reduced by \"about 40%\" to achieve the \"washed-out\" appearance. Elvis Mitchell, formerly of The New York Times, commented that \"The picture looks as if it were shot on chrome, caught on the fleeing bumper of a late \\'70s car.\"Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński shot the movie with high-speed film in Super 35 format to increase the overall grain, which Spielberg preferred to the then-emerging digital video format. The movie\\'s camera work is very mobile, alternating between handheld and Steadicam shots, which are \"exaggerated by the use of wide angle lenses and the occasional low camera angle\" to increase the perception of movement according to film scholar Warren Buckland. Kamiński said that he never used a lens longer than 27mm, and alternated between 17, 21, and 27mm lenses, as Spielberg liked to \"keep the actors as close to the camera as possible\". He also said, \"We staged a lot of scenes in wide shots that have a lot of things happening with the frame.\" The duo also used several long takes to focus on the emotions of the actors, rather than employing numerous cuts. Spielberg eschewed the typical \"shot reverse shot\" cinematography technique used when filming characters\\' interactions in favor of the long takes, which were shot by a mobile, probing camera. McDowell relied on colorless chrome and glass objects of curved and circular shapes in his set designs, which, aided by the \"low-key contrastive lighting\", populated the film with shadows, creating a \"futuristic film noir atmosphere\".Buckland describes the film\\'s 14 minute opening sequence as the \"most abstract and complex of any Spielberg film.\" The first scene is a distorted precog vision of a murder, presented out of context. The pace of the film is sped up, slowed, and even reversed, and the movie \"jumps about in time and space\" by intercutting the images in no discernible order. When it ends, it becomes clear that the scene was presented through Agatha\\'s eyes, and that this is how previsions appear to her. Fellow scholar Nigel Morris called this scene a \"trailer\", because it foreshadows the plot and establishes the type of \"tone, generic expectations, and enigmas\" that will be used in the film. The visions of the pre-cogs are presented in a fragmented series of clips using a \"squishy lens\" device, which distorts the images, blurring their edges and creating ripples across them. They were created by a two-man production team, hired by Spielberg, who chose the \"layered, dreamlike imagery\" based on some comments from cognitive psychologists the pair consulted. In the opening\\'s next scene, Anderton is \"scrubbing the images\", by standing like a composer (as Spielberg terms it), and manipulating them, while Jad assists him. Next the family involved in the murder in Agatha\\'s vision is shown interacting, which establishes that the opening scene was a prevision. The picture then cuts back to Anderton and the precogs\\' images, before alternating between the three. The opening is self-contained, and according to Buckland acts merely as a setup for numerous elements of the story. It lasts 14 minutes, includes 171 shots, and has an average shot length of five seconds as opposed to the 6.5 second average for the entire film. The opening\\'s five-second average is attained despite \"very fast cutting\" in the beginning and ending, because the middle has longer takes, which reach 20 seconds in some instances. Spielberg also continues his tradition of \"heavily diffused backlighting\" for much of the interior shots.\\n\\nRelease\\nSpielberg typically keeps the plot points of his films closely guarded before their release, and Minority Report was no different. He said he had to remove some scenes, and a few \"F-words\" to get the film\\'s PG-13 rating. Following the disappointing box office results of Spielberg\\'s A.I., the marketing campaign for Minority Report downplayed his role in the movie and sold the film as a Cruise action thriller.Tom Rothman, chairman of the film\\'s co-financier Fox Filmed Entertainment, described the film\\'s marketing strategy thus: \"How are we marketing it? It\\'s Cruise and Spielberg. What else do we need to do?\" The strategy made sense; coming into the film, Spielberg had made 20 films which grossed a domestic total of $2.8 billion, while Cruise\\'s resume featured 23 films and $2 billion in domestic revenues. With their combined 30% take of the film\\'s box office though, sources such as BusinessWeek\\'s Ron Grover predicted the studios would have a hard time making the money needed to break even. Despite the outward optimism, as a more adult-oriented, darker film than typical blockbusters, the studio held different box office expectations for the movie than they would a more family friendly film. Entertainment Weekly projected the film would gross $40 million domestic in its opening weekend, and Variety predicted that the high concept storyline would not appeal to children and would render it a \"commercial extra-base hit rather than a home run.\"\\n\\nTheatrical run\\nMinority Report\\'s world premiere took place in New York City on June 19, 2002. An online \"popcorn cam\" broadcast live from inside the premiere. Cruise attended the London premiere the following week, and mingled with thousands of adoring fans as he walked through the city\\'s Leicester Square. It debuted at first place in the U.S. box office, collecting $35.677 million in its opening weekend, ahead of Lilo & Stitch. Forbes considered those numbers below expectations, as they gave the film a small edge over Lilo & Stitch, which debuted in second place ($35.260 million). Lilo & Stitch sold more tickets, but since much of the film\\'s attendees were children, its average ticket price was much lower. The movie opened at the top of the box office in numerous foreign markets; it made $6.7 million in 780 locations in Germany its opening weekend, and accounted for 35% of France\\'s total box office weekend office gross when it collected $5 million in 700 theaters. In Great Britain, Minority Report made $36.9 million in its first three days, in Italy, $6.2 million in its first ten, in Belgium, $815,000 in its 75 location opening weekend, and in Switzerland, $405,000 in an 80 theater opening weekend. The BBC felt the film\\'s UK performance was \"buoyed by Cruise\\'s charm offensive at last week\\'s London premiere.\" Minority Report made a total of $132 million in the United States and $226.3 million overseas.\\n\\nHome media\\nDreamWorks spent several million dollars marketing the film\\'s DVD and VHS releases. The campaign included a tie-in video game released by Activision, which contained a trailer for the movie\\'s DVD. Minority Report was successful in the home video market, selling at least four million DVDs in its first few months of release. The DVD took two years to produce. For the first time, Spielberg allowed filmmakers to shoot footage on the set of one of his films. Premiere-award-winning DVD producer Laurent Bouzereau, who would become a frequent Spielberg DVD collaborator, shot hundreds of hours of the film\\'s production in the then-new high-definition video format. It contained over an hour of featurettes which discussed various aspects of film production, included breakdowns of the film\\'s stunt sequences, and new interviews with Spielberg, Cruise, and other \"Academy Award-winning filmmakers\". The film was released on a two-disc Blu-ray by Paramount Pictures (now the owner of the early DreamWorks library) on May 16, 2010. It included exclusive extras and interactive features, such as a new Spielberg interview, that were not included in the DVD edition. The film was transferred from its \"HD master\" which retained the movie\\'s distinctive grainy appearance.\\n\\nVideo game\\nA video game based on the film titled Minority Report: Everybody Runs was developed by Treyarch, published by Activision and released on November 18, 2002, for Game Boy Advance, Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It received mixed reviews.\\n\\nReception\\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Minority Report received 90% positive reviews based on 252 critics and an average rating of 8.18/10. The site\\'s critical consensus is, \"Thought-provoking and visceral, Steven Spielberg successfully combines high concept ideas and high octane action in this fast and febrile sci-fi thriller.\" The website listed it among the best reviewed films of 2002. The film also earned an 80 out of a possible 100 on the similar review aggregating website Metacritic based on 37 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Most critics gave the film\\'s handling of its central theme (free will vs. determinism) positive reviews, and many ranked it as the film\\'s main strength. Other reviewers felt that Spielberg did not adequately tackle the issues he raised. The movie has inspired much discussion and analysis, the scope of which has been compared to the continuing analysis of Blade Runner. This discussion has advanced past the realm of standard film criticism. Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek fashioned a criticism of the Cheney Doctrine by comparing its preemptive strike methodology to that of the film\\'s PreCrime system.Richard Corliss of Time said it\\'s \"Spielberg\\'s sharpest, brawniest, most bustling entertainment since Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Mike Clark of USA Today felt it succeeded due to a \"breathless 140-minute pace with a no-flab script packed with all kinds of surprises.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly praised the film\\'s visuals, and Todd McCarthy of Variety complimented the cast\\'s performances. Film scholar Warren Buckland recommended the film, but felt that the comedic elements—aside from Stormare\\'s lines—detracted from the plot and undermined the film\\'s credibility.Several critics used their reviews to discuss Spielberg and analyze what the movie signified in his development as a filmmaker. Andrew O\\'Hehir of the online magazine Salon expressed excitement over the atypically hard edge of the movie. \"Little Steven Spielberg is all grown up now ... into of all things a superior film artist ... It\\'s too early to know whether Minority Report, on the heels of A.I., marks a brief detour in Spielberg\\'s career or a permanent change of course, but either way it\\'s a dark and dazzling spectacle.\" J. Hoberman of The Village Voice said it is \"the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since Jurassic Park.\" Randy Shulman of Metro Weekly said that \"the movie is a huge leap forward for the director, who moves once and for all into the world of adult movie making.\" Roger Ebert called the film a \"masterpiece\" and said that when most directors of the period were putting \"their trust in technology\", Spielberg had already mastered it, and was emphasizing \"story and character\" while merely using technology as a \"workman uses his tools\". Ebert eventually named the film the best film of the year. David Edelstein of Slate echoed the positive sentiments, saying \"It has been a long time since a Spielberg film felt so nimble, so unfettered, so free of self-cannibalizing.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum, then of the Chicago Reader, was less convinced. Though he approved of the movie, he derided it in his review as a superficial action film, cautioning audiences to enjoy the movie, but not \"be conned into thinking that some sort of serious, thoughtful statement is being delivered along with the roller-coaster ride.\"Andrew Sarris of the New York Observer gave the film a negative review in which he described the script as full of plot holes, the car chases as silly, and criticized the mixture of futuristic environments with \"defiantly retro costuming\". The complexity of the storyline was also a source of criticism for Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who considered the plot \"too intricate and difficult to follow\". Both Rosenbaum and Hoberman belittled the titular minority report as a \"red herring\". More positive reviews have seen it similarly, but referred to it as a \"MacGuffin\".\\n\\nAwards and honors\\nThe film earned nominations for many awards, including Best Sound Editing at the Academy Awards, and Best Visual Effects at the BAFTAs. It was nominated for eleven Saturn Awards including Best Actor for Cruise, Best Supporting Actor for von Sydow and Best Music for Williams, and won four: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction for Spielberg, Best Writing for Frank and Cohen and Supporting Actress for Morton. It was nominated for two Visual Effects Society Awards in the categories of \"Best Effects Art Direction in a Motion Picture\" and \"Best Compositing in a Motion Picture.\" It also won the BMI Film Music Award, the Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the Empire Awards for Best Actor for Cruise, Best Director for Spielberg and Best British Actress for Morton. Ebert listed Minority Report as the best film of 2002, as did online film reviewer James Berardinelli. The film was also included in top ten lists by critic Richard Roeper, and both reviewers at USA Today.In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Science Fiction Films list. Roger Ebert eventually called it one of his favorite movies of the 2000s. Likewise,The Washington Post picked Minority Report as one of the 23 best movies from 2000 to 2018.\\n\\nTelevision series\\nOn September 9, 2014, it was announced that a follow-up television series had been given a pilot commitment at Fox. Max Borenstein wrote the script and served as executive producer alongside Spielberg, Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank. The series was envisioned to be set 10 years after the film, and focused on a male precog who teams up with a female detective to find a purpose to his gift. On February 13, 2015, Daniel London and Li Jun Li joined the cast. On February 24, 2015, Laura Regan was cast as Agatha Lively, replacing Samantha Morton, who was said to have been offered to reprise the role. In March 2015, Stark Sands and Meagan Good landed the lead roles with Sands playing the role of Dash, one of the male precogs, and Good playing Lara Vega, a detective haunted by her past, who works with Dash to help him find a purpose for his gift, Li Jun Li plays Akeela, a CSI technician, Daniel London reprised his role as Wally the Caretaker from the original film and Wilmer Valderrama was cast as a police detective. The show was picked up to series by Fox on May 9, 2015, and made its broadcast debut on September 21, 2015, but was cancelled on May 13, 2016.\\n\\nSee also\\nList of films featuring surveillance\\nList of films featuring slavery\\nInchoate offense\\n\\nReferences\\nBibliography\\nBuckland, Warren (2006).

              " 'Mission: Impossible (film series)': 'Mission: Impossible is a series of American action spy films based on and a follow-on from the television series of the same name created by Bruce Geller. The series is mainly produced by and stars Tom Cruise, whose character is Ethan Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF). The films have been directed, written, and scored from various filmmakers and crew, while incorporating musical themes from the original series by Lalo Schifrin.\\nBeginning in 1996, the films (taking place starting six years after the events of the previous TV sequel series) follow the missions of the IMF\\'s main field team under the leadership of Hunt to stop an enemy force all the while preventing an impending global disaster. The series focuses on Hunt as the lead character as opposed to the ensemble cast structure of the television series, although some characters, such as Luther Stickell (played by Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg) have recurring roles in the films.\\nThe series has received a positive reception from critics and audiences alike, and is the 16th-highest-grossing film series of all time, with a worldwide gross of over $3.5 billion to date, and is often cited as one of the best action franchises to date. The sixth and most recent film, titled Mission: Impossible – Fallout, was released on July 27, 2018. The seventh and the upcoming film, with the working title Mission: Impossible 7, is scheduled to release on November 19, 2021.\\nAll of the Mission: Impossible films are co-produced and released by Paramount Pictures and are rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association.\\n\\nFilms\\nMission: Impossible (1996)\\nEthan Hunt is framed for the murder of his IMF team during a botched mission in Prague and accused of selling government secrets to an arms dealer known only as \"Max\". On the run, Ethan seeks to uncover the real traitor and clear his name.\\n\\nMission: Impossible 2 (2000)\\nEthan goes back in action and works with professional thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton).

As Ethan Hunt takes it upon himself to fulfill the original mission, the CIA begins to question his loyalty and his motives.\\n\\nFuture\\nIn January 2019, it was announced that both a seventh and an eighth Mission: Impossible were in development, with Christopher McQuarrie set to return as director of both films. Reportedly to be filmed back-to-back, the movies were originally scheduled for release on July 23, 2021 and August 5, 2022. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, these dates were changed to November 19, 2021 and November 4, 2022 respectively.In September 2019, McQuarrie announced via his Instagram account that Hayley Atwell had joined the cast for both films, which was later confirmed by the actor. Two months later, the director also revealed the involvement of Pom Klementieff and in late December Shea Whigham was confirmed as a cast member for the two upcoming movies. In January 2020, McQuarrie further announced that Nicholas Hoult had also joined the cast and Simon Pegg confirmed his return as Benji later the same month. In February 2020, McQuarrie announced that Henry Czerny would reprise his role as Eugene Kittridge from the first film, whilst Vanessa Kirby confirmed her return as Alanna/White Widow.\\n\\nCast and crew\\nCast\\nCrew\\nReception\\nBox office performance\\nCritical and public response\\nMusic\\nChange to theme music\\nThe television version is in a rarely used 54 time (an unusual time signature with five crotchets to a bar) and is difficult to dance to, as was proven by a memorable segment of American Bandstand in which teenage dancers were caught off-guard by Dick Clark\\'s playing of the Lalo Schifrin single release.\\nThe opening theme music for the first six films are stylized renditions of Schifrin\\'s original iconic theme, preserving the 54 rhythm, by Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, Michael Giacchino, Joe Kraemer and Lorne Balfe, respectively. Most of the versions included in the score also retained the 54 time signature.However, for Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr.\\'s version featured on the first film\\'s motion picture soundtrack, the time signature was changed to standard pop 44 time to make it more dance-friendly, although the intro is still in 54 time. The Limp Bizkit song \"Take a Look Around\" from the soundtrack to the second film was set to a similar 44 modification of the theme, with an interlude in 54.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nMission-Impossible series at the box office, from The Numbers',\n",
              " 'Mission: Impossible (film)': 'Mission: Impossible is a 1996 American action spy film directed by Brian De Palma and produced by and starring Tom Cruise. A continuation of both the original television series of the same name and its revived sequel series (and set six years after the events of the latter show), it is the first installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. The plot follows Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his mission to uncover the mole who has framed him for the murders of most of his Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team.\\nWork on the script had begun early with filmmaker Sydney Pollack on board, before De Palma, Steven Zaillian, David Koepp, and Robert Towne were brought in. Mission: Impossible went into pre-production without a shooting script: De Palma devised several action sequences, but Koepp and Towne were dissatisfied with the story that led up to those events. U2 band members Larry Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton produced a dance rendition of the original theme music, which became a top-ten hit in the US (receiving gold record certification) and six other countries and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.\\nMission: Impossible was a commercial success, eventually becoming the third highest-grossing film of 1996, and garnered a mostly favorable response from critics. Its success spawned the Mission: Impossible film series.\\n\\nPlot\\nJim Phelps and his latest Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team, who had just finished a mission in Kyiv, are dispatched to stop the theft of the CIA non-official cover (NOC) list from the American embassy in Prague by rogue agent Alexander Golitsyn. However, the mission unexpectedly fails: the list is stolen, Phelps is seemingly shot, his wife Claire and another agent die in a car bombing, and the rest of the team, including Golitsyn, are eliminated by unknown assassins and supposed tech malfunctions, with Ethan Hunt being the sole survivor. Meeting with IMF director Eugene Kittridge, Hunt reveals his awareness of a second IMF team sent to monitor them, and learns the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy, and the mission was a setup to lure out a mole within the IMF, who is believed to be working with an arms dealer known as \"Max\" as part of \"Job 314.\" As Hunt is the only surviving member, Kittridge suspects him of being the mole, and Hunt flees, covering his escape by using explosive chewing gum that fellow agent Jack Harmon gave him prior to the mission.\\nReturning to the Prague safe house, Hunt realizes \"Job 314\" refers to Bible verse Job 3:14, \"Job\" being the mole\\'s code name. Claire arrives at the safe house, explaining that she escaped the car bombing after Phelps aborted the mission. Hunt arranges a meeting with Max, and warns her that she has been given a fake list on a disc equipped with a tracking device. Max and her agents escape, taking Hunt with them, just before a CIA team raids their location; Hunt promises to deliver the real list in return for $10 million and Job\\'s identity. Claire chooses to join Ethan, despite his initial protests against it, stating that since she is alive, the IMF will consider her a co-conspirator to Ethan whether she goes with him or not.\\nHunt and Claire recruit two disavowed IMF agents: computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Franz Krieger. They infiltrate CIA headquarters in Langley, steal the real list while narrowly avoiding detection, and flee to London. Kittridge, detecting the theft, has Hunt\\'s mother and uncle falsely arrested for drug trafficking. He provides media coverage of the arrest, forcing Hunt to contact him from Liverpool Street Station. Hunt allows the CIA to trace him to London before hanging up, but is surprised to find Phelps nearby. Phelps recounts surviving the shooting, naming Kittridge as the mole. Hunt, however, realizes Phelps is the mole, having discovered the Bible he has been using to communicate with Max having a Gideons stamp that Phelps stole from Chicago\\'s Drake Hotel during a previous assignment known to Hunt\\'s team. Hunt, pretending to believe Phelps\\' words, pieces together how Phelps betrayed the team: he programmed the elevator to kill Jack, faked being shot, and had the car rigged to explode. Hunt also suspects Krieger in the deaths of the other IMF members, including Golitsyn, in Prague, having recognized his distinctive knife; however, he is unsure whether Claire was involved, since she recommended Krieger. Hunt arranges with Max to exchange the list aboard the TGV train to Paris the next day and secretly sends tickets to Kittridge.\\nOn the train, Hunt remotely directs Max to the list. Max verifies it and directs Hunt to the baggage car, where he can find both the money and Job. Hunt calls Claire and tells her to meet him there. Meanwhile, Stickell uses a jamming device to prevent Max from uploading the data to her servers. Claire reaches the baggage car, finds Phelps and tells him Hunt will arrive shortly. She questions the idea of killing Hunt, since they will need a fall guy, but Phelps reveals himself to be Hunt in a mask, exposing her as a co-conspirator. When the real Phelps arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Hunt dons a pair of video glasses that relays Phelps\\' image to Kittridge, blowing Phelps\\' cover as the mole.\\nPhelps threatens to kill Hunt, but kills Claire instead when she tries to talk him out of it. He climbs to the roof of the train, where Krieger is waiting with a helicopter and a tether. Angry over Claire\\'s murder, Hunt chases after him. As Jim attempts to escape, Hunt launches himself towards Jim. Hunt connects the tether to the train itself, forcing the helicopter into the Channel Tunnel after the train. Hunt attaches explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps, while himself jumping to safety. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents. Hunt is unsure about returning to the team, but on the flight home, an attendant, through a coded phrase, asks him if he wants to take on a new mission.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment and writing\\nParamount Pictures owned the rights to the television series and had tried for years to make a film version but had failed to come up with a viable treatment. Tom Cruise had been a fan of the show since he was young and thought that it would be a good idea for a film. The actor chose Mission: Impossible to be the inaugural project of his new production company and convinced Paramount to put up a $70 million budget. Cruise and his producing partner, Paula Wagner, worked on a story with filmmaker Sydney Pollack for a few months when the actor hired Brian De Palma to direct. They went through two screenplay drafts that no one liked. De Palma brought in screenwriters Steve Zaillian, David Koepp, and finally Robert Towne. When the film was green-lit Koepp was initially fired with Robert Towne being the lead writer and Koepp being brought back on later. According to the director, the goal of the script was to \"constantly surprise the audience.\" Reportedly, Koepp was paid $1 million to rewrite an original script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz. According to one project source, there were problems with dialogue and story development. However, the basic plot remained intact.The film went into pre-production without a script that the filmmakers wanted to use. De Palma designed the action sequences but neither Koepp nor Towne were satisfied with the story that would make these sequences take place. Towne ended up helping organize a beginning, middle and end to hang story details on while De Palma and Koepp worked on the plot. De Palma convinced Cruise to set the first act of the film in Prague, a city rarely seen in Hollywood films at the time. Reportedly, studio executives wanted to keep the film\\'s budget in the $40–50 million range, but Cruise wanted a \"big, showy action piece\" that took the budget up to the $62 million range. The scene that takes place in a glass-walled restaurant with a big lobster tank in the middle and three huge fish tanks overhead was Cruise\\'s idea. There were 16 tons in all of the tanks and there was a concern that when they detonated, a lot of glass would fly around. De Palma tried the sequence with a stuntman, but it did not look convincing and he asked Cruise to do it, despite the possibility that the actor could have drowned.The script that Cruise approved called for a final showdown to take place on top of a moving train. The actor wanted to use the famously fast French train the TGV but rail authorities did not want any part of the stunt performed on their trains. When that was no longer a problem, the track was not available. De Palma visited railroads on two continents trying to get permission. Cruise took the train owners out to dinner and the next day they were allowed to use it. For the actual sequence, the actor wanted wind that was so powerful that it could knock him off the train. Cruise had difficulty finding the right machine that would create the wind velocity that would look visually accurate before remembering a simulator he used while training as a skydiver. The only machine of its kind in Europe was located and acquired. Cruise had it produce winds up to 140 miles per hour so it would distort his face. Exterior shots of the train were filmed on the Glasgow South Western Line, between New Cumnock, Dumfries and Annan. Most of the sequence, however, was filmed on a stage against a blue screen for later digitizing by the visual effects team at Industrial Light & Magic.The filmmakers delivered the film on time and under budget, a rarity in Hollywood, with Cruise doing most of his own stunts. Initially, there was a sophisticated opening sequence that introduced a love triangle between Jim Phelps, his wife Claire and Ethan Hunt that was removed because it took the test audience \"out of the genre\", according to De Palma. There were rumors that  Cruise and De Palma did not get along, and these rumors were fueled when the director excused himself at the last moment from scheduled media interviews before the film\\'s theatrical release.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe film uses Lalo Schifrin\\'s original \"Theme from Mission: Impossible\". Alan Silvestri was originally hired to write the film\\'s score, but his music was rejected and replaced with a new score by composer Danny Elfman. According to some sources, Silvestri had written and recorded some 20 minutes of music, and the decision to replace him was made by producer Tom Cruise during post-production. Elfman had only a few weeks to compose and produce the final score, which used Schifrin\\'s \"The Plot\" theme in addition to his main theme, as well as new themes composed by Elfman for the characters Ethan Hunt, Claire and the IMF.U2 bandmates Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton were fans of the TV show and knew the original theme music well, but were nervous about remaking Schifrin\\'s legendary theme song. Clayton put together his own version in New York City and Mullen did his in Dublin on weekends between U2 recording sessions. The two musicians were influenced by Brian Eno and the European dance club scene sound of the recently finished album Passengers. They allowed Polygram to pick its favorite and they wanted both. In a month, they had two versions of the song and five remixed by DJs. All seven tracks appeared on a limited edition vinyl release.The song entered the top 10 of music charts around the world, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1997, and was a critical and commercial success.\\n\\nMarketing\\nApple Computer had a $15 million promotion linked to the film that included a game, print ads and television spot featuring scenes from the TV show turned into the feature film; dealer and in-theater promos; and a placement of Apple personal computers in the film. This was an attempt on Apple\\'s part to improve their image after posting a $740 million loss in its fiscal second quarter.\\n\\nReception\\nOriginal television series cast\\nSeveral cast members of the original television series that ran from 1966–73, reacted negatively to the film.\\nActor Greg Morris, who portrayed Barney Collier in the original television series, was reportedly disgusted with the film\\'s treatment of the Phelps character, and he walked out of the theater before the film ended. Peter Graves, who played Jim Phelps in the original series as well as in the late-1980s revival, also disliked how Phelps turned out in the film. Graves had been offered the chance to reprise his role from the TV series, but turned it down upon learning his character would be revealed to be a traitor.Martin Landau, who portrayed Rollin Hand in the original series, expressed his own disapproval concerning the film. In an MTV interview in October 2009, Landau stated, \"When they were working on an early incarnation of the first one — not the script they ultimately did — they wanted the entire team to be destroyed, done away with one at a time, and I was against that. It was basically an action-adventure movie and not Mission. Mission was a mind game. The ideal mission was getting in and getting out without anyone ever knowing we were there. So the whole texture changed. Why volunteer to essentially have our characters commit suicide? I passed on it ... The script wasn\\'t that good either!\"\\n\\nBox office\\nMission: Impossible opened on May 22, 1996 in a then-record 3,012 theaters, becoming the first film to be released to over 3,000 theaters in the United States, and broke the record for a film opening on Wednesday with US$11.8 million, beating the $11.7 million Terminator 2: Judgment Day made in 1991. The film also set house records in several theaters around the United States. Mission: Impossible grossed $75 million in its first six days, surpassing Jurassic Park, and took in more than $56 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, beating out The Flintstones. Cruise deferred his usual $20 million fee for a significant percentage of the box office. The film went on to make $180.9 million in North America and $276.7 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $457.6 million.\\n\\nCritical response\\nMission: Impossible received mainly positive reviews from critics. The film has a 64% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10, with the critical consensus reading, \"Full of special effects, Brian De Palma’s update of Mission: Impossible has a lot of sweeping spectacle, but the plot is sometimes convoluted\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"This is a movie that exists in the instant, and we must exist in the instant to enjoy it.\" In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden addressed the film\\'s convoluted plot: \"If that story doesn\\'t make a shred of sense on any number of levels, so what? Neither did the television series, in which basic credibility didn\\'t matter so long as its sci-fi popular mechanics kept up the suspense.\" Mike Clark of USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and said that it was \"stylish, brisk but lacking in human dimension despite an attractive cast, the glass is either half-empty or half-full here, though the concoction goes down with ease.\"However, Hal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, \"There are empty thrills, and some suspense. But throughout the film, we keep waiting for some trace of personality, some color in the dialogue, some hipness in the staging or in the characters\\' attitudes. And it\\'s not there.\" Time magazine\\'s Richard Schickel wrote, \"What is not present in Mission: Impossible (which, aside from the title, sound-track quotations from the theme song and self-destructing assignment tapes, has little to do with the old TV show) is a plot that logically links all these events or characters with any discernible motives beyond surviving the crisis of the moment.\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a \"B\" rating and said, \"The problem isn\\'t that the plot is too complicated; it\\'s that each detail is given the exact same nagging emphasis. Intriguing yet mechanistic, jammed with action yet as talky and dense as a physics seminar, the studiously labyrinthine Mission: Impossible grabs your attention without quite tickling your imagination.\"Many critics have given the CIA break-in, and the final climactic chase sequence, particular praise often in spite of their reception of the rest of the film. Both scenes have frequently featured highly on fans and critics lists of best action scenes from this series, and have been referenced many times in other subsequent works.\\n\\nAccolades\\nHome media\\nMission: Impossible was released by Paramount Home Video on VHS on November 12, 1996 and DVD on November 17, 1998. The film was released on DVD again on April 11, 2006, as a special collector\\'s edition.

              " 'Mission: Impossible 2': 'Mission: Impossible 2 (stylized as M:i-2) is a 2000 action spy film directed by John Woo and produced by and starring Tom Cruise. The sequel to 1996 film Mission: Impossible, it is the second installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. It follows Ethan Hunt as he is tasked by the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) to find and destroy a dangerous biological weapon called \"Chimera\" from rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose with the help of love interest Nyah Nordoff-Hall, Ambrose\\'s ex-girlfriend.\\nMission: Impossible 2 was released in theaters worldwide on May 24, 2000 to strong box office results, and grossed over $546 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2000, and was the highest-grossing film in the series for 11 years. The film was followed by Mission: Impossible III in 2006.\\n\\nPlot\\nBio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich sends a message to the IMF for Ethan Hunt, an old friend of his, warning that his employer, Biocyte Pharmaceuticals, forced him to develop a biological epidemic to profit from its remedy. He arranges to meet with Ethan to deliver the Chimera virus, and its cure, Bellerophon. With Ethan on holiday and incommunicado, the IMF sends agent Sean Ambrose disguised as Ethan to meet Nekhorvich on a passenger plane. Ambrose goes rogue, killing Nekhorvich and stealing Bellerophon before his men destroy the plane.\\nIMF Commander Swanbeck informs Ethan of the circumstances of Nekhorvich\\'s death and they determine Ambrose is responsible. Swanbeck tasks Ethan with recovering the virus and its cure, and has him recruit Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in Seville, Spain. Nyah was recruited as a part of the team to trace Ambrose and his team since she is Ambrose\\'s ex-girlfriend. Ethan reluctantly convinces her to spy on Ambrose.\\nEthan assembles his team, computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird, in Sydney, Australia, where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah rekindles her former relationship with Ambrose and relays information to Ethan\\'s team. At a horse racing event, Ambrose meets with Biocyte\\'s CEO, John C. McCloy. He shows McCloy a memory card video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich\\'s colleagues before blackmailing McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals the camera\\'s memory card and delivers it to Ethan. They learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim\\'s red blood cells. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. When Nyah discreetly returns the memory card to Ambrose, he notices it is in the wrong pocket of his jacket.\\nEthan\\'s team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, the only Bellerophon samples were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose\\'s hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus; unbeknownst to him at the time, Nekhorvich injected himself with Chimera to smuggle it out of Biocyte. Ambrose plans to exchange a sample of Bellerophon to McCloy for a sample of Chimera. Ethan\\'s team breaks into Biocyte to destroy the virus before the exchange can take place. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing the plan, then captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of Chimera before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues, culminating in the sample being dropped on the floor between Ambrose and Ethan. Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the sample; she instead injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from simply killing her after she retrieved it for him. Nyah insists that Ethan kill her to destroy the virus but Ethan is unwilling to do so. Ambrose takes Nyah away as Ethan escapes from the laboratory.\\nAmbrose releases Nyah to wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a pandemic. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options, to make him Biocyte\\'s majority shareholder. He predicts that the price of Biocyte\\'s stock will skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon after the Chimera outbreak. Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose\\'s men, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent the eventual outbreak. Ethan kills Ambrose\\'s men but Ambrose chases him to a beach where Ethan defeats him in a brutal fistfight. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan at the beach. As Ethan is about to give Luther the Bellerophon canister, Ambrose recovers and points a gun at Ethan. Ethan throws the canister to Luther and jumps away from Ambrose\\'s shot while kicking up a gun from the sand which he uses to finally kill Ambrose. Luther injects Nyah with the Bellerophon in time to cure her.\\nIMF clears Nyah\\'s criminal record and Ethan starts his vacation with her in Sydney.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nAccording to screenwriter Robert Towne several action sequences were already planned for the film prior to his involvement and before the story had been written.The studio expressed concern over the safety of shooting Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)\\'s entrance in the film, where he is free solo climbing in Moab, Utah\\'s Dead Horse Point State Park. Cruise refused to drop the idea because he could not think of a better way to reintroduce the character. There was no safety net as he filmed the sequence, but he did have a harness. He tore his shoulder when performing the jump from one part of the cliff to another. Most of the scenes were also shot in Sydney, Australia.\\nIn a 2020 interview, Thandie Newton spoke about her tense on-set experiences with Cruise when filming the movie.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe film\\'s original score was composed and conducted by Hans Zimmer and features vocals performed by Lisa Gerrard. In addition, the film includes contemporary music such as Limp Bizkit\\'s rendition of Lalo Schifrin\\'s Mission: Impossible theme entitled \"Take a Look Around\" as well as Metallica\\'s \"I Disappear\".While Ethan is rock climbing during his holiday, Zap Mama\\'s remixed version of \"Iko Iko\" plays on the soundtrack.\\n\\nRelease\\nIn its North American opening weekend, the film grossed $57,845,297, ranking at #1. It held on to the No. 1 spot for three weekends. The film eventually grossed $215,409,889 in its North American release and $330,978,216 in other territories, totaling $546,388,105 worldwide, the highest-grossing film of 2000. It is John Woo\\'s highest grossing film of all time, surpassing Face/Off, and was the highest-grossing film in the Mission: Impossible series at the time of release, holding the record for eleven years before being surpassed by Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.\\nMission: Impossible 2 was released on VHS and DVD on November 7, 2000, with a rare Japanese LaserDisc release following on April 3, 2001 (released extremely late in the format\\'s life), with a potential North American release of this LaserDisc being cancelled in mid-2001. A Blu-ray release followed on June 3, 2008, and an Ultra HD Blu-ray version was released on June 26, 2018.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes indicates the film has an overall approval rating of 57% based on 143 reviews and an average score of 5.9/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Your cranium may crave more substance, but your eyes will feast on the amazing action sequences\". Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 40 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, down from the first film\\'s \"B+\".Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said that \"if the first movie was entertaining as sound, fury, and movement, this one is more evolved, more confident, more sure-footed in the way it marries minimal character development to seamless action.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly felt the film was a \"throwaway pleasure\" but also \"a triumph of souped-up action.\" Ella Taylor of LA Weekly said that \"every car chase, every plane crash, every potential drop off a cliff is a masterpiece of grace and surprise.\" Desson Howe of The Washington Post said that \"[John] Woo [...] takes complete command of the latest technology to create brilliant action sequences.\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, \"Check your brains at the popcorn stand and hang on for a spectacular ride.\"J. Hoberman of The Village Voice called the film \"a vaguely absurd thriller filled with elaborately superfluous setups and shamelessly stale James Bond riffs.\" Dennis Harvey of Variety said the film is \"even more empty a luxury vehicle than its predecessor\" and that it \"pushes the envelope in terms of just how much flashy packaging an audience will buy when there\\'s absolutely nada inside.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader said that \"no hero or villain winds up carrying any moral weight at all.\"In a retrospective commentary in 2012, Brad Brevet noted the film has significant similarities in plot and themes to Alfred Hitchcock\\'s 1946 film Notorious.Mission: Impossible 2 was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards at the 2000 ceremony, including Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Supporting Actress for Thandie Newton. It was also nominated for a Stinker Award at the 2000 ceremony for Worst Song (Limp Bizkit\\'s \"Take a Look Around\").A comedy short titled Mission: Improbable was shown during the 2000 MTV Movie Awards.

The film stars Cruise, Ving Rhames, Henry Czerny, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Angela Bassett and Frederick Schmidt, all of whom reprise their roles from the previous films, along with Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham, and Esai Morales, who will join the franchise.\\nMission: Impossible 7 is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 19, 2021, by Paramount Pictures, followed by a streaming release on Paramount+ on January 3, 2022. \\nA direct sequel, also directed by McQuarrie, is scheduled be released on November 4, 2022.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent and leader of a team of operatives.\\nVing Rhames as Luther Stickell, an IMF agent, a member of Hunt\\'s team and his closest friend.\\nSimon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent and a member of Hunt\\'s team.\\nRebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, a former MI6 agent who allied with Hunt\\'s team during Rogue Nation and Fallout.\\nVanessa Kirby as Alanna Mitsopolis, a black market arms dealer also known as the White Widow.

McQuarrie described Atwell\\'s character as a \"destructive force of nature\", while Atwell explained that her character\\'s loyalties are \"somewhat ambiguous\" and said, \"I\\'ve been living in an existential crisis since October, going \\'who am I? who am I?\\' An actor in search of a character... There\\'s ambiguity…the interesting thing we\\'re exploring is her resistance to a situation she finds herself in. How she starts off, where she becomes. The journey of what she comes into and what is asked of her and potentially where she ends up.\"\\n\\nProduction\\nAnnouncement and casting\\nOn January 14, 2019, Cruise initially announced that the seventh and eighth Mission: Impossible films would be shot back-to-back with McQuarrie writing and directing both films for July 23, 2021, and August 5, 2022 releases. However, in February 2021, Deadline Hollywood revealed that Paramount had decided to no longer move forward with that plan.In February 2019, Ferguson confirmed her return for the seventh installment. In September 2019, McQuarrie announced on his Instagram profile that Hayley Atwell had joined the cast. In September 2019, Pom Klementieff joined the cast for both the seventh and eighth films. In December 2019, Simon Pegg confirmed his return for the film, with Shea Whigham cast for both films. Nicholas Hoult was cast in a role in January 2020, along with the addition of Henry Czerny, reprising his role as Eugene Kittridge for the first time since the 1996 film. Vanessa Kirby also announced she was returning for both films. In May 2020, it was reported that Esai Morales would replace Hoult as the villain in both films due to scheduling conflicts.\\n\\nFilming and COVID-19 shutdown\\nUnder the working title Libra, filming was scheduled to begin on February 20, 2020, in Venice, set up to last for three weeks before moving to Rome in mid-March for 40 days, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, production in the country was halted. Three weeks later, stunt rehearsals began in Surrey, England, just before a hiatus. On July 6, 2020, after another hiatus, crew arriving in the UK were given permission to begin filming without going through the mandatory 14-day quarantine. The set is located at Warner Bros Studios, Leavesden in Hertfordshire.The following month, similar permission was granted for filming in Møre og Romsdal, Norway. That same month, a large fire broke out on a motorcycle stunt rig in Oxfordshire. The scene had taken six weeks to prepare and was \"among one of the most expensive ever filmed in the U.K.\" No one was hurt in the incident.Filming began on September 6, 2020, when McQuarrie started to publish pictures from the sets on his Instagram profile. In October 2020, across Norway, when the previous installment was filmed in Preikestolen, including the municipalities of Stranda and Rauma, with Cruise sighted filming an action scene with Esai Morales atop a train. On October 26, 2020, production was halted in Italy after 12 people tested positive for COVID-19 on set. Filming resumed a week later.In December 2020, during filming in London, an audio recording of Cruise shouting at two production crew members for breaking COVID-19 protocols on set was released online. Cruise was likened to his character Les Grossman from the 2008 film Tropic Thunder as a result. The response from the general public, and that of many celebrities, was supportive; suggesting that his tone, and seriousness were warranted given the extreme circumstances and burden of ensuring production not be halted again. Others took it more negatively, with Leah Remini calling him an “abusive dictator”, blaming Scientology, and suggesting that the rant felt staged.On December 28, 2020, Variety reported that the film would conclude principal photography at Longcross Film Studios in the United Kingdom with production shifting from Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden. Longcross, which is in Surrey in Southeast England, falls within Tier 4, although productions are allowed to continue under strict COVID-19 protocols. In February 2021, filming concluded in the Middle East and the crew would return to London for some \"finishing touches\". It was also announced it was no longer filming directly back-to-back with the eighth film.\\n\\nPolish railway bridge controversy\\nIn late 2019, during the pre-production of the film, a rough concept of a sequence set in Alps in Switzerland included a train going 60 miles an hour through a bridge being blown up, as a reference to the climactic train wreck scene in the 1926 silent film The General. The Swiss government refused to authorize any explosions, therefore the Skydance Media production team embarked on location scouts in different countries to find an unwanted railway bridge. Among those asked to help with staging a \"full-scale train crash\" was Polish-American film producer Andrew Eksner. In November 2019, the Polish State Railways proposed Eksner to use a 151-meter long, 1908 post-German riveted truss bridge on Lake Pilchowickie [pʲilxɔvʲit͡skʲɛ] [pl; es], in the Jelenia Góra Valley, in Lower Silesia. In December 2019, Paramount Pictures producers including McQuarrie landed in southern Poland, accompanied in deep secrecy by officers of the Polish engineering troops. McQuarrie documented the visit on his Instagram profile. For carrying out the Libra project on site, the selected Polish production company Alex Stern was granted a PLN 5.5 million ($1.5 million) cash rebate from the Polish Film Institute.Officially opened in 1912 by Wilhelm II himself, the proposed bridge survived World War II mostly intact, and was used by trains until 2016, when the line was temporarily closed due to the bad condition of the tracks. Despite publicly praising the bridge \"extremely valuable,\" an expert misrepresented conclusions of a commissioned report, that instead of renovating, it would be best to demolish the bridge before building a new one. In March 2020, after rejected Eksner spread the information, local authorities and museum officials were appalled by the producers\\' intention to physically destroy the bridge, instead of using CGI effects. The filmmakers and authorities said the bridge was devastated and intended for demolition anyway.By July 2020, history and railways enthusiasts protested, as did some scientists, filmmakers, and the regional Monuments Heritage Office, along with members of Polish parliament, and The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage. Activists and NGOs launched a petition against the destruction. And as it was long registered provincially, and now being added into Poland\\'s national Registry of Objects of Cultural Heritage, the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage confirmed it was pushing the bridge to play in the movie, with a \"small section\" to be demolished onset in April 2021, before revitalizing the related local heritage railway line altogether. Following the backlash, the General Conservator of Monuments assured there was no question of destroying the bridge.In August 2020, as the story turned international, McQuarrie said there was never a plan to blow up the bridge, and that only unsafe and partially damaged portions could have been destroyed, which needed to be rebuilt, concluding: \"To open up the area to tourism, the bridge needed to go.\" He later added that “there was no disrespect intended.” The production company did not pledge to cover construction costs of a potential new bridge, nor the renovation of the historic one. On August 18, 2020, cultural heritage registration procedures for the Lake Pilchowickie bridge were finalized, effectively preventing it from any damage. Although the Polish State Railways have offered an alternative bridge to be blown up – a disused 1910, 245-meter-long railway bridge over Warta, in west-central Poland – the provincial Conservator initiated its immediate addition into the national Registry. In August 2020, the scouting for another bridge was ongoing.\\n\\nMusic\\nIn early May 2020, the composer Lorne Balfe was confirmed to be returning to compose a score for the seventh and eighth Mission: Impossible films, after scoring the sixth one.\\n\\nRelease\\nMission: Impossible 7 is scheduled to be released on November 19, 2021. It was originally set for release on July 23, 2021, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film will then be available to stream on Paramount+ 45 days after its theatrical debut.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nMission: Impossible 7 at IMDb',\n",
              " 'Mission: Impossible III': 'Mission: Impossible III (stylized as M:i:III) is a 2006 American action spy film co-written and directed by J. J. Abrams (in his directorial debut), co-written by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and co-produced by and starring Tom Cruise in the role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt. It is the third installment in the Mission: Impossible film series, following 2000\\'s Mission: Impossible 2. In the film, Ethan (Cruise) has retired from field work for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) and trains new recruits. However, he is sent back into action to track down the elusive arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman).\\nMission: Impossible III premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 26, 2006, and was released in the United States on May 5, 2006. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who considered it an improvement over its predecessors, and was a commercial success, grossing over $397 million against a $150 million budget. It was followed by Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol in 2011.\\n\\nPlot\\nEthan Hunt has retired from field work for the IMF. He instead trains new recruits while settling down with his fiancée, Julia Meade, a nurse who is unaware of Ethan\\'s true job. He is approached by IMF Assistant Director of Operations John Musgrave about a mission to rescue one of Ethan\\'s protégés, Lindsey Farris. Lindsey was captured while investigating arms dealer Owen Davian. Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner Luther Stickell.\\nThe team rescues Lindsey in Berlin and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey\\'s head. Before he can disable it, it kills her. IMF Director Theodore Brassel reprimands Ethan and Musgrave. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic microdot under the stamp.\\nIMF technician Benji Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in Vatican City to obtain a mysterious object codenamed the \"Rabbit\\'s Foot\". Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospital\\'s chapel. The team infiltrates Vatican City and captures Davian.\\nOn the return flight, Ethan threatens to drop Davian from the plane as he interrogates him about the Rabbit\\'s Foot, but Davian refuses to reveal anything. After landing, Ethan learns that the microdot contains a video of Lindsey warning that Brassel is seemingly working with Davian. The convoy taking Davian across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel is ambushed by mercenaries, who extract Davian. Realizing Julia is also in danger, Ethan races to Julia\\'s workplace, only to discover she has already been kidnapped. Davian calls Ethan and gives him 48 hours to recover the Rabbit\\'s Foot in exchange for Julia\\'s life. Before Ethan can, he is captured by the IMF.\\nMusgrave takes part in Ethan\\'s interrogation. He discreetly mouths that the Rabbit\\'s Foot is located in Shanghai and assists Ethan in escaping. Ethan is declared an enemy of the state and placed on Interpol\\'s most wanted list.\\nEthan secretly travels to Shanghai, where Declan, Zhen, and Luther, sent by Musgrave under the guise of another operation, assist him in acquiring the Rabbit\\'s Foot. As he delivers the Rabbit\\'s Foot to the meeting point, Ethan is tranquilized. When he comes to, a micro-explosive is implanted in his head. Restrained, Ethan sees Davian holding Julia at gunpoint, gagged to a chair. Despite Ethan asserting that he brought the real Rabbit\\'s Foot, Davian shoots Julia and leaves. Musgrave arrives and reveals himself as the IMF traitor; he explains that Julia is still alive, and the woman killed was Davian\\'s head of security disguised as Julia, executed for failing to protect him in Vatican City. The ruse was to confirm the authenticity of the Rabbit\\'s Foot. He arranged for Davian to acquire the Rabbit\\'s Foot and sell it to a terrorist group so that IMF would have reason to launch a preemptive strike, to increase the American military presence in the Middle East.\\nWhen Musgrave lets his guard down, Ethan knocks him unconscious. He frees himself and uses Musgrave\\'s phone to track the last call\\'s location to find Julia. With help from Benji on the phone, he locates the place but encounters Davian and some of his henchmen. Ethan kills the henchmen, but Davian arms the explosive in Ethan\\'s head. Ethan fights and kills Davian. He comes back to free Julia and jury-rigs an impromptu defibrillator to deactivate the explosive. Julia fights off and kills a henchman, then Musgrave, who is carrying the Rabbit\\'s Foot. She resuscitates Ethan, who explains his true IMF career to her.  Back in the US, Brassel and others congratulate Ethan as he leaves for his honeymoon with Julia.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nIn 2002, director David Fincher was slated to direct the next installment of the Mission: Impossible film series for a summer of 2004 release date. Fincher, however, dropped out in favor of another film, later citing creative differences over the direction of the series. Replacing Fincher was director Joe Carnahan, who worked on developing the film for 15 months. Under his involvement, the film was to feature \"Kenneth Branagh playing a guy who\\'s based on Timothy McVeigh,\" as well as Carrie-Anne Moss and Scarlett Johansson in other roles. Thandie Newton was offered to reprise her role as Nyah Nordoff-Hall from Mission: Impossible 2 but she declined, in order to concentrate on her family. Her role in the story was later changed to a new character named Leah Quint, who would have been played by Moss. However, once J.J. Abrams took over directing the project, the character was scrapped.After a dispute over the film\\'s tone, Carnahan quit in July 2004. Tom Cruise then called J. J. Abrams, offering the directorial role for the film after having binge-watched the first two seasons of Alias. Abrams ultimately signed on and production was delayed a year due to his contractual obligations with Alias and Lost. During this time, Branagh, Moss, and Johansson departed from the project because of the many delays in production. On June 8, 2005, Paramount Pictures gave the film the green-light after a new cast of actors was hired and the film\\'s budget was redeveloped, and Cruise took a major pay cut.\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography began in Rome, Italy on July 12, 2005 and ended in October. Location filming took place in China (Shanghai and Xitang), Germany (Berlin), Italy (Rome and Caserta), the United States (California, Virginia and Maryland), and Vatican City. The night scenes involving the skyscrapers were filmed in Shanghai, while some of the Shanghai filming was also done in Los Angeles.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe film\\'s musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino. He is the third composer to take on the series, following Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer. The score album was released on May 9, 2006 by Varèse Sarabande Records. Unlike the previous installments, no soundtrack album featuring the film\\'s contemporary music was released. Despite this, the film features a song by Kanye West entitled \"Impossible\" that also features Twista, Keyshia Cole and BJ.\\n\\nDistribution\\nMarketing\\nTo promote the film, Paramount rigged 4,500 randomly selected Los Angeles Times vending boxes with digital audio players which would play the theme song when the door was opened. The audio players did not always stay concealed, and in many cases came loose and fell on top of the stack of newspapers in plain view, with the result that they were widely mistaken for bombs. Police bomb squads detonated a number of the vending boxes and even temporarily shut down a veterans hospital in response to the apparent \"threat\". Despite these problems, Paramount and the Los Angeles Times opted to leave the audio players in the boxes until two days after the movie\\'s opening.\\n\\n\"Trapped in the Closet\" controversy\\nA blog entry of Hollywoodinterrupted.com in March 2006 alleged that Viacom (parent of Paramount and Comedy Central) canceled the rebroadcast of the South Park episode \"Trapped in the Closet\" due to threats by Cruise to refuse to participate in the Mission: Impossible III publicity circle. These assertions were soon also reported by E! News and American Morning.Fox News attributed threats from Cruise, stating, \"to back out of his Mission: Impossible III promotional duties if Viacom didn\\'t pull a repeat of the episode\", as evidence of \"bad blood\" between Cruise and Viacom. The Washington Post reported that South Park fans \"struck back\", in March 2006, and threatened to boycott Mission: Impossible III until Comedy Central put \"Trapped in the Closet\" back on its schedule. Melissa McNamara of CBS News later questioned whether this boycott hurt the film\\'s box office debut. Political blogger Andrew Sullivan encouraged a boycott of the film, based on claims that Cruise allegedly forced Comedy Central to censor a South Park episode about Scientologists. \"Make sure you don\\'t go see Paramount\\'s Mission: Impossible III, Cruise\\'s upcoming movie,\" Sullivan wrote. \"I know you weren\\'t going to see it anyway. But now any money you spend on this movie is a blow against freedom of speech. Boycott it. Tell your friends to boycott it.\"When asked in ABC\\'s Primetime about his involvement with stopping the episode rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated \"First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here\\'s the thing: I\\'m really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn\\'t really even know about it. I\\'m working, making my movie, I\\'ve got my family. I\\'m busy. I don\\'t spend my days going, \\'What are people saying about me?\\'\"\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nOpening in 4,054 theaters all across the United States, the fourth largest opening ever up to that point, the film topped the box office in its opening weekend. It made $16.6 million on its opening day and $47.7 million in its opening weekend, a solid opening yet almost $10 million lower than the franchise\\'s previous films.

It was the second movie in 2006 to pass the $100,000,000 mark in the box office, following Ice Age: The Meltdown. The $134 million domestic run was significantly lower than that of Mission: Impossible 2.Outside the US, the film grossed $70 million during its first five days (in some Asian countries, it opened two days ahead of its North American release date) and was easily the box-office champion in many countries.

Club said the film is \"business as usual, but it\\'s the best kind of business as usual, and it finds everyone working in top form.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called Mission: Impossible III \"a gratifyingly clever, booby-trapped thriller that has enough fun and imagination and dash to more than justify its existence.\" Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle said that \"it\\'s all poppycock, of course, but it\\'s done with such vim and vigor and both narrative and visual flair that you care not a jot.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film a score of two and a half stars out of four, saying that it \"provides lots of action, but too little excitement.\"Ian Nathan of Empire said that Mission: Impossible III has \"an inspired middle-hour pumped by some solid action\" but added that \"we now live in a post-Bourne, recalibrated-Bond universe, where Ethan Hunt looks a bit lost.\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that \"Hoffman enlivens Mission: Impossible III\" but criticized the film\\'s \"maudlin romance\" and \"Abrams\\'s inability to adapt his small-screen talent to a larger canvas.\" Rob Nelson of the Dallas Observer said that \"Abrams\\'s movie is too oppressive, too enamored of its brutality to deliver anything like real thrills; its deeply unpleasant tone nearly makes you long even for [Mission: Impossible 2 director John] Woo\\'s cartoon absurdities.\"Claudia Puig of USA Today said that \"Mission: Impossible III delivers\" despite \"a sense that the franchise is played out and its star over-exposed.\" Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide described the film as \"breezy, undemanding, and a carefully balanced blend of the familiar and the not-quite-what-you-expected.\" Lawrence Toppman of The Charlotte Observer said that Mission: Impossible III is \"plenty of fun\" despite being \"overwrought and overplotted.\"Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat said that \"you may be mildly entertained, but damned if you\\'ll remember any of it five minutes later.\" Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com said that \"Cruise is the single bright, blinking emblem of the failure of Mission: Impossible III.\" William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer remarked that \"the latest [Mission: Impossible film] is just this side of insultingly stupid.\" Shawn Levy of The Oregonian said that Mission: Impossible III \"feels like one of the more forgettable James Bond films—saddled, moreover, with a star who\\'s sliding into self-parody.\"\\n\\nHome media\\nMission: Impossible III was released on DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray on October 30, 2006, the first film by a studio to be released simultaneously in all three formats.

              " 'Mission: Impossible – Fallout': 'Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a 2018  action spy film written, produced, and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. It is the sixth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series, and the second film to be directed by McQuarrie following the 2015 film Rogue Nation, making him the first director to direct more than one film in the franchise. The cast includes Tom Cruise,\\nVing Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Michelle Monaghan, and Alec Baldwin all of whom reprise their roles from the previous films, along with Henry Cavill, Vanessa Kirby, and Angela Bassett, who join the franchise. In the film, Ethan Hunt and his team must track down missing plutonium while being monitored by a CIA agent after a mission goes wrong.\\nTalks for a sixth Mission: Impossible film began prior to the release of Rogue Nation in 2015. The film was officially announced in November 2015, with McQuarrie confirming his return as writer and director, as well as producer alongside J. J. Abrams and Cruise, the seventh collaboration between the pair. Jeremy Renner confirmed that he was unable to appear in the film due to scheduling conflicts with Avengers: Endgame. Filming took place from April 2017 to March 2018, in Paris, London, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Arab Emirates. Production was notably put on-hold for two months following an injury to Cruise in August 2017.\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout had its world premiere in Paris on July 12, 2018, and was released in the United States on July 27, 2018; it was the first in the series to be released in RealD 3D, and also had an IMAX release. It grossed $791 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of Cruise\\'s career, and the highest-grossing film in the franchise, surpassing Ghost Protocol. It received critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay, cinematography, action sequences, stunts, musical score and acting, and is considered by many critics to be the best installment in the franchise.Two untitled sequels, one of them being Mission: Impossible 7, are both scheduled to be released in November 2021 and 2022, respectively, both directed by McQuarrie.\\n\\nPlot\\nTwo years after anarchist Solomon Lane\\'s capture, the remnants of his organization of rogue clandestine operatives, the Syndicate, continue to wreak havoc around the globe and have reorganized as a terrorist group known as the Apostles. They are allied with a mysterious extremist known as John Lark, who wrote a manifesto calling for the destruction of the current world order.\\nAt a safe house in Belfast, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in Berlin from Eastern European gangsters, before the Apostles can. He is joined by Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell for the mission, but the team fails when Stickell is captured. Hunt\\'s attempt to save Stickell allows agents of the arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis (aka the White Widow) to seize the plutonium. The IMF team later captures nuclear weapons expert Nils Delbruuk, whose security clearance was revoked due to his anti-religious bigotry, and who designed nuclear bombs for the Apostles. Delbruuk explains the Apostles\\' credo that \"there has never been great peace without first a great suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.\" Using a fake broadcast of Dunn posing as Wolf Blitzer, they trick Delbruuk into unlocking a phone that he used to communicate with Lark.\\nFurious at the IMF\\'s failure to secure the plutonium, CIA Director Erika Sloane instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker to shadow Hunt as he attempts to retrieve it. Hunt and Walker infiltrate a nightclub party in Paris where Lark is believed to be buying the cores from Mitsopolis, who is acting as the middleman in the sale of the plutonium. They track a man whom they suspect to be Lark, but after fighting him in a restroom, the man is killed by MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. Hunt assumes the role of Lark without a disguise, and escapes from hitmen sent to kill both Lark and Mitsopolis.\\nIn exchange for the plutonium, Mitsopolis tasks Hunt with extracting Lane from an armored convoy moving through Paris. She provides one of the plutonium cores as a down payment. To prevent Mitsopolis and her brother Zola from killing local police, Hunt and Walker preemptively attack the convoy. Ramming Lane\\'s vehicle into water, they lead police and Mitsopolis\\'s men on a chase across Paris while Dunn and Stickell, in a watercraft, secure Lane. Faust reappears and attempts to kill Lane to prove her loyalty to MI6, but the extraction is successful. Mitsopolis instructs Hunt to deliver both Lane and Faust to London.\\nAt a London safe house, IMF Secretary Alan Hunley reveals evidence doctored by Walker and passed to Sloane, stating Hunt is the real Lark. Eventually, Hunt, the team, and Hunley trick Walker into admitting he is the real Lark and inform Sloane, who sends in a CIA unit to take everyone into custody for transfer to Washington, D.C. However, the CIA unit had been infiltrated by the Apostles, and Walker orders the infiltrators to attack. Walker kills Hunley and escapes, after Hunt chases him across London. As he departs for India with Lane, Walker instructs Hunt to turn himself in and admit that he is Lark or else Hunt\\'s ex-wife Julia will be harmed.\\nThe team deduces that Lane and Walker plan to detonate the remaining two nuclear bombs at a medical camp over the Siachen Glacier, contaminating the water supply of India, Pakistan, and China; with a third of its population affected, the world will descend into an anarchy from which the Apostles hope a new world order will emerge. As the bombs are linked by a failsafe, any attempt to defuse one bomb without the detonator, automatically triggers the other.\\nUpon arrival in Kashmir, Hunt discovers Julia and her new husband Erik are assigned to the medical camp, an arrangement made by Walker to increase the pressure on Hunt. Lane programs the bombs\\' detonator with a 15-minute countdown and gives it to Walker, choosing to remain behind with the bombs. Walker takes off, secretly pursued by Hunt while Dunn, Stickell, and Faust try to find and defuse the nuclear weapons. Stickell attempts to deactivate the first bomb with Julia\\'s help, but they are unable to without the detonator. Faust and Dunn find the second bomb and are ambushed by Lane and subdue him after an intense fight. Following an aerial chase, Hunt uses a commandeered helicopter to ram Walker\\'s helicopter out of the sky. After a fight on a cliff, Walker is killed. Hunt then secures the detonator, allowing the team to deactivate the nukes.\\nIn the aftermath, Sloane hands Lane over to MI6 through Mitsopolis, with Faust earning her exoneration. Julia tells Hunt that he has given her the best life, despite his commitment to the IMF. Faust and the team join Hunt in celebration.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent and leader of a team of operatives\\nHenry Cavill as August Walker, a CIA assassin working for the Special Activities Division tasked with monitoring Ethan and his team\\nVing Rhames as Luther Stickell, an IMF agent and a member of Hunt\\'s team and his closest friend\\nRebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, a former MI6 agent who allied with Hunt\\'s team during Rogue Nation\\nSimon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent and a member of Hunt\\'s team\\nSean Harris as Solomon Lane, an anarchist mastermind who was the leader of the Syndicate during Rogue Nation\\nVanessa Kirby as Alanna Mitsopolis, a black-market arms dealer also known as the White Widow.

Wolf Blitzer makes a cameo appearance as himself, a disguise worn by Dunn.\\n\\nProduction\\nPre-production\\nOn May 23, 2015, The Tracking Board reported that Paramount Pictures was developing a sixth Mission: Impossible film, with Tom Cruise, J. J. Abrams, David Ellison, and Dana Goldberg returning to produce, along with Don Granger and Matt Grimm as executive producers, and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development. On July 28, 2015, Cruise confirmed on The Daily Show that a sixth film was already being developed, and told its host Jon Stewart that the filming would \"probably\" commence in summer 2016. On August 2, 2015, Paramount executive Rob Moore told Variety that the sequel was already in the works, stating that they were \"very happy to be developing this movie with Tom,\" and \"there has to be another movie.\" On November 19, 2015, it was announced that Paramount had again hired Christopher McQuarrie to write the film, while it was possible that he would also direct again, and the studio was moving fast, with plans to begin shooting in August 2016. On November 30, 2015, McQuarrie confirmed through his Twitter account that he would be back for directing duty as well, and also produce the film along with Cruise. \\nOn August 19, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Paramount had halted pre-production on the film due to a dispute over salary between Cruise and the studio, as Cruise wanted to be paid equal to or more than his fee for the Universal Pictures film The Mummy. On September 16, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Cruise\\'s dispute with the studio had been resolved, and production would now begin in spring 2017. In November, Jeremy Renner—who portrayed William Brandt in the fourth and fifth films—stated that he was unsure if he would be part of the sixth film, due to scheduling conflicts with Marvel Studios\\' Avengers: Endgame (2019). In March 2017, it was confirmed at CinemaCon that he would not return for the sixth film.In February, McQuarrie revealed that the film would include more backstory to Ethan Hunt\\'s personal life. On June 13, 2017, Michelle Monaghan was announced to return as Ethan Hunt\\'s wife Julia Meade-Hunt.\\n\\nFilming\\nFilming was slated to start in Paris on April 10, 2017. Other locations included London, New Zealand and Norway. Filming officially began on April 8. Some of the filming also took place in New Zealand in July 2017. The municipality of Forsand in Norway allowed the closing of Preikestolen for a time in autumn for the film\\'s shoot; only crew members and cast were allowed to approach the mountain for nine consecutive days. They also were allowed up to 50 helicopter landings per day. The scenes set in the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir were shot in New Zealand. Director Christopher McQuarrie said that he wanted the climax of the film to be set in a more \"politically complex\" location than New Zealand, so he chose to set this sequence in Kashmir.In August 2017, Cruise injured his right leg on the London set during filming. Following the accident, the studio announced it would halt production for at least nine weeks in order for Cruise\\'s broken ankle and other injuries to heal, but released a statement saying that they would be keeping the July 2018 release date for the film. The injury resulted in a cost of around $80 million for the studio, because they had to pay the cast and crew for the eight-week hiatus so they would not take another job. However, the injury and subsequent costs were offset by insurance, and did not count against the film\\'s final budget. Filming resumed in early October 2017, with Cruise spotted on the set seven weeks after his initial injury, and two weeks earlier than initially planned.Reshoots for Cavill\\'s Justice League coincided with the schedule for Fallout, for which he had grown a mustache which he was contracted to keep while filming. While McQuarrie initially gave the producers of Justice League permission to have Cavill shave the mustache in exchange for the $3 million it would cost to shut down production on Fallout and then digitally fill the mustache in, executives from Paramount rejected the idea, forcing Justice League\\'s VFX team to use special effects to digitally remove the mustache in post-production.On January 25, 2018, the title was revealed to be Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Filming wrapped in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on March 25, 2018. Production in the UAE included filming of a High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) jump scene with Cruise. The scene required Cruise and the crew to train on a ground-based vertical wind tunnel, and then use a C-17 military aircraft to make over one hundred jumps from around 25,000 feet (7,600 m) to end up with three takes that McQuarrie wanted for the film. As the scene was to be set near sunset, they could only make one jump a day to try to get each shot. One of the biggest challenges for the visual effects team was replacing the Abu Dhabi desert with Paris, which is where the jump takes place in the film. Artists re-created the Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées using reference imagery, Lidar scans, and photogrammetry from drone footage that was taken above the building.\\n\\nVisual effects\\nThe visual effects were provided by DNEG and Blind LTD and supervised by Huw Evans, Andrew Booth and Jody Johnson with the help of One of Us and The Third Floor.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe musical score for Mission: Impossible – Fallout was composed by Lorne Balfe. Balfe was confirmed by McQuarrie to be the composer for the film in April 2018, replacing the previous composer Joe Kraemer.The score has been praised by many critics, calling it an epic and inspiring score, with some powerful themes which are balanced with softer more sentimental themes; some also considered it being too \"Nolan-esque\", comparing it to scores by Hans Zimmer (particularly The Dark Knight Rises). The score implements the use of percussion, snares, and bongos to create a jaunty staccato momentum.\\nThe digital album was released through Paramount Music on July 14, 2018. The physical soundtrack was released later in the month by La-La Land Records.\\n\\nAll music is composed by Lorne Balfe.\\n\\nRelease\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout was released in the United States and Canada on July 27, 2018, by Paramount in RealD 3D, IMAX, and IMAX 3D, and August 31, 2018 in China. The film premiered in Paris on July 12, 2018.The first trailer was released on February 4, 2018, during Super Bowl LII, and a second one on May 16, 2018. Marketing spent a total of $140 million on global promotion and advertisements. The film was released in India with some edits to exclude any mention of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.\\n\\nHome media\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout was released for digital download on November 20, 2018 and was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 4, 2018. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, a deleted scenes montage, an isolated score, and three commentary tracks.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout grossed $220.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $571 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $791.1 million, against a production budget of $178 million, becoming Mission: Impossible\\'s highest-grossing film.In the United States and Canada, Fallout was released alongside Teen Titans Go! To the Movies, and was projected to gross $48–65 million in its opening weekend, with some estimates going as high as $75 million. It opened in 4,386 theaters, the most ever for the franchise and the seventh-widest release all time.

It made $35 million in its second weekend to remain in first, and marked the best sophomore frame of the franchise. The film made $20 million in its third weekend, finishing second behind newcomer The Meg.In other territories, the film was projected to debut to $75–80 million from 36 countries, for an estimated total global opening of around $135 million. It made $15 million on its first day, including $2.8 million in South Korea. The film ended up overperforming, debuting to $92 million overseas for a worldwide total of $153.5 million.

The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Fast, sleek, and fun, Mission: Impossible – Fallout lives up to the \\'impossible\\' part of its name by setting yet another high mark for insane set pieces in a franchise full of them.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 84% overall positive score and a 65% \"definite recommend,\" while CinemaScore reported filmgoers gave it an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the highest ever for the series.Variety\\'s Peter Debruge called the film \"the series\\' most exciting installment yet,\" saying, \"McQuarrie clearly believes in creating coherent set pieces: His combat scenes are tense, muscular, and clean, shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense.\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a grade of \"A\" and called it one of the best action films ever, writing \"He\\'s only Tom Cruise because nobody else is willing to be—or maybe he\\'s only Tom Cruise so that nobody else has to be. Either way, Fallout is the film he\\'s always promised us, and it is worth the wait.\" Entertainment Weekly\\'s Chris Nashawaty also gave the film an \"A\" grade, commenting on Cruise that \"He\\'s still Hollywood\\'s hungriest movie star\", with the series getting \"better, twistier and more deliriously fun with each installment\". George Simpson of The Express complimented \"the action is brutal and gut-punching, the pacing heart-pumping and the stakes so high it\\'s gasp-inducing at times,\" adding, \"Fallout is an improvement on all the previous films\\' failings, drawing together all the best aspects of them; simultaneously giving off that classic vibe of the original while never being afraid to continually evolve;\" he gave the film five out of five stars. The Telegraph\\'s Tim Robey summed up the film as \"spectacular and eye-popping,\" deeming it \"the blockbuster of the summer\" with \"a pleasingly sinuous plot,\" and calling the film and its series a \"Bond-like franchise\"; he also rated the film five out of five stars.Robert Abele of TheWrap described Cruise as an \"evergreen movie star with the daredevil heart of a stuntman\" and that he \"puts every ounce of effort he can into the long, hard work of maintaining a blockbuster franchise.\" The Hollywood Reporter\\'s Todd McCarthy praised director Christopher McQuarrie, saying that with Mission: Impossible – Fallout he \"tops what he did with Cruise three years ago,\" and also singled out Vanessa Kirby for playing her character with \"a mix of elegance and frisky abandon.\" J.R. Kinnard of PopMatters wrote, \"Though it lacks the gritty humanity of something like George Miller\\'s Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Mission: Impossible – Fallout is no less impressive in its dedication to character-driven action and practical special effects. It\\'s a dazzling, non-stop thriller that\\'s sure to become an instant action classic.\" Screen Daily\\'s Tim Grierson wrote \"Tom Cruise is on fighting form in this thrilling franchise topper... [he is] ageless, riveting and seemingly unstoppable,\" further adding that \"the sixth film in the series is among the most outstanding, delivering a near-exhausting amount of stupendous action sequences paired with deft character drama and the requisite life-or-death stakes.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"there isn\\'t as much [humor] in the dialogue as before,\" but added, \"Crashes and petrolhead spills are what this franchise is reasonably expected to deliver. And this is what it cheerfully does.\"Sight & Sound\\'s Nick Pinkerton wrote \"A strong contender for the most consistently cinematic franchise of the last 25 years, the Mission: Impossible films also offer a case study in the idea of the actor as auteur, with Tom Cruise continuing to present himself as a fearless screen immortal in Fallout.\"The film was listed in 53 critics Top 10 films of 2018.\\n\\nAccolades\\nSequels\\nIt was announced by Cruise on January 14, 2019 that the seventh and eighth Mission: Impossible films will be shot back-to-back with McQuarrie writing and directing both films for November 19, 2021 and November 4, 2022 release.

In February 2020, McQuarrie announced that Henry Czerny will be returning as Eugene Kittridge in both sequels. In June 2020, it was announced that filming for the seventh installment had been delayed, and would take place in September, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nMission: Impossible – Fallout at IMDb',\n",
              " 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol': 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is a 2011 American action spy film directed by Brad Bird and written by Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec. It is the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series, and also Bird\\'s first live-action film. It stars Tom Cruise, who reprises his role of Impossible Missions Force agent Ethan Hunt, alongside Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, Michael Nyqvist, Anil Kapoor and Léa Seydoux. In the film, Hunt and his team race against time to find a nuclear extremist who gains access to Russian nuclear launch codes when a mission by Hunt\\'s team goes wrong, resulting in the bombing of Kremlin. The IMF is implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to enact \"Ghost Protocol\", disavowing the organization, leaving Hunt and his team without back up. Ghost Protocol was produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams, (the third film\\'s director) and Bryan Burk. It saw the return of editor Paul Hirsch and visual effects supervisor John Knoll from the first film, and is also the first Mission: Impossible film to be partially filmed using IMAX cameras.\\nReleased in the United States by Paramount Pictures on December 16, 2011, the film went on to become the highest-grossing film in the series, with $694 million, until it was surpassed by Mission: Impossible – Fallout. It is the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2011 as well as the second-highest-grossing film starring Cruise. It was followed by Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which was released in July 2015. The film received positive reviews on Metacritic, and Rotten Tomatoes calls it \"popcorn entertainment that really works\".\\n\\nPlot\\nIMF agent Trevor Hanaway is killed in Budapest by assassin Sabine Moreau, who takes his file containing Russian nuclear launch codes so she can give them to a man known only as \"Cobalt\".\\nIMF agent Ethan Hunt has purposely become incarcerated in a Moscow prison to acquire Bogdan, a source of information on Cobalt. With the help of Jane Carter, Hanaway\\'s handler, and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn, Hunt and Bogdan make their escape. IMF tasks Hunt to infiltrate the Kremlin to gain more information on Cobalt. During the mission, an insider broadcasts the IMF team about a supposed detonation, thereby alerting the Kremlin Police. Hunt\\'s team aborts the mission just as a bomb destroys much of the Kremlin. Carter and Dunn escape, but Hunt is captured by SVR agent Anatoly Sidorov and charged with destroying the Kremlin.\\nHunt escapes and meets with the IMF Secretary in Moscow on other business. The Secretary tells Hunt that the President had initiated \"Ghost Protocol\", disavowing IMF, but secretly orders Hunt to continue to pursue Cobalt. Sidorov\\'s forces catch up to Hunt, and the Secretary is killed. Hunt escapes along with the Secretary\\'s aide and intelligence analyst William Brandt. Brandt is able to identify Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a Swedish-born Russian nuclear strategist, who seeks to start a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia. Hendricks used the Kremlin bombing to cover up his theft of a Russian launch-control device, and now is planning a trade with Moreau at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai to gain the required launch codes.\\nThe team travels to Dubai. On the 119th floor of the hotel, they create deceptions using their various gadgetry and disguises to make Moreau believe she is meeting with Hendricks, and vice versa, when in fact they are interacting with the IMF team. Moreau discovers the deception, and in the ensuing chaos, Hendricks manages to escape with the launch codes, evading Hunt\\'s pursuit in the midst of a dust storm. As Moreau tries to escape, she is knocked out of a window by Carter and falls to her death. Brandt accuses Carter of doing this as retribution for Moreau\\'s murder of Hanaway, thus compromising the mission, but Hunt recognizes that Brandt has also been keeping secrets from them, having shown combat skills atypical of a mere analyst. Hunt leaves to meet with Bogdan to get more information on Hendricks, while Brandt tells the others that he had been assigned to secretly protect Ethan and his wife Julia in Croatia. Julia had been killed by a hit squad and Brandt feels responsible for Ethan\\'s loss, which is why he stopped being a field agent.\\nBogdan directs Ethan towards Mumbai, where Hendricks is set to negotiate with Indian billionaire entrepreneur Brij Nath to gain control of an obsolete Soviet military satellite. The IMF team splits up to stop Hendricks; Carter sexually seduces Nath to get the satellite override code, while Hunt, Brandt and Dunn try to stop Hendricks from using Nath\\'s broadcast station. They are too late as Hendricks has sent the launch codes to a Russian Delta III-class nuclear submarine to fire a single missile at San Francisco and disabled the station\\'s computer systems. Brandt and Dunn race to get the systems back online to send the override code, while Hunt pursues Hendricks, eventually having a brutal brawl with him face to face in an automated car park. Hendricks, with the launch device, jumps to his death moments before the missile is set to land. Hunt then uses one of the cars and takes a dangerous fall to use the device; he barely disables the missile before it strikes. Sidorov, who has followed IMF from Dubai to Mumbai, arrives and realizes that the IMF is innocent of the Kremlin bombing.\\nThe team meets in Seattle after Ethan accepts a new mission from Luther Stickell. Brandt confesses to Ethan about his failure to protect Julia. Ethan, however, reveals that her \"death\" and the murder of the Serbians were part of a plot to give her a new identity and enable Ethan to infiltrate the prison. A relieved Brandt happily accepts his mission, and becomes an agent once again. Meanwhile, Julia arrives at the harbor. Ethan and Julia gaze at each other, smiling, from afar before Ethan departs for his next mission.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDespite Mission: Impossible III earning less than its predecessors at the box office, its critical reception was much better than the second film and Paramount Pictures was keen on developing a fourth in the series. In August 2009, Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec were hired to write the film\\'s screenplay. Because of other commitments, J. J. Abrams said that it was unlikely for him to return as director but made note that he will produce the film alongside Tom Cruise. By March 2010, director Brad Bird was in talks of directing the film with Cruise returning to star as Ethan Hunt.The film was originally announced with a working name of Mission: Impossible 4 and code-named \"Aries\" during early production. By August 2010, title considerations did not include the Mission: Impossible 4 name, and thought was given to omitting the specific term \"Mission: Impossible\", which Variety compared to Christopher Nolan\\'s Batman sequel film The Dark Knight. In late October 2010, the title was confirmed as Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.\\nChristopher McQuarrie (who later directed Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Fallout) did an uncredited rewrite of the screenplay, explaining that: On Ghost Protocol I came in on the middle of the shoot to do a rewrite of the screenplay, though they had already started the movie. I had to communicate with the entire staff to determine what I could and couldn\\'t change, what sets had been built or struck, what scenes I could or couldn\\'t reshoot. I learned so much about production being right there. ... The script had these fantastic sequences in it but there was a mystery in it that was very complicated. What I did was about clarity. The mystery had to be made simpler. It\\'s like reaching into a sock and pulling it inside out. It\\'s still a sock, still all the same pieces, but all put together in a different order.\\n\\nFilming\\nThe film was partially shot with IMAX cameras, which made up approximately 30 minutes of the film\\'s run time. Bird insisted that certain scenes of the film be shot in IMAX, as opposed to 3D, as he felt that the IMAX format offered the viewer more immersion due to its brighter, higher quality image, which is projected on a larger screen, without the need for specialised glasses. Bird also believed that the IMAX format would bring back \"a level of showmanship\" to the presentation of Hollywood films, which he believes the industry has lost due to its emphasis on screening films in multiplexes as opposed to grand theaters, and vetoing \"first runs\" in favor of wider initial releases.\\nPrincipal photography took place from October 2010 to March 19, 2011. Filming took place in Budapest, Mumbai, Prague, Moscow, Vancouver, Bangalore, Chennai, and Dubai. Although Cruise appears to be free solo climbing in the film with the help of special gloves, in reality, he was securely attached to the Burj Khalifa at all times by multiple cables. Industrial Light & Magic digitally erased the cables in post-production. Following Cruise\\'s example, Patton and Seydoux also chose to forgo the use of stunt doubles for their fight scene at the Burj Khalifa where Carter exacts her revenge upon Moreau for Hanaway\\'s death.Many of the film\\'s interior scenes were shot at Vancouver\\'s Canadian Motion Picture Park Studios, including a key transition scene in a specially equipped IMF train car and the fight between Hunt and Hendricks in a Mumbai automated multi-level parking garage (which was constructed over a six-month period just for the film). The Vancouver Convention Centre was modified to double as downtown Bangalore. The film\\'s opening Moscow prison escape scenes were shot on location in a real former prison near Prague.Bird, having directed several Disney and Pixar films and short films, incorporated the trademark \"A113\" into the film on two separate occasions. The first is the design print on Hanaway\\'s ring during the flashback sequence, and the second being when Hunt calls in for support and uses the drop callsign, Alpha 1–1–3.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe musical score for Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol was composed by Michael Giacchino, who also composed the music for the third film and collaborated with Bird on The Incredibles and Ratatouille. As in previous installments, the score incorporates Lalo Schifrin\\'s themes from the original television series. \"Lalo is an amazing jazz writer. You know you can\\'t write a straight-up jazz score for a film like this but you can certainly hint at it here and there,\" said Giacchino, explaining the stylistic influence generated by Schifrin\\'s history with the franchise. A soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande on January 10, 2012.\\nAll music is composed by Michael Giacchino.\\n\\nDistribution\\nMarketing\\nIn July 2011, a teaser trailer for Ghost Protocol was released illustrating new shots from the film, one of which being Tom Cruise scaling the world\\'s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Moreover, prior to its release, the studio presented IMAX footage of the film to an invitation-only crowd of opinion makers and journalists at central London\\'s BFI IMAX theater. One of the many scenes that were included was a chase scene in a Dubai desert sandstorm.During November 2011, the Paramount released a Facebook game of the film in order to promote it. The new game allowed players to choose the roles of IMF agents and assemble teams to embark on a multiplayer journey. Players were also able to garner tickets to the film\\'s U.S. premiere and a hometown screening of the film for 30 friends.\\n\\nTheatrical release\\nFollowing the world premiere in Dubai on December 7, 2011, the film was released in IMAX and other large-format theaters in the U.S. on December 16, 2011, with general release on December 21, 2011.\\n\\nHome media\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital download on April 17, 2012. The home media releases, however, do not preserve the original IMAX imagery, and its aspect ratio is consistently cropped to 2.40:1 rather than switching to a 1.78:1 aspect ratio during the IMAX scenes. Blu-ray Disc releases such as The Dark Knight, Tron: Legacy, and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will switch between 2.40:1 for regular scenes and 1.78:1 for IMAX scenes. The film was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on June 26, 2018.\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 239 reviews and an average rating of 7.7/10. The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes reads: \"Stylish, fast-paced, and loaded with gripping set pieces, the fourth Mission: Impossible is big-budget popcorn entertainment that really works.\". Metacritic assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100 based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of four stars, saying the film \"is a terrific thriller with action sequences that function as a kind of action poetry.\" Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger wrote \"The eye-candy—from high-tech gadgets to gorgeous people—has only been ratcheted up. And so has the excitement.\" He also gave the film 3.5 out of four stars. Giving the film three out of four stars, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said \"In its way, the movie has old-Hollywood elegance. The scope and sets are vast, tall, and cavernous, but Bird scales down for spatial intimacy.\"Philippa Hawker of The Sydney Morning Herald gave the film three stars out of five and said it is \"ludicrously improbable, but also quite fun.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly opined that the movie \"brims with scenes that are exciting and amazing at the same time; they\\'re brought off with such casual aplomb that they\\'re funny, too. ... Ghost Protocol is fast and explosive, but it\\'s also a supremely clever sleight-of-hand thriller. Brad Bird, the animation wizard, ... showing an animator\\'s miraculously precise use of visual space, has a playful, screw-tightening ingenuity all his own.\" Roger Moore of The Charlotte Observer gave the film three out of four stars; said \"Brad Bird passes his audition for a career as a live-action director. And Ghost Protocol more than makes its bones as an argument for why Tom Cruise should continue in this role as long as his knees, and his nerves, hold up.\"IndieWire ranked it as one of the best action movies of the 21st century.\\n\\nBox office\\nGhost Protocol grossed $209.4 million in North America and $485.3 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $694.7 million. It is the second-highest-grossing film worldwide in the Mission: Impossible series, and the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2011. It is also the second-highest-grossing film worldwide starring Cruise, surpassing War of the Worlds from the top spot. It was the franchise\\'s highest-grossing film and Cruise\\'s biggest film at the time of release, before being surpassed by Mission: Impossible – Fallout seven years later.\\nIn limited release at 425 locations in North America, it earned $12.8 million over its opening weekend. After five days of limited release, it expanded to 3,448 theaters on its sixth day and reached #1 at the box office with $8.92 million. The film reached the top stop at the box office in its second and third weekends with $29.6 million and $29.4 million, respectively. Though only 9% of the film\\'s screenings were in IMAX theaters, they accounted for 23% of the film\\'s box office.Outside North America, it debuted to a $69.5 million in 42 markets representing approximately 70% of the marketplace. In the United Arab Emirates, it set an opening-weekend record of $2.4 million (since surpassed by Marvel\\'s The Avengers). In two countries outside the U.S. in which filming took place, its opening weekend gross increased by multiples over the previous installment: in Russia, more than doubling, to $6.08 million and in India, more than quadrupling, to $4.0 million. It is the second-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film outside North America. It topped the box office outside North America for three consecutive weekends (during December 2011) and five weekends in total (the other two in 2012). Its highest-grossing markets after North America are China ($102.5 million), Japan ($69.7 million), and South Korea ($51.1 million).\\n\\nAccolades\\nSequel\\nIn December 2011, Pegg suggested that he and Cruise were interested in returning for a fifth Mission: Impossible film. Paramount was also reportedly interested in fast-tracking a fifth film due to the fourth film\\'s success. Bird had stated that he probably would not return to direct a fifth film, but Tom Cruise had been confirmed to return. It was revealed in August 2013 that Christopher McQuarrie would be the director of Mission: Impossible 5. Principal photography began in February 2014 in London. Paramount Pictures released the film on July 31, 2015. The plot centers around Hunt\\'s IMF team in conflict with \"the Syndicate\", an international criminal organization first mentioned at the end of Ghost Protocol.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at IMDb\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at AllMovie\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at Metacritic\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at Box Office Mojo\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at Rotten Tomatoes\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at the TCM Movie Database\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol at the American Film Institute Catalog',\n",
              " 'Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation': 'Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation is a 2015 American action spy film written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, from a story by McQuarrie and Drew Pearce and the fifth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. The film stars Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, Sean Harris, Simon McBurney, and Tom Hollander, with Cruise, Renner, Pegg, and Rhames reprising their roles from previous films. Rogue Nation is produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams, and David Ellison of Skydance Productions. In the film, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is on the run from the CIA, following the IMF\\'s dissolution as he tries to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a mysterious global freelance terrorist group composed of many former intelligence officers from many different countries.\\nFilming began on August 21, 2014, in Vienna, Austria, and concluded on March 12, 2015. The film was released in North America by Paramount Pictures on July 31, 2015. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed $682 million worldwide, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2015 as well as the third-highest-grossing film starring Cruise.\\nA sequel, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, was released on July 27, 2018 with McQuarrie returning as writer and director.\\n\\nPlot\\nAfter intercepting nerve gas being sold to Chechen terrorists in Minsk, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is determined to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a consortium of rogue field operatives for various different intelligence agencies turned mercenaries the CIA does not believe exists. As CIA Director Alan Hunley successfully convinces a Senate committee to disband and absorb the IMF, currently without a secretary in charge, into the CIA for its destructive methods and other misconduct, Hunt is captured by the Syndicate at a record shop in London, while their leader, a blond man in glasses, kills the female IMF agent stationed there. Hunt escapes a torture chamber led by Syndicate member Janik \"Bone Doctor\" Vinter with the help of disavowed MI6 agent and now Syndicate operative Ilsa Faust. IMF Field Operations Director William Brandt, knowing Hunley will try to capture Hunt, warns him to stay undercover. Cut off from the IMF, Hunt follows his only lead: the man in glasses, later identified as former MI6 agent Solomon Lane.\\nSix months later, Hunt, still a fugitive living in Paris (luring a CIA team to a decoy safe house in Havana), enlists former colleague Benji Dunn to attend the opera Turandot in the Vienna state theater, predicting that an assassination attempt will be made on the Austrian Chancellor at the performance, and that Lane will also be there. The two stop three snipers, including Faust, but the Chancellor is ultimately killed by a car bomb, and Lane is still not found. Faust willingly drops hints of Lane\\'s plan to Hunt before leaving. After learning the Syndicate is working against \"the old world order\" by committing several terrorist acts, Dunn stays with Hunt instead of reporting back to the CIA, despite knowing his action amounts to treason.\\nHunt, blamed for the Chancellor\\'s death, is pursued by the CIA\\'s Special Activities Division. Brandt contacts Luther Stickell to find Hunt before the CIA does. Stickell tracks Hunt, Dunn, and Faust to Casablanca, where the trio break into and acquire a secret Syndicate file from a secure building. Faust flees with the data, evading both Hunt and Syndicate members, although Hunt kills the pursuing agents. Dunn reveals he copied the data onto a second USB drive, as Stickell and Brandt catch up to them.\\nFaust returns to London and attempts to use the file to quit her mission to infiltrate the Syndicate, but her MI6 handler, Atlee, compels her to continue, whilst discreetly wiping her drive. Meanwhile, Hunt learns that the data is an encrypted British government red box that requires the Prime Minister\\'s biometrics to unlock it. They reach London to confront Faust, where Lane\\'s men abduct Dunn, and use Dunn and Faust to blackmail Hunt into decrypting and delivering the data to them. Despite Brandt\\'s protests, Hunt agrees to do so.\\nAs part of Hunt\\'s plan, Brandt reveals their location to Hunley. During a charity auction in Blenheim Palace near Oxford, Hunley, Brandt, and Atlee take the PM to a secure room for the ostensible purpose of protecting him from Hunt. The PM confirms that the Syndicate was a project proposed by Atlee to perform missions without oversight, which would effectively make the PM \"judge, jury and executioner with zero accountability\"; however, the PM adds that he unequivocally rejected the proposal. Atlee then reveals himself as Hunt in a mask and secures the PM\\'s biometrics, allowing Stickell to decrypt the file. When the real Atlee arrives, Hunt forces him to admit that he began the Syndicate without permission and that he has been covering up its existence after Lane hijacked the project and went rogue, turning the Syndicate against him and MI6. Upon discovering the file contains access to £2.4 billion in various bank accounts, serving as the Syndicate\\'s would-be operating budget, Hunt destroys the data.\\nAt his meeting with Lane outside the Tower of London, Hunt tells Lane he has memorized the data and offers himself in exchange for Dunn and Faust. Dunn escapes after the bomb on him is disarmed, while Hunt and Faust are chased through the Tower of London complex by Lane\\'s men. Faust kills Vinter in a knife fight, while Hunt confronts Lane and lures him into a sealed, bulletproof glass cell where he is gassed unconscious and taken into custody. Having witnessed an IMF operation\\'s success firsthand, Hunley later returns with Brandt to the Senate committee and covers for Hunt and his team, convincing the committee to restore the IMF. After the meeting, Brandt congratulates Hunley, who is now the new IMF Secretary.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent\\nSimon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent\\nJeremy Renner as William Brandt, an IMF Field Operations Director\\nRebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, an MI6 agent undercover in the Syndicate\\nVing Rhames as Luther Stickell, an IMF agent, computer specialist and Ethan\\'s closest friend and ally\\nSean Harris as Solomon Lane, a former MI6 agent who went rogue and became the supreme leader of the Syndicate\\nSimon McBurney as Atlee, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service\\nZhang Jingchu as Lauren, a CIA analyst\\nTom Hollander as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\\nJens Hultén as Janik Vinter, a former KGB operative and Lane\\'s second-in-command\\nAlec Baldwin as Alan Hunley, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency\\n\\nProduction\\nPre-production\\nParamount Pictures announced in August 2013 that Christopher McQuarrie would direct the fifth Mission: Impossible film, from a script by Drew Pearce, with Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt. TC Productions and Bad Robot would produce, and Skydance Productions, who served as co-financers and executive producers of the latest installment, will work closely with the team in the development and production process.\" On November 14, 2013, Paramount announced a release date of December 25, 2015. The same month, Simon Pegg confirmed he would reprise his role as Benji. In May 2014, Will Staples replaced Pearce as screenwriter. Also that month, Jeremy Renner confirmed he was returning in the role of William Brandt, and Cruise said the film would shoot in London, with a later report saying it would first shoot in Vienna in August. At some point, McQuarrie replaced Staples as screenwriter; the final credits list McQuarrie as screenwriter, with story by Pearce.\\nIn July 2014, Rebecca Ferguson was cast and Alec Baldwin was in talks for the film. Baldwin was confirmed to have joined the cast in August 2014, and Ving Rhames was confirmed to be reprising his role of Luther Stickell. On September 5, it was announced that Sean Harris was in negotiations for the villain role. On October 2, Simon McBurney joined the cast of the film. On October 6, Chinese actress Zhang Jingchu joined the film\\'s cast (she only appears for 30 seconds in the finished film). On March 22, 2015, Paramount revealed the film\\'s official title, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, along with a teaser poster and trailer.\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography began in August 2014. On August 21, the production released its first photos from the set in Vienna, Austria. In August actors Cruise and Pegg, along with director Christopher McQuarrie, were in Vienna, at the Metro and on the roof-top of Vienna State Opera. After finishing one-and-a-half weeks of filming in Austria, on August 30, Cruise arrived in the Moroccan capital city of Rabat for filming more scenes. Here the Marrakesh Highway was closed for fourteen days (August 30–September 12). Other filming locations in Morocco include Agadir, Rabat and Casablanca. On September 8 and 9, filming took place in the Marrakesh Stadium, which was closed both days for filming purposes, and Kasbah of the Udayas, in Rabat.After more than a month of shooting in Austria and Morocco, filming moved to London on September 28. Filming of an action scene featuring Ethan Hunt climbing and hanging on the outside of a flying Airbus A400M Atlas took place at RAF Wittering near Stamford. Tom Cruise performed the sequence, at times suspended on the aircraft over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) in the air, without the use of a stunt double. To pull off this particular stunt, the production team were given a limited period of only 48 hours. The plane took off and landed 8 times before they had the perfect shot. On November 9, filming began on Southampton Water, and Fawley Power Station. Tom Cruise trained under diving specialist Kirk Krack to be able to hold his breath for three minutes to perform an underwater sequence which was filmed in a single long take without any edits (though the scene in the movie was cut with several breaks, giving the impression for the scene having several takes). However, stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood claims that Cruise held his breath for just over six minutes.On February 20, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter said filming was halted to give McQuarrie, Cruise, and an unknown third person time to rework the film\\'s ending. Filming ended on March 12, 2015.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe musical score for Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation was composed by Joe Kraemer, who previously collaborated with director McQuarrie on The Way of the Gun and Jack Reacher. Kraemer was announced as the composer for the film in September 2014. The soundtrack was recorded with small orchestral sections at British Grove Studios and with full orchestra at Abbey Road Studios.As well as incorporating Lalo Schifrin\\'s thematic material from the television series throughout the score, three tracks (\"Escape to Danger\", \"A Matter of Going\", and \"Finale and Curtain Call\") interpolate Puccini\\'s Nessun dorma aria from his opera Turandot, featured in the opera house scene.\\nThe physical soundtrack became available from La-La Land Records on July 28, 2015, with the digital album released from Paramount Music on the same day.\\n\\nAll music is composed by Joe Kraemer.\\n\\nRelease\\nParamount had originally scheduled the film for a December 25, 2015 release. On January 26, 2015, Paramount advanced the release date to July 31, 2015. The main reason cited by The Hollywood Reporter was to avoid competition with two other 2015 films, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Spectre. In the United States and Canada, it was released in the Dolby Vision format in Dolby Cinema, the first-ever time for Paramount. On February 13, 2015, Paramount and IMAX Corporation announced that they would digitally remaster the film into the IMAX format and release it in IMAX theaters worldwide on the scheduled date. The film was completed at 2:00AM on July 18, 2015, less than two weeks before its release date. The film was officially released in North America on July 31, 2015. Lotte released the film in South Korea on July 30, 2015. The film was released in China on September 8, 2015.In August 2015, Fox Networks acquired the US cable broadcast rights, for broadcast after its theatrical release. The film is available for FX Networks and its suite of networks: FX, FXX, FXM, as well as the video-on-demand platform FXNow.\\n\\nMarketing\\nParamount Pictures spent $42 million on advertising for the film.A comic book was released in conjunction with the film\\'s DVD/Blu-ray release. It follows Hunt going rogue during the events of the film. The comic is written by the film\\'s writer and director Christopher McQuarrie and illustrated by Lazarus artist Owen Freeman.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nMission: Impossible – Rogue Nation grossed $195 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $487.7 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $682.7 million. Although Rogue Nation was projected to become the highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film and the biggest movie for Cruise, it apparently fell short of eclipsing Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol\\'s final gross to become the third-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film and the third-biggest film for Cruise. It had a worldwide opening of $121 million and an IMAX worldwide opening total of $12.5 million (the third-biggest of July behind The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)). Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $108.9 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.\\n\\nUnited States and Canada\\nIn the United States and Canada, according to pre-release tracking, the film was projected to earn around $40–50 million in its opening weekend, less than what the first three Mission: Impossible films earned in their initial weekend. It made $4 million from its Thursday night showings which began at 8 p.m. from 2,764 theaters, and $20.3 million on its opening day, which is the second-biggest opening day for Cruise (behind War of the Worlds) and the biggest in the Mission: Impossible franchise (breaking Mission: Impossible 2\\'s record), with 16% of ticket sales from the film\\'s 367 IMAX theaters. In its opening weekend the film grossed $55.5 million exceeding expectations and is the second-highest opening in the franchise, behind Mission: Impossible 2 ($57.8 million) and the third-biggest for Cruise behind War of the Worlds ($64.8 million) and Mission: Impossible 2. IMAX contributed $8.4 million of the total opening gross from 369 IMAX screens which is the third-best for a July opening after The Dark Knight Rises ($19 million) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 ($15.2 million). Premium large format grossed up $2.6 million, 13% of Friday\\'s gross with Cinemark XD grossing close to $700,000 at 108 screens. It remained at the top spot for the second weekend earning an estimated $28.5 million (down 48.7%) from 3,988 theaters (32+ theaters) buoyed by strong word of mouth, rapturous reviews and strong plays at IMAX theaters. Revenues from IMAX also dropped steadily by 39% to $4.3 million in its second weekend. It topped the North American box office for two consecutive weekends until surpassed by the music biographical drama Straight Outta Compton in its third weekend. It ended its theatrical run on October 29, 2015, playing in theaters for a total of 91 days, or 13 weeks, earning a total of $195 million at the North American box office which is just 28.6% of its total worldwide gross. It is the fourth-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film behind Mission: Impossible Fallout ($220 million) , Mission: Impossible 2 ($215 million) and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol ($209 million).\\n\\nOther countries\\nElsewhere, the film opened in 40 international markets including 135 IMAX theaters on July 31, 2015 in big markets such the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Australia. It grossed $64.5 million in its opening weekend and went No. 1 in 33 markets and IMAX contributed $4.1 million of its international opening. Revenues from its second weekend increased by 0.5% to $65 million. It added 18 new markets including India, Japan, and Russia and opened at No. 1 in 17 of the 18 markets with the exception of Japan where it was behind Jurassic World. Overall, it opened at No. 1 in 55 of the 63 territories it has been released in and had the biggest opening weekend ever for the franchise in 46 markets and Cruise\\'s best opening in 40 markets. It topped the box office outside of North America for three consecutive weekends before being overtaken by Paramount\\'s own Terminator Genisys in its fourth weekend and four in total.It had the biggest opening for the franchise in the UK, Ireland and Malta ($8.3 million), France ($7 million), India ($7.5 million), Japan ($6.1 million), Russia and the CIS ($5.3 million), Mexico ($5 million), the Middle East ($4.7; including $2.5 million from UAE alone), Taiwan ($5.1 million), Australia ($3.8 million), Germany ($3.2 million), Brazil ($3.1 million) and Pakistan ($1 million). In South Korea, where the franchise has been a hit it opened to $16.95 million (49% above Ghost Protocol), which is the second-biggest opening ever for Paramount, behind Transformers: Dark of the Moon; Cruise\\'s biggest-ever opening; the best for the Mission: Impossible franchise; and the second-biggest opening for a Western film of 2015. It added $8.1 and $3.7 million in its second and third weekend for a total of $41.1 million making South Korea the film\\'s second-highest market followed by Japan ($41.2 million), the United Kingdom ($32 million), France ($20.9 million), and Germany ($13 million). In Japan, it faced competition with the continued run of Jurassic World. In China, Rogue Nation emerged very successful and earned $18.5 million on its opening day of September 8 (including $1.4 million from midnight screenings), which is the country\\'s biggest opening for a Hollywood 2D film, the second-biggest for any 2D film in China (only behind the $22.2 million debut of local 2D film Pancake Man), and the fifth-biggest opening for any film. Despite opening on a Tuesday—during which most children are off to school—the film opened successfully and almost matched the opening figure of North America. Rob Cain of Forbes cited out possible reasons for the successful opening: the well-establishment of the franchise in China (its immediate predecessor Ghost Protocol earned $102.7 million), rapid expansion and growth of Chinese movie market, being the second Hollywood movie (after Terminator Genisys) to be released after the nearly 60-day blackout period in which non-Chinese movies were dabarred from going to general release in the country, and the successful awareness campaign and marketing efforts by the team including Tom Cruise visiting several Chinese cities. It went on to earn an estimated $85.8 million through its opening weekend (Tuesday–Sunday) from 5,500 screens. It is the highest-grossing 2D Hollywood film there with $136.8 million (breaking Interstellar\\'s record). Rogue Nation was projected to make roughly 70% of its worldwide gross abroad, and indeed ended up making $487,287,762 or 71.4% of its entire worldwide gross overseas which is the second highest among the series.\\n\\nCritical response\\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation has a rating of 94% based on 325 reviews and an average rating of 7.50/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation continues the franchise\\'s thrilling resurgence—and proves that Tom Cruise remains an action star without equal.\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 75 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called the film \"preposterously enjoyable\" and said that it \"unfolds with fluid, twisty, old-school pleasure,\" highlighting the performances of Cruise, Pegg, Ferguson, and Baldwin and comparing the action scenes to those of the James Bond films as well as Alfred Hitchcock\\'s The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). He ultimately gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Rogue Nation 3.5 out of 4 stars, highly praising the film\\'s cast and stating that the film \"keeps topping itself\". However, he criticized the villain for not being too memorable or intimidating. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said that McQuarrie\\'s direction allowed Rogue Nation to stand out among the other films in terms of action and its inclusion of female characters, singling out Ferguson\\'s Ilsa as uniquely empowered and action-oriented, also praising her scenes with Cruise. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic praised Cruise, saying \"You overcome the impossible through the application of sheer, unvarnished willpower, a quality that Cruise has always possessed in abundance\" and describing him as the driving force of the film and the franchise. He, too, praised Ferguson among the supporting cast for her role as an action heroine. Joseph Wigler of MTV.com considered the movie as \"one of the most entertaining Ethan Hunt adventures\" which proves that \"the franchise still has plenty of fight left in it, with no signs of slowing down.\" He praised the performances of Cruise and Ferguson, applauding the latter for playing \"the most fascinating character in the entire movie\" and \"one of the most complicated and alluring characters in the entire five film series.\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times stated \"Sleek and bloated, specific and generic, \\'Rogue Nation\\' is pretty much like most of the \\'Impossible\\' movies in that it\\'s an immense machine that Mr. McQuarrie, after tinkering and oiling, has cranked up again and set humming with twists and turns, global trotting and gadgets, a crack supporting cast and a hard-working star.\"A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club remarked, \"Rather than go full auteur on his formulaic material, McQuarrie instead offers a kind of greatest-hits package: \\'Rogue Nation\\' marries the shifting loyalties of Brian De Palma\\'s original to the kinetic action beats of John Woo\\'s series nadir and the all-set-piece structure of Brad Bird\\'s series zenith, adding an omnipotent villain not far removed from the one Philip Seymour Hoffman played in J.J. Abrams\\' entry. It\\'s the least visually or conceptually distinctive of the five movies, leaning on what\\'s worked before rather than forging its own path.\" Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, calling it \"breathlessly thrilling\" and giving high praise to its action sequences, saying \" all you can do is pick your jaw off your lap and grin at the breathtakingly bananas spectacle you\\'ve just witnessed.\" Meanwhile, David Edelstein of Vulture.com called Ferguson the \"best reason\" to see the film. However, he felt it did not surpass its predecessor and singled out several elements of some of the action sequences for criticism. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal also praised Ferguson but felt that she and Cruise had \"zero chemistry\" onscreen. Nonetheless, he praised the film for working \"ingenious changes on old tropes\". Daniel Krupa of IGN only gave the film a score of 7/10, praising the action sequences and the performances of the central cast but criticizing it for not adding enough to the series or expanding on the plot of Ghost Protocol.\\n\\nHome media\\nMission Impossible: Rogue Nation was released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 15, 2015 in the United States. A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray was released on June 26, 2018 along with the first four films.\\n\\nAccolades\\nSequel\\nBy May 2015, Paramount was developing a sixth Mission: Impossible film, with Cruise, Abrams, Ellison, and Goldberg returning to produce, along with Don Granger and Matt Grimm executive producing, and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development. Christopher McQuarrie returned to write and direct the film, which began filming April 2017 for a July 2018 release.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website\\nMission: Impossible – Rogue Nation at IMDb',\n",

              " 'Narc (film)': 'Narc is a 2002 American neo-noir crime thriller film written and directed by Joe Carnahan and starring Jason Patric and Ray Liotta. The plot revolves around the efforts of two police detectives in search of the murderer of an undercover police officer. As they investigate, they engage in unethical behavior and uncover dark secrets that will challenge their fragile relationship.\\n\\nPlot\\nUndercover narcotics officer Nick Tellis chases a drug dealer through the streets of Detroit. Tellis shoots and kills the dealer when he holds a child hostage, but a stray bullet hits the child\\'s pregnant mother, causing her to miscarry. Eighteen months later, Tellis is tasked with investigating the murder of an undercover officer, Michael Calvess. Tellis reluctantly agrees to take the case on two conditions: that he will get a desk job if he secures a conviction, and that he is partnered with Detective Henry Oak, whom Tellis has read about in the Calvess case file. The police chief accepts Tellis\\' conditions, but warns him about Oak\\'s instability.\\nDuring their first meeting, Oak reveals to Tellis his belief that the department wants the Calvess case buried and it is all about politics. The detectives visit the scene where a drug dealer has been shot dead in his bathtub, which Tellis surmises the death was accidental. Tellis notes that the shotgun at the scene is a SWAT weapon with the serial number filed off.\\nWhile the partners have a discussion about family, Oak recalls a drug bust decades prior, where he found a 10-year-old girl who was being sold into prostitution by her stepfather, resulting in Oak beating the man; he sees parallels with the current case. Tellis visits Calvess\\' widow Kathryn, and asks about her relationship with her husband while he was on the street. Oak, who is protective of Calvess\\' family, turns up at the house and angrily confronts Tellis.\\nThe detectives next visit the home of a man involved in Tellis\\' shooting. Although they find no evidence to suggest he murdered Calvess, they find another officer\\'s badge on the premises. The man pulls a gun and wounds Tellis before Oak kills him in self-defense. The case assailant is determined to be Calvess\\' killer and the case is closed. However, Tellis and Oak are furious as they believe the killer is yet to be found, and continue to investigate independently.\\nWhen the detectives visit an auto body shop, Oak attempts to force a confession out of a pair of suspects. Tellis is increasingly suspicious of Oak\\'s tactics. Oak finds police-issue guns in a car belonging to one of the suspects, including one that belonged to Calvess. He beats both men until Tellis tells him to get CSI tools from the car.\\nWhen Oak leaves the room, Tellis locks the door and asks for the truth from the suspects. They explain that Calvess, who had fallen into drug addiction, blew Tellis\\' cover eighteen months before and caused the shooting. On the day of the murder, Calvess tried to deal with the two dealers, but it went badly.\\nOak arrives, having trailed Calvess to confirm rumors that he was an addict. Calvess went for his weapon, which was the dealers\\' justification for attacking him. The two men ran off as Oak shot at them. Tellis confronts Oak and accuses him of murdering Calvess, which Oak denies. Tellis then raises the issue of Oaks\\' relationship with Calvess\\' wife Kathryn.\\nKathryn was the ten-year-old girl who was pimped out by her stepfather. Oak considers her the daughter he never had, and has remained close. He has been protecting her by covering crimes she committed in her teenage years. Tellis tells Oak he will make the arrest, and Oak beats him with the shotgun, and resumes brutalizing the dealers.\\nHe turns the tape recorder on and attempts to beat a confession out of the men, threatening to shoot them. Tellis breaks into their car, retrieves a gun, calls for back-up, and re-enters the building. He shoots Oak when Oak refuses to put his gun down. Tellis moves to aid Oak, and, realizing he\\'s dying, pleads for the truth of what happened the night Calvess died.\\nOak explains that Calvess shot at the dealers as they fled from Oak, leaving the shoulder wound. Oak argued with him, explaining that he had had enough of defending Calvess and would turn him in to the department. In despair, Calvess took his gun and shot himself. Oak had been protecting his name and family, so Calvess\\' wife could receive his pension. Oak\\'s motive was to convict the dealers who he felt made Mike a junkie. Oak dies in Tellis\\' arms, leaving the confession on tape, and Tellis with only moments to decide what to do with it.\\n\\nCast\\nReception\\nBox office\\nNarc opened in the U.S on December 17, 2002 in a limited release in 6 theaters and grossed $63,303 with an average of $10,550 per theater and ranking #45 at the box office. The film then had its wide release in 822 theaters and grossed $2,825,807 with an average of $3,437 per theater and ranking #12. The film ended up earning  $10,465,659 domestically and $2,168,088 internationally for a total of $12,633,747, doubling its $6.5 million production budget.\\n\\nCritical response\\nNarc received positive reviews from critics and has a \"Certified Fresh\" rating of 84% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 158 reviews with an average score of 7.13 out of 10. The consensus states \"Jason Patric and Ray Liotta are electrifying in this gritty, if a little too familiar, cop drama.\" The film also has a score of 70 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 34 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nNarc at IMDb\\nNarc at Rotten Tomatoes\\nNarc at Box Office Mojo\\nNarc at AllMovie',\n",

              " 'New York City': 'New York City (NYC), often called simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass. With almost 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of the world\\'s most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy.Situated on one of the world\\'s largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island—were created when local governments were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016. As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was subsequently renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since November 1674. New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790, and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace. In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship, and environmental sustainability, and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity. In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, including three of the world\\'s ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. A record 62.8 million tourists visited New York City in 2017. Times Square is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world\\'s busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world\\'s entertainment industry. Many of the city\\'s landmarks, skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. Manhattan\\'s real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Providing continuous 24/7 service and contributing to the nickname The City that Never Sleeps, the New York City Subway is the largest single-operator rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 rail stations. The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, New York University, Rockefeller University, and the City University of New York system, which is the largest urban public university system in the United States. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world\\'s leading financial center and the most financially powerful city in the world, and is home to the world\\'s two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.\\n\\nEtymology\\nIn 1664, the city was named in honor of the Duke of York, who would become King James II of England. James\\'s older brother, King Charles II, appointed the Duke proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, when England seized it from the Dutch.\\n\\nHistory\\nEarly history\\nIn the precolonial era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquian Native Americans, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including the areas that would later become the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.The first documented visit into New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano, a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown. He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoulême (New Angoulême). A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named Río de San Antonio (Saint Anthony\\'s River). The Padrón Real of 1527, the first scientific map to show the East Coast of North America continuously, was informed by Gomes\\' expedition and labeled the northeastern United States as Tierra de Esteban Gómez in his honor.In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company. He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange. Hudson\\'s first mate described the harbor as \"a very good Harbour for all windes\" and the river as \"a mile broad\" and \"full of fish\". Hudson sailed roughly 150 miles (240 km) north, past the site of the present-day New York State capital city of Albany, in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue. He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (New Netherland).\\nThe first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was Juan Rodriguez (transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues), a merchant from Santo Domingo. Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. Broadway, from 159th Street to 218th Street in Upper Manhattan, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.\\n\\nDutch rule\\nA permanent European presence near New York Harbor began in 1624—making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States —with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island. The colony of New Amsterdam was centered on what would later be known as Lower Manhattan. It extended from the lower tip of Manhattan to modern day Wall Street, where a 12-foot wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and British raids. In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band, for \"the value of 60 guilders\" (about $900 in 2018). A disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly. To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swaths of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639–1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000. Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however, he also earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups (including Quakers, Jews, and Lutherans) from establishing houses of worship. The Dutch West India Company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between Stuyvesant and residents of New Amsterdam.\\n\\nEnglish rule\\nIn 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel Richard Nicolls, without bloodshed. The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom. In 1667, during negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda after the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of what is now Suriname (on the northern South America coast) they had gained from the English; and in return, the English kept New Amsterdam. The fledgling settlement was promptly renamed \"New York\" after the Duke of York (the future King James II and IV), who would eventually be deposed in the Glorious Revolution. After the founding, the duke gave part of the colony to proprietors George Carteret and John Berkeley. Fort Orange, 150 miles (240 km) north on the Hudson River, was renamed Albany after James\\'s Scottish title. The transfer was confirmed in 1667 by the Treaty of Breda, which concluded the Second Anglo-Dutch War.On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Dutch captain Anthony Colve seized the colony of New York from the English at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it \"New Orange\" after William III, the Prince of Orange. The Dutch would soon return the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670. By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200. New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population to the disease in 1702 alone.\\n\\nProvince of New York\\nNew York grew in importance as a trading port while as a part of the colony of New York in the early 1700s. It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, the highest percentage outside Charleston, South Carolina. Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York\\'s economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the American South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial period.The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to establish the freedom of the press in North America. In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King\\'s College in Lower Manhattan.\\n\\nAmerican Revolution\\nThe Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty, organized in the city, skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there. The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within the modern-day borough of Brooklyn. After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made the city their military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces evacuated at the close of the war in 1783, they transported 3,000 freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia. They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean.\\n\\nThe only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York occurred, a large conflagration on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including Trinity Church.In 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. New York City as the U.S. capital hosted several events of national scope in 1789—the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time; and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all at Federal Hall on Wall Street. By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia to become the largest city in the United States, but by the end of that year, pursuant to the Residence Act, the national capital was moved to Philadelphia.\\n\\nNineteenth century\\nOver the course of the nineteenth century, New York City\\'s population grew from 60,000 to 3.43 million. Under New York State\\'s abolition act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties. Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-Black population gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential United States founders as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate Black children. It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free Blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School. New York city\\'s population jumped from 123,706 in 1820 to 312,710 by 1840, 16,000 of whom were Black.In the 19th century, the city was transformed by development relating to its status as a national and international trading center, as well as by European immigration. The city adopted the Commissioners\\' Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass almost all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes. Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants.Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Public-minded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.\\nThe Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants; more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, upwards of a quarter of the city\\'s population. There was also extensive immigration from the German provinces, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and Germans comprised another 25% of New York\\'s population by 1860.Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city\\'s ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called upon the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $6,229 in 2019) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.The draft riots deteriorated into attacks on New York\\'s elite, followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the New York Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants. At least 120 people were killed. Eleven Black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and New Jersey. The Black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865, which it had last been in 1820. The White working class had established dominance. Violence by longshoremen against Black men was especially fierce in the docks area. It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.\\n\\nModern history\\nIn 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens. The opening of the subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.In 1904, the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people on board. In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city\\'s worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies\\' Garment Workers\\' Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.New York\\'s non-white population was 36,620 in 1890. New York City was a prime destination in the early twentieth century for African Americans during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had become home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America. The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition. The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height and creating an identifiable skyline.\\nNew York became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early-1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in the early-1930s, becoming the first megacity in human history. The difficult years of the Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County as well as similar suburban areas in New Jersey. New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America\\'s place as the world\\'s dominant economic power. The United Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York\\'s global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York\\'s displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.\\n\\nThe Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights. Wayne R. Dynes, author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, wrote that drag queens were the only \"transgender folks around\" during the June 1969 Stonewall riots. \"None of them in fact made a major contribution to the movement.\" Others say the transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality during the period of the Stonewall riots and thereafter.In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates. While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city\\'s economic health in the 1980s, New York\\'s crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s. By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the city\\'s economy. New York\\'s population reached all-time highs in the 2000 census and then again in the 2010 census.\\n\\nNew York City suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Two of the four airliners highjacked that day were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, destroying them and killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers. The North Tower became the tallest building ever to be destroyed anywhere then or subsequently.The area was rebuilt with a new One World Trade Center, a 9/11 memorial and museum, and other new buildings and infrastructure. The World Trade Center PATH station, which had opened on July 19, 1909 as the Hudson Terminal, was also destroyed in the attacks. A temporary station was built and opened on November 23, 2003. An 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2) permanent rail station designed by Santiago Calatrava, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the city\\'s third-largest hub, was completed in 2016. The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and the sixth-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3 m) in reference to the year of U.S. independence.The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.In March 2020, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 for the city was in Manhattan. As of February 2021, New York City had recorded over 27,000 deaths from COVID-19-related complications. The city rapidly became the global epicenter of the pandemic during the early phase, before the infection became widespread across the world and the rest of the nation.\\n\\nGeography\\nDuring the Wisconsin glaciation, 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City area was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 2,000 feet (610 m) in depth. The erosive forward movement of the ice (and its subsequent retreat) contributed to the separation of what is now Long Island and Staten Island. That action also left bedrock at a relatively shallow depth, providing a solid foundation for most of Manhattan\\'s skyscrapers.New York City is situated in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston. The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island.\\nThe Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary. The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey. The East River—a tidal strait—flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely freshwater river in the city.The city\\'s land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out, especially in Manhattan.The city\\'s total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km2); 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km2) of the city is land and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km2) of this is water. The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level, is the highest point on the eastern seaboard south of Maine. The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.\\n\\nBoroughs\\nNew York City is sometimes referred to collectively as the Five Boroughs. There are hundreds of distinct neighborhoods throughout the boroughs, many with a definable history and character.\\nIf the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States (Staten Island would be ranked 37th as of 2020); these same boroughs are coterminous with the four most densely populated counties in the United States: New York (Manhattan), Kings (Brooklyn), Bronx, and Queens.\\n\\nManhattan\\nManhattan (New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough, is home to Central Park and most of the city\\'s skyscrapers, and is sometimes locally known as The City. Manhattan\\'s population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km2) in 2015 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city.Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial center of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations, the United Nations Headquarters, Wall Street, and a number of important universities. Manhattan is often described as the financial and cultural center of the world.Most of the borough is situated on Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the Hudson River. Several small islands also compose part of the borough of Manhattan, including Randall\\'s Island, Wards Island, and Roosevelt Island in the East River, and Governors Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor.\\nManhattan Island is loosely divided into the Lower, Midtown, and Uptown regions. Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, and above the park is Harlem. Harlem was predominantly occupied by Jewish and Italian Americans in the 19th century until the Great Migration. It was the center of the Harlem Renaissance.\\n\\nThe borough of Manhattan also includes a small neighborhood on the mainland, called Marble Hill, which is contiguous with the Bronx. New York City\\'s remaining four boroughs are collectively referred to as the Outer Boroughs.\\n\\nBrooklyn\\nBrooklyn (Kings County), on the western tip of Long Island, is the city\\'s most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. Downtown Brooklyn is the largest central core neighborhood in the Outer Boroughs. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the U.S. Marine Park and Prospect Park are the two largest parks in Brooklyn. Since 2010, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship and high technology startup firms, and of postmodern art and design.\\n\\nQueens\\nQueens (Queens County), on Long Island north and east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnically diverse county in the United States, and the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence. Downtown Flushing has become one of the busiest central core neighborhoods in the outer boroughs. Queens is the site of Citi Field, the baseball stadium of the New York Mets, and hosts the annual U.S. Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, are located in Queens. The third is Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey.\\n\\nThe Bronx\\nThe Bronx (Bronx County) is New York City\\'s northernmost borough and the only New York City borough that lies mainly on the mainland United States. It is the location of Yankee Stadium, the baseball park of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively owned housing complex in the United States, Co-op City. It is also home to the Bronx Zoo, the world\\'s largest metropolitan zoo, which spans 265 acres (1.07 km2) and houses more than 6,000 animals. The Bronx is also the birthplace of hip hop music and culture. Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City, at 2,772 acres (1,122 ha).\\n\\nStaten Island\\nStaten Island (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and to Manhattan by way of the free Staten Island Ferry, a daily commuter ferry which provides unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan. In central Staten Island, the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately 2,500 acres (10 km2), including 28 miles (45 km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city. Designated in 1984 to protect the island\\'s natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.\\n\\nArchitecture\\nNew York has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the Dutch Colonial Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn, the oldest section of which dates to 1656, to the modern One World Trade Center, the skyscraper at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan and the most expensive office tower in the world by construction cost.Manhattan\\'s skyline, with its many skyscrapers, is universally recognized, and the city has been home to several of the tallest buildings in the world. As of 2019, New York City had 6,455 high-rise buildings, the third most in the world after Hong Kong and Seoul. Of these, as of 2011, 550 completed structures were at least 330 feet (100 m) high, with more than fifty completed skyscrapers taller than 656 feet (200 m). These include the Woolworth Building, an early example of Gothic Revival architecture in skyscraper design, built with massively scaled Gothic detailing; completed in 1913, for 17 years it was the world\\'s tallest building.The 1916 Zoning Resolution required setbacks in new buildings and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below. The Art Deco style of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The buildings have distinctive ornamentation, such as the eagles at the corners of the 61st floor on the Chrysler Building, and are considered some of the finest examples of the Art Deco style. A highly influential example of the international style in the United States is the Seagram Building (1957), distinctive for its façade using visible bronze-toned I-beams to evoke the building\\'s structure. The Condé Nast Building (2000) is a prominent example of green design in American skyscrapers and has received an award from the American Institute of Architects and AIA New York State for its design.\\nThe character of New York\\'s large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930. In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In neighborhoods such as Riverdale (in the Bronx), Ditmas Park (in Brooklyn), and Douglaston (in Queens), large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian.Stone and brick became the city\\'s building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835. A distinctive feature of many of the city\\'s buildings is the roof-mounted wooden water tower. In the 1800s, the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations, which could break municipal water pipes. Garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, such as Jackson Heights.According to the United States Geological Survey, an updated analysis of seismic hazard in July 2014 revealed a \"slightly lower hazard for tall buildings\" in New York City than previously assessed. Scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near the city, which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city.\\n\\nClimate\\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, using the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm, New York City features a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), and is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization. The suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the transitional zone between humid subtropical and humid continental climates (Dfa). By the Trewartha classification, the city is defined as having an oceanic climate (Do). Annually, the city averages 234 days with at least some sunshine. The city lies in the USDA 7b plant hardiness zone.\\n\\nWinters are chilly and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow sea breezes offshore temper the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachian Mountains keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. The daily mean temperature in January, the area\\'s coldest month, is 32.6 °F (0.3 °C). Temperatures usually drop to 10 °F (−12 °C) several times per winter, yet can also reach 60 °F (16 °C) for several days even in the coldest winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from cool to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 76.5 °F (24.7 °C) in July.Nighttime temperatures are often enhanced due to the urban heat island effect. Daytime temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed 100 °F (38 °C), although this is a rare achievement, last occurring on July 23, 2011. Similarly, readings of 0 °F (−18 °C) are also extremely rare, last occurring on February 14, 2016. Extreme temperatures have ranged from −15 °F (−26 °C), recorded on February 9, 1934, up to 106 °F (41 °C) on July 9, 1936; the coldest recorded wind chill was −37 °F (−38 °C) on the same day as the all-time record low. The record cold daily maximum was 2 °F (−17 °C) on December 30, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum was 84 °F (29 °C), last recorded on July 22, 2011. The average water temperature of the nearby Atlantic Ocean ranges from 39.7 °F (4.3 °C) in February to 74.1 °F (23.4 °C) in August.The city receives 49.9 inches (1,270 mm) of precipitation annually, which is relatively evenly spread throughout the year. Average winter snowfall between 1981 and 2010 has been 25.8 inches (66 cm); this varies considerably between years. Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area. Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs. The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.The coldest month on record is January 1857, with a mean temperature of 19.6 °F (−6.9 °C) whereas the warmest months on record are July 1825 and July 1999, both with a mean temperature of 81.4 °F (27.4 °C). The warmest year on record is 2012, with a mean temperature of 57.4 °F (14.1 °C). The coldest year is 1836, with a mean temperature of 47.3 °F (8.5 °C). The driest month on record is June 1949, with 0.02 inches (0.51 mm) of rainfall. The wettest month was August 2011, with 18.95 inches (481 mm) of rainfall. The driest year on record is 1965, with 26.09 inches (663 mm) of rainfall. The wettest year was 1983, with 80.56 inches (2,046 mm) of rainfall. The snowiest month on record is February 2010, with 36.9 inches (94 cm) of snowfall. The snowiest season (Jul–Jun) on record is 1995–1996, with 75.6 inches (192 cm) of snowfall. The least snowy season was 1972–1973, with 2.3 inches (5.8 cm) of snowfall. The earliest seasonal trace of snowfall occurred on October 10, in both 1979 and 1925. The latest seasonal trace of snowfall occurred on May 9, in both 2020 and 1977.\\n\\nSee or edit raw graph data.\\n\\nParks\\nThe city of New York has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the National Park Service, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. In its 2018 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported that the park system in New York City was the ninth-best park system among the fifty most populous U.S. cities. ParkScore ranks urban park systems by a formula that analyzes median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of city residents within a half-mile of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents.\\n\\nNational parks\\nGateway National Recreation Area contains over 26,000 acres (110 km2) in total, most of it surrounded by New York City, including the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. In Brooklyn and Queens, the park contains over 9,000 acres (36 km2) of salt marsh, wetlands, islands, and water, including most of Jamaica Bay. Also in Queens, the park includes a significant portion of the western Rockaway Peninsula, most notably Jacob Riis Park and Fort Tilden. In Staten Island, Gateway National Recreation Area includes Fort Wadsworth, with historic pre-Civil War era Battery Weed and Fort Tompkins, and Great Kills Park, with beaches, trails, and a marina.\\nThe Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island Immigration Museum are managed by the National Park Service and are in both the states of New York and New Jersey. They are joined in the harbor by Governors Island National Monument, in New York. Historic sites under federal management on Manhattan Island include Castle Clinton National Monument; Federal Hall National Memorial; Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site; General Grant National Memorial (\"Grant\\'s Tomb\"); African Burial Ground National Monument; and Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Hundreds of private properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a National Historic Landmark such as, for example, the Stonewall Inn, part of the Stonewall National Monument in Greenwich Village, as the catalyst of the modern gay rights movement.\\n\\nState parks\\nThere are seven state parks within the confines of New York City, including Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve, a natural area that includes extensive riding trails, and Riverbank State Park, a 28-acre (11 ha) facility that rises 69 feet (21 m) over the Hudson River.\\n\\nCity parks\\nNew York City has over 28,000 acres (110 km2) of municipal parkland and 14 miles (23 km) of public beaches. The largest municipal park in the city is Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, with 2,772 acres (1,122 ha).\\nCentral Park, an 843-acre (3.41 km2) park in middle-upper Manhattan, is the most visited urban park in the United States and one of the most filmed locations in the world, with 40 million visitors in 2013. The park has a wide range of attractions; there are several lakes and ponds, two ice-skating rinks, the Central Park Zoo, the Central Park Conservatory Garden, and the 106-acre (0.43 km2) Jackie Onassis Reservoir. Indoor attractions include Belvedere Castle with its nature center, the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater, and the historic Carousel. On October 23, 2012, hedge fund manager John A. Paulson announced a $100 million gift to the Central Park Conservancy, the largest ever monetary donation to New York City\\'s park system.\\nWashington Square Park is a prominent landmark in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. The Washington Square Arch at the northern gateway to the park is an iconic symbol of both New York University and Greenwich Village.\\nProspect Park in Brooklyn has a 90-acre (36 ha) meadow, a lake, and extensive woodlands. Within the park is the historic Battle Pass, prominent in the Battle of Long Island.\\nFlushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, with its 897 acres (363 ha) making it the city\\'s fourth largest park, was the setting for the 1939 World\\'s Fair and the 1964 World\\'s Fair and is host to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and the annual U.S. Open Tennis Championships tournament.\\nOver a fifth of the Bronx\\'s area, 7,000 acres (28 km2), is given over to open space and parks, including Pelham Bay Park, Van Cortlandt Park, the Bronx Zoo, and the New York Botanical Gardens.\\nIn Staten Island, the Conference House Park contains the historic Conference House, site of the only attempt of a peaceful resolution to the American Revolution which was conducted in September 1775, attended by Benjamin Franklin representing the Americans and Lord Howe representing the British Crown. The historic Burial Ridge, the largest Native American burial ground within New York City, is within the park.\\n\\nMilitary installations\\nBrooklyn is home to Fort Hamilton, the U.S. military\\'s only active duty installation within New York City, aside from Coast Guard operations. The facility was established in 1825 on the site of a small battery utilized during the American Revolution, and it is one of America\\'s longest serving military forts. Today Fort Hamilton serves as the headquarters of the North Atlantic Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and for the New York City Recruiting Battalion. It also houses the 1179th Transportation Brigade, the 722nd Aeromedical Staging Squadron, and a military entrance processing station. Other formerly active military reservations still utilized for National Guard and military training or reserve operations in the city include Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island and Fort Totten in Queens.\\n\\nDemographics\\nNew York City is the most populous city in the United States, with an estimated 8,336,817 residents as of July 2019, incorporating more immigration into the city than outmigration since the 2010 United States census. More than twice as many people live in New York City as compared to Los Angeles, the second-most populous U.S. city, and within a smaller area. New York City gained more residents between April 2010 and July 2014 (316,000) than any other U.S. city. New York City\\'s population is about 43% of New York State\\'s population, and about 36% of the population of the New York metropolitan area.\\n\\nPopulation density\\nIn 2017, the city had an estimated population density of 28,491 inhabitants per square mile (11,000/km2), rendering it the nation\\'s most densely populated of all municipalities (of more than 100,000), with several small cities (of fewer than 100,000) in adjacent Hudson County, New Jersey having greater density, as per the 2010 census. Geographically co-extensive with New York County, the borough of Manhattan\\'s 2017 population density of 72,918 inhabitants per square mile (28,154/km2) makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city.\\n\\nRace and ethnicity\\nThe city\\'s population in 2010 was 44% white (33.3% non-Hispanic white), 25.5% Black or African American (23% non-Hispanic black), 0.7% Native American or Alaska Native, and 12.7% Asian. Hispanics or Latinos of any race represented 28.6% of the population, while Asians constituted the fastest-growing segment of the city\\'s population between 2000 and 2010; the non-Hispanic white population declined three percent, the smallest recorded decline in decades; and for the first time since the U.S. Civil War, the number of black people declined over a decade. Throughout its history, New York has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States. More than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924. The term \"melting pot\" was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. By 1900, Germans constituted the largest immigrant group, followed by the Irish, Jews, and Italians. In 1940, whites represented 92% of the city\\'s population.Approximately 37% of the city\\'s population is foreign born, and more than half of all children are born to mothers who are immigrants as of 2013. In New York, no single country or region of origin dominates. The ten largest sources of foreign-born individuals in the city as of 2011 were the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, and Trinidad and Tobago, while the Bangladeshi-born immigrant population has become one of the fastest growing in the city, counting over 74,000 by 2011.\\n\\nAsian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles. New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper. The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state\\'s largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown, in Brooklyn, and around Flushing, Queens, are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves—while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County on Long Island, as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas, with the largest metropolitan Chinese diaspora outside Asia, including an estimated 812,410 individuals in 2015.In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island. A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu or Joseonjok) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens. Koreans made up 1.2% of the city\\'s population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of New York City\\'s population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city\\'s population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. Queens is the preferred borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, Filipinos and Malaysians, and other Southeast Asians; while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers of both West Indian and Asian Indian immigrants.\\nNew York City has the largest European and non-Hispanic white population of any American city. At 2.7 million in 2012, New York\\'s non-Hispanic white population is larger than the non-Hispanic white populations of Los Angeles (1.1 million), Chicago (865,000), and Houston (550,000) combined. The non-Hispanic white population was 6.6 million in 1940. The non-Hispanic white population has begun to increase since 2010.The European diaspora residing in the city is very diverse. According to 2012 Census estimates, there were roughly 560,000 Italian Americans, 385,000 Irish Americans, 253,000 German Americans, 223,000 Russian Americans, 201,000 Polish Americans, and 137,000 English Americans. Additionally, Greek and French Americans numbered 65,000 each, with those of Hungarian descent estimated at 60,000 people. Ukrainian and Scottish Americans numbered 55,000 and 35,000, respectively. People identifying ancestry from Spain numbered 30,838 total in 2010.People of Norwegian and Swedish descent both stood at about 20,000 each, while people of Czech, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Scotch-Irish, and Welsh descent all numbered between 12,000 and 14,000. Arab Americans number over 160,000 in New York City, with the highest concentration in Brooklyn. Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment of the city\\'s non-Hispanic white population, enumerating over 30,000, and including more than half of all Central Asian immigrants to the United States, most settling in Queens or Brooklyn. Albanian Americans are most highly concentrated in the Bronx.The wider New York City metropolitan statistical area, with more than twenty million people, about fifty percent more than second-place Los Angeles, is also ethnically diverse, with the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States, substantially exceeding the combined totals of Los Angeles and Miami. It is home to the largest Jewish and Israeli communities outside Israel, with the Jewish population in the region numbering over 1.5 million in 2012 and including many diverse Jewish sects, predominantly from around the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and including a rapidly growing Orthodox Jewish population, the largest outside Israel.The metropolitan area is also home to 20% of the nation\\'s Indian Americans and at least 20 Little India enclaves, and 15% of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns; the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest Russian American, Italian American, and African American populations; the largest Dominican American, Puerto Rican American, and South American and second-largest overall Hispanic population in the United States, numbering 4.8 million; and includes multiple established Chinatowns within New York City alone.Ecuador, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, and Brazil were the top source countries from South America for legal immigrants to the New York City region in 2013; the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean; Egypt, Ghana, and Nigeria from Africa; and El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala in Central America. Amidst a resurgence of Puerto Rican migration to New York City, this population had increased to approximately 1.3 million in the metropolitan area as of 2013.\\nSince 2010, a Little Australia has emerged and is growing rapidly representing the Australasian presence in Nolita, Manhattan. In 2011, there were an estimated 20,000 Australian residents of New York City, nearly quadruple the 5,537 in 2005. Qantas Airways of Australia and Air New Zealand have been exploring the possibilities of long-haul flights from New York to Sydney and Auckland, respectively, which would both rank among the longest non-stop flights in the world. A Little Sri Lanka has developed in the Tompkinsville neighborhood of Staten Island.\\n\\nSexual orientation and gender identity\\nThe New York metropolitan area is home to a prominent self-identifying gay and bisexual community estimated at nearly 570,000 individuals, the largest in the United States and one of the world\\'s largest. Same-sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011 and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter. Charles Kaiser, author of The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America, wrote that in the era after World War II, \"New York City became the literal gay metropolis for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from within and without the United States: the place they chose to learn how to live openly, honestly and without shame.\"The annual New York City Pride March (or gay pride parade) traverses southward down Fifth Avenue and ends at Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan; the parade rivals the Sao Paulo Gay Pride Parade as the largest pride parade in the world, attracting tens of thousands of participants and millions of sidewalk spectators each June. The annual Queens Pride Parade is held in Jackson Heights and is accompanied by the ensuing Multicultural Parade. Stonewall 50 – WorldPride NYC 2019 was the largest international Pride celebration in history, produced by Heritage of Pride and enhanced through a partnership with the I ❤ NY program\\'s LGBT division, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, with 150,000 participants and five million spectators attending in Manhattan alone. New York City is also home to the largest transgender population in the world, estimated at more than 50,000 in 2018, concentrated in Manhattan and Queens; however, until the June 1969 Stonewall riots, this community had felt marginalized and neglected by the gay community. Brooklyn Liberation March, the largest transgender-rights demonstration in LGBTQ history, took place on June 14, 2020 stretching from Grand Army Plaza to Fort Greene, Brooklyn, focused on supporting Black transgender lives, drawing an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 participants.\\n\\nReligion\\nThe New York area is the 14th-most religious metropolis in the United States. Largely a result of Western European missionary work and colonialism, Christianity is the largest religion as of 2014. Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination (33%), followed by Protestantism (23%), and other Christians (3%). The Roman Catholic population are primarily served by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Diocese of Brooklyn. Eastern Catholics are divided into numerous jurisdictions throughout the city. Evangelical Protestantism is the largest branch of Protestantism in the city (9%), followed by Mainline Protestantism (8%), while the converse is usually true for other cities and metropolitan areas. In Evangelicalism, Baptists are the largest group; in Mainline Protestantism, Reformed Protestants are the largest. The majority of historically African American churches are affiliated with the National Baptist Convention (USA) and Progressive National Baptist Convention. The Church of God in Christ is one of the largest predominantly-black Pentecostal denominations in the area. Less than 1% of the population was Mormon. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and other Orthodox Christians (mainstream and independent) were the largest Eastern Christian groups. The American Orthodox Catholic Church (initially led by Aftimios Ofiesh) was founded in New York City in 1927.\\n\\nJudaism, with approximately 1.1 million adherents, more than half of whom live in Brooklyn, is the second largest religion. The ethnoreligious population makes up 18.4% of the city and its religious demographic makes up 8%. The first recorded Jewish settler was Jacob Barsimson, who arrived in August 1654 on a passport from the Dutch West India Company. Following the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, for which many blamed \"the Jews\", the 36 years beginning in 1881 experienced the largest wave of Jewish immigration to the United States. In 2012, the largest Jewish denominations were Orthodox, Haredi, and Conservative Judaism. Reform Jewish communities are prevalent through the area. Congregation Emanu-El of New York in Manhattan is the largest Reform synagogue in the world. Islam ranks the third largest religion in New York City, with estimates ranging between 600,000 and 1,000,000 observers, including 10% of the city\\'s public school children. Powers Street Mosque in Brooklyn is one of the oldest continuously operating mosques in the U.S., and the first Islamic organization in the city and state. These three largest groups are followed by Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Zoroastrianism, and a variety of other religions, as well as atheism. In 2014, 24% of New Yorkers self-identified with no organized religious affiliation; a little over 3% of New Yorkers were atheist.\\n\\nWealth and income disparity\\nNew York City has a high degree of income disparity, as indicated by its Gini coefficient of 0.55 as of 2017. (This is not unusual, as all large cities have greater income disparities than the nation overall.) In the first quarter of 2014, the average weekly wage in New York County (Manhattan) was $2,749, representing the highest total among large counties in the United States. As of 2017, New York City was home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world at 103, including former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. New York also had the highest density of millionaires per capita among major U.S. cities in 2014, at 4.6% of residents.

The Port of New York and New Jersey is also a major economic engine, handling record cargo volume in 2017, over 6.7 million TEUs.Many Fortune 500 corporations are headquartered in New York City, as are a large number of multinational corporations. One out of ten private sector jobs in the city is with a foreign company. New York City has been ranked first among cities across the globe in attracting capital, business, and tourists.

The city\\'s fashion industry provides approximately 180,000 employees with $11 billion in annual wages.Other important sectors include medical research and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities. Manufacturing accounts for a significant but declining share of employment. The city\\'s apparel and garment industry, historically centered on the Garment District in Manhattan, peaked in 1950, when more than 323,000 workers were employed in the industry in New York. In 2015, fewer than 23,000 New York City residents were employed in the manufacture of garments, accessories, and finished textiles, although efforts to revive the industry were underway. Food processing is a $5 billion industry that employs more than 19,000 residents.\\nChocolate is New York City\\'s leading specialty-food export, with up to $234 million worth of exports each year. Entrepreneurs were forming a \"Chocolate District\" in Brooklyn as of 2014, while Godiva, one of the world\\'s largest chocolatiers, continues to be headquartered in Manhattan.\\n\\nWall Street\\nNew York City\\'s most important economic sector lies in its role as the headquarters for the U.S. financial industry, metonymously known as Wall Street. The city\\'s securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city\\'s financial sector and an important economic engine, accounting in 2012 for 5.0 percent of the city\\'s private sector jobs, 8.5 percent ($3.8 billion) of its tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city\\'s total wages, including an average salary of $360,700.

Investment banking fees on Wall Street totaled approximately $40 billion in 2012, while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as $324,000 annually. In fiscal year 2013–14, Wall Street\\'s securities industry generated 19% of New York State\\'s tax revenue.New York City remains the largest global center for trading in public equity and debt capital markets, driven in part by the size and financial development of the U.S. economy. New York also leads in hedge fund management; private equity; and the monetary volume of mergers and acquisitions. Several investment banks and investment managers headquartered in Manhattan are important participants in other global financial centers. New York is also the principal commercial banking center of the United States.Many of the world\\'s largest media conglomerates are also based in the city. Manhattan contained over 500 million square feet (46.5 million m2) of office space in 2018, making it the largest office market in the United States, while Midtown Manhattan, with 400 million square feet (37.2 million m2) in 2018, is the largest central business district in the world.\\n\\nTech and biotech\\nSilicon Alley, centered in Manhattan, has evolved into a metonym for the sphere encompassing the New York City metropolitan region\\'s high technology industries involving the Internet, new media, telecommunications, digital media, software development, game design, financial technology (\"FinTech\"), and other fields within information technology that are supported by its entrepreneurship ecosystem and venture capital investments. In 2015, Silicon Alley generated over $7.3 billion in venture capital investment across a broad spectrum of high technology enterprises, most based in Manhattan, with others in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region.\\nHigh technology startup companies and employment are growing in New York City and the region, bolstered by the city\\'s position in North America as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines, New York\\'s intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity. Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a $3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City. As of 2014, New York City hosted 300,000 employees in the tech sector. The technology sector has been claiming a greater share of New York City\\'s economy since 2010. Tech:NYC, founded in 2016, is a non-profit organization which represents New York City\\'s technology industry with government, civic institutions, in business, and in the media, and whose primary goals are to further augment New York\\'s substantial tech talent base and to advocate for policies that will nurture tech companies to grow in the city.The biotechnology sector is also growing in New York City, based upon the city\\'s strength in academic scientific research and public and commercial financial support. On December 19, 2011, then Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced his choice of Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to build a $2 billion graduate school of applied sciences called Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island with the goal of transforming New York City into the world\\'s premier technology capital. By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, had raised more than $30 million from investors, including Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, for initial funding to create biotechnology startups at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which encompasses more than 700,000 square feet (65,000 m2) on East 29th Street and promotes collaboration among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, medical, and research institutions. The New York City Economic Development Corporation\\'s Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture capital partners, including Celgene, General Electric Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed a minimum of $100 million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures in life sciences and biotechnology.\\n\\nReal estate\\nReal estate is a major force in the city\\'s economy, as the total value of all New York City property was assessed at $1.072 trillion for the 2017 fiscal year, an increase of 10.6% from the previous year, with 89% of the increase coming from market effects. The Time Warner Center is the property with the highest-listed market value in the city, at $1.1 billion in 2006. New York City is home to some of the nation\\'s—and the world\\'s—most valuable real estate. 450 Park Avenue was sold on July 2, 2007 for $510 million, about $1,589 per square foot ($17,104/m2), breaking the barely month-old record for an American office building of $1,476 per square foot ($15,887/m2) set in the June 2007 sale of 660 Madison Avenue.In 2014, Manhattan was home to six of the top ten ZIP codes in the United States by median housing price. Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commands the highest retail rents in the world, at $3,000 per square foot ($32,000/m2) in 2017. In 2019, the most expensive home sale ever in the United States achieved completion in Manhattan, at a selling price of $238 million, for a 24,000 square feet (2,200 m2) penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park.\\n\\nRental housing\\nIn June 2019, sweeping reforms to NYC rental properties were made. In January 2020, the New York State Department of State issued clarifying guidelines to the reforms that provided for the elimination of decades of broker fees, which have been unique to the NYC housing market in the United States.\\n\\nTourism\\nTourism is a vital industry for New York City, which has witnessed a growing combined volume of international and domestic tourists, receiving an eighth consecutive annual record of approximately 62.8 million visitors in 2017. Tourism had generated an all-time high $61.3 billion in overall economic impact for New York City in 2014, pending 2015 statistics. Approximately 12 million visitors to New York City were from outside the United States, with the highest numbers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, and China.I Love New York (stylized I ❤ NY) is both a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign and have been used since 1977 to promote tourism in New York City, and later to promote New York State as well. The trademarked logo, owned by New York State Empire State Development, appears in souvenir shops and brochures throughout the city and state, some licensed, many not. The song is the state song of New York.\\nMajor tourist destinations in Manhattan include Times Square; Broadway theater productions; the Empire State Building; the Statue of Liberty; Ellis Island; the United Nations Headquarters; the World Trade Center (including the National September 11 Museum and One World Trade Center); museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art; green spaces such as Central Park and Washington Square Park; the Stonewall Inn; Rockefeller Center; ethnic enclaves including the Manhattan Chinatown, Koreatown, Curry Hill, Harlem, Spanish Harlem, Little Italy, and Little Australia; luxury shopping along Fifth and Madison Avenues; and events such as the Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village; the Brooklyn Bridge (shared with Brooklyn); the Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade; the lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree; the St. Patrick\\'s Day parade; seasonal activities such as ice skating in Central Park in the wintertime; the Tribeca Film Festival; and free performances in Central Park at Summerstage.Points of interest in the boroughs outside Manhattan include numerous ethnic enclaves; Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and the Unisphere in Queens; the Bronx Zoo; Coney Island, Brooklyn; and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.

The city is a prominent location for the American entertainment industry, with many films, television series, books, and other media being set there. As of 2012, New York City was the second largest center for filmmaking and television production in the United States, producing about 200 feature films annually, employing 130,000 individuals. The filmed entertainment industry has been growing in New York, contributing nearly $9 billion to the New York City economy alone as of 2015.

The Association of Independent Commercial Producers is also based in New York. In the first five months of 2014 alone, location filming for television pilots in New York City exceeded the record production levels for all of 2013, with New York surpassing Los Angeles as the top North American city for the same distinction during the 2013–2014 cycle.\\nNew York City is also a center for the advertising, music, newspaper, digital media, and publishing industries and is also the largest media market in North America.

In August 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio signed legislation outlawing pharmacies from selling cigarettes once their existing licenses to do so expired, beginning in 2018.\\n\\nPublic safety\\nPolice and law enforcement\\nThe New York Police Department (NYPD) has been the largest police force in the United States by a significant margin, with more than 35,000 sworn officers. Members of the NYPD are frequently referred to by politicians, the media, and their own police cars by the nickname, New York\\'s Finest.\\n\\nCrime has continued an overall downward trend in New York City since the 1990s. In 2012, the NYPD came under scrutiny for its use of a stop-and-frisk program, which has undergone several policy revisions since then. In 2014, New York City had the third lowest murder rate among the largest U.S. cities, having become significantly safer after a spike in crime in the 1970s through 1990s. Violent crime in New York City decreased more than 75% from 1993 to 2005, and continued decreasing during periods when the nation as a whole saw increases. By 2002, New York City was ranked 197th in crime among the 216 U.S. cities with populations greater than 100,000. In 1992, the city recorded 2,245 murders. In 2005, the homicide rate was at its lowest level since 1966, and in 2009, the city recorded fewer than 461 homicides for the first time ever since crime statistics were first published in 1963. In 2017, 60.1% of violent crime suspects were black, 29.6% Hispanic, 6.5% white, 3.6% Asian and 0.2% American Indian. New York City experienced 292 homicides in 2017,Sociologists and criminologists have not reached consensus on the explanation for the dramatic decrease in the city\\'s crime rate. Some attribute the phenomenon to new tactics used by the NYPD, including its use of CompStat and the broken windows theory. Others cite the end of the crack epidemic and demographic changes, including from immigration. Another theory is that widespread exposure to lead pollution from automobile exhaust, which can lower intelligence and increase aggression levels, incited the initial crime wave in the mid-20th century, most acutely affecting heavily trafficked cities like New York. A strong correlation was found demonstrating that violent crime rates in New York and other big cities began to fall after lead was removed from American gasoline in the 1970s. Another theory cited to explain New York City\\'s falling homicide rate is the inverse correlation between the number of murders and the increasingly wet climate in the city.Organized crime has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points in the 1820s. The 20th century saw a rise in the Mafia, dominated by the Five Families, as well as in gangs, including the Black Spades. The Mafia and gang presence has declined in the city in the 21st century.\\n\\nFirefighting\\nThe Fire Department of New York (FDNY), provides fire protection, technical rescue, primary response to biological, chemical, and radioactive hazards, and emergency medical services for the five boroughs of New York City. The FDNY is the largest municipal fire department in the United States and the second largest in the world after the Tokyo Fire Department. The FDNY employs approximately 11,080 uniformed firefighters and more than 3,300 uniformed EMTs and paramedics. The FDNY\\'s motto is New York\\'s Bravest.\\nThe fire department faces multifaceted firefighting challenges in many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to building types that range from wood-frame single family homes to high-rise structures, the FDNY also responds to fires that occur in the New York City Subway. Secluded bridges and tunnels, as well as large parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires, also present challenges.\\nThe FDNY headquarters is located at 9 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn, and the FDNY Fire Academy is located on Randalls Island. There are three Bureau of Fire Communications alarm offices which receive and dispatch alarms to appropriate units. One office, at 11 Metrotech Center in Brooklyn, houses Manhattan/Citywide, Brooklyn, and Staten Island Fire Communications; the Bronx and Queens offices are in separate buildings.\\n\\nPublic library system\\nThe New York Public Library, which has the largest collection of any public library system in the United States, serves Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Queens is served by the Queens Borough Public Library, the nation\\'s second largest public library system, while the Brooklyn Public Library serves Brooklyn.\\n\\nCulture and contemporary life\\nNew York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world by New York\\'s Baruch College. A book containing a series of essays titled New York, Culture Capital of the World, 1940–1965 has also been published as showcased by the National Library of Australia. In describing New York, author Tom Wolfe said, \"Culture just seems to be in the air, like part of the weather.\"Numerous major American cultural movements began in the city, such as the Harlem Renaissance, which established the African-American literary canon in the United States. The city became the center of stand-up comedy in the early 20th century, jazz in the 1940s, abstract expressionism in the 1950s, and the birthplace of hip hop in the 1970s. The city\\'s punk and hardcore scenes were influential in the 1970s and 1980s. New York has long had a flourishing scene for Jewish American literature.\\nThe city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract expressionism (also known as the New York School) in painting; and hip hop, punk, salsa, freestyle, Tin Pan Alley, certain forms of jazz, and (along with Philadelphia) disco in music. New York City has been considered the dance capital of the world. The city is also frequently the setting for novels, movies (see List of films set in New York City), and television programs. New York Fashion Week is one of the world\\'s preeminent fashion events and is afforded extensive coverage by the media. New York has also frequently been ranked the top fashion capital of the world on the annual list compiled by the Global Language Monitor.\\n\\nPace\\nOne of the most common traits attributed to New York City is its fast pace, which spawned the term New York minute. Journalist Walt Whitman characterized New York\\'s streets as being traversed by \"hurrying, feverish, electric crowds\".\\n\\nArts\\nNew York City has more than 2,000 arts and cultural organizations and more than 500 art galleries. The city government funds the arts with a larger annual budget than the National Endowment for the Arts. Wealthy business magnates in the 19th century built a network of major cultural institutions, such as Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which have become internationally renowned. The advent of electric lighting led to elaborate theater productions, and in the 1880s, New York City theaters on Broadway and along 42nd Street began featuring a new stage form that became known as the Broadway musical. Strongly influenced by the city\\'s immigrants, productions such as those of Harrigan and Hart, George M. Cohan, and others used song in narratives that often reflected themes of hope and ambition. New York City itself is the subject or background of many plays and musicals.\\n\\nPerforming arts\\nBroadway theatre is one of the premier forms of English-language theatre in the world, named after Broadway, the major thoroughfare that crosses Times Square, also sometimes referred to as \"The Great White Way\". Forty-one venues in Midtown Manhattan\\'s Theatre District, each with at least 500 seats, are classified as Broadway theatres. According to The Broadway League, Broadway shows sold approximately $1.27 billion worth of tickets in the 2013–2014 season, an 11.4% increase from $1.139 billion in the 2012–2013 season. Attendance in 2013–2014 stood at 12.21 million, representing a 5.5% increase from the 2012–2013 season\\'s 11.57 million. Performance artists displaying diverse skills are ubiquitous on the streets of Manhattan.\\nLincoln Center for the Performing Arts, anchoring Lincoln Square on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is home to numerous influential arts organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Opera, New York Philharmonic, and New York City Ballet, as well as the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the Juilliard School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and Alice Tully Hall. The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute is in Union Square, and Tisch School of the Arts is based at New York University, while Central Park SummerStage presents free music concerts in Central Park.\\n\\nVisual arts\\nNew York City is home to hundreds of cultural institutions and historic sites. Museum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 105th streets on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in an area sometimes called Upper Carnegie Hill. The Mile, which contains one of the densest displays of culture in the world, is actually three blocks longer than one mile (1.6 km). Ten museums occupy the length of this section of Fifth Avenue. The tenth museum, the Museum for African Art, joined the ensemble in 2009, although its museum at 110th Street, the first new museum constructed on the Mile since the Guggenheim in 1959, opened in late 2012. In addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum Mile Festival, held each year in June, to promote the museums and increase visitation. Many of the world\\'s most lucrative art auctions are held in New York City.\\n\\nCuisine\\nNew York City\\'s food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city\\'s immigrant history. Central and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants from those regions, brought bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, knishes, and delicatessens (or delis) to the city. Italian immigrants brought New York-style pizza and Italian cuisine into the city, while Jewish immigrants and Irish immigrants brought pastrami and corned beef, respectively. Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses are ubiquitous throughout the city. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs examples of modern New York street food. The city is home to \"nearly one thousand of the finest and most diverse haute cuisine restaurants in the world\", according to Michelin. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene assigns letter grades to the city\\'s restaurants based upon their inspection results. As of 2019, there were 27,043 restaurants in the city, up from 24,865 in 2017. The Queens Night Market in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park attracts more than ten thousand people nightly to sample food from more than 85 countries.\\n\\nParades\\nNew York City is well known for its street parades, which celebrate a broad array of themes, including holidays, nationalities, human rights, and major league sports team championship victories. The majority of parades are held in Manhattan. The primary orientation of the annual street parades is typically from north to south, marching along major avenues. The annual Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade is the world\\'s largest parade, beginning alongside Central Park and processing southward to the flagship Macy\\'s Herald Square store; the parade is viewed on telecasts worldwide and draws millions of spectators in person. Other notable parades including the annual St. Patrick\\'s Day Parade in March, the LGBT Pride March in June, the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in October, and numerous parades commemorating the independence days of many nations. Ticker-tape parades celebrating championships won by sports teams as well as other heroic accomplishments march northward along the Canyon of Heroes on Broadway from Bowling Green to City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan.\\n\\nAccent and dialect\\nThe New York area is home to a distinctive regional speech pattern called the New York dialect, alternatively known as Brooklynese or New Yorkese. It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within American English.The traditional New York area accent is characterized as non-rhotic, so that the sound [ɹ] does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant; therefore the pronunciation of the city name as \"New Yawk.\" There is no [ɹ] in words like park [pɑək] or [pɒək] (with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low-back chain shift), butter [bʌɾə], or here [hiə]. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the [ɔ] vowel sound of words like talk, law, cross, chocolate, and coffee and the often homophonous [ɔr] in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in General American English. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like \"girl\" and of words like \"oil\" became a diphthong [ɜɪ]. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds, so that girl is pronounced \"goil\" and oil is pronounced \"erl\"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like \"Joizey\" (Jersey), \"Toidy-Toid Street\" (33rd St.) and \"terlet\" (toilet). The character Archie Bunker from the 1970s television sitcom All in the Family was an example of having used this pattern of speech.\\nThe classic version of the New York City dialect is generally centered on middle and working-class New Yorkers. The influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect, and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as it has been in the past.\\n\\nSports\\nNew York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer. The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in the four major North American professional sports leagues with nine, one more than Los Angeles, and has 11 top-level professional sports teams if Major League Soccer is included, also one more than Los Angeles. Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues, and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1882.\\nThe city has played host to more than forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing league. Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide (MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, and Citi Field) are located in the New York metropolitan area. Madison Square Garden, its predecessor, the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field, are sporting venues located in New York City, the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps. New York was the first of eight American cities to have won titles in all four major leagues (MLB, NHL, NFL and NBA), having done so following the Knicks\\' 1970 title. In 1972, it became the first city to win titles in five sports when the Cosmos won the NASL final.\\nNew York has been described as the \"Capital of Baseball\". There have been 35 Major League Baseball World Series and 73 pennants won by New York teams. It is one of only five metro areas (Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore–Washington, and the San Francisco Bay Area being the others) to have two baseball teams. Additionally, there have been 14 World Series in which two New York City teams played each other, known as a Subway Series and occurring most recently in 2000. No other metropolitan area has had this happen more than once (Chicago in 1906, St. Louis in 1944, and the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989).\\nThe city\\'s two Major League Baseball teams are the New York Mets, who play at Citi Field in Queens, and the New York Yankees, who play at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. These teams compete in six games of interleague play every regular season that has also come to be called the Subway Series. The Yankees have won a record 27 championships, while the Mets have won the World Series twice. The city also was once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers (now the Los Angeles Dodgers), who won the World Series once, and the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants), who won the World Series five times. Both teams moved to California in 1958. There are also two Minor League Baseball teams in the city, the Brooklyn Cyclones and Staten Island Yankees.The city is represented in the National Football League by the New York Giants and the New York Jets, although both teams play their home games at MetLife Stadium in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey, which hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014.The metropolitan area is home to three National Hockey League teams. The New York Rangers, the traditional representative of the city itself and one of the league\\'s Original Six, play at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. The New York Islanders, traditionally representing Nassau and Suffolk Counties of Long Island, play at Barclays Center in Brooklyn and are planning a return to Nassau County by way of a new arena just outside the border with Queens at Belmont Park. The New Jersey Devils play at Prudential Center in nearby Newark, New Jersey and traditionally represent the counties of neighboring New Jersey which are coextensive with the boundaries of the New York metropolitan area and media market.\\nThe city\\'s National Basketball Association teams are the Brooklyn Nets, which played in and were named for New Jersey until 2012, and the New York Knicks, while the New York Liberty is the city\\'s Women\\'s National Basketball Association team. The first national college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city. The city is well known for its links to basketball, which is played in nearly every park in the city by local youth, many of whom have gone on to play for major college programs and in the NBA.\\nIn soccer, New York City is represented by New York City FC of Major League Soccer, who play their home games at Yankee Stadium and the New York Red Bulls, who play their home games at Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison, New Jersey. Historically, the city is known for the New York Cosmos, the highly successful former professional soccer team which was the American home of Pelé. A new version of the New York Cosmos was formed in 2010, and began play in the second division North American Soccer League in 2013. The Cosmos play their home games at James M. Shuart Stadium on the campus of Hofstra University, just outside the New York City limits in Hempstead, New York.\\nThe annual United States Open Tennis Championships is one of the world\\'s four Grand Slam tennis tournaments and is held at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens. The New York City Marathon, which courses through all five boroughs, is the world\\'s largest running marathon, with 51,394 finishers in 2016 and 98,247 applicants for the 2017 race. The Millrose Games is an annual track and field meet whose featured event is the Wanamaker Mile. Boxing is also a prominent part of the city\\'s sporting scene, with events like the Amateur Boxing Golden Gloves being held at Madison Square Garden each year. The city is also considered the host of the Belmont Stakes, the last, longest and oldest of horse racing\\'s Triple Crown races, held just over the city\\'s border at Belmont Park on the first or second Sunday of June. The city also hosted the 1932 U.S. Open golf tournament and the 1930 and 1939 PGA Championships, and has been host city for both events several times, most notably for nearby Winged Foot Golf Club. The Gaelic games are played in Riverdale, Bronx at Gaelic Park, home to the New York GAA, the only North American team to compete at the senior inter-county level.\\n\\nEnvironment\\nEnvironmental impact reduction\\nNew York City has focused on reducing its environmental impact and carbon footprint. Mass transit use in New York City is the highest in the United States. Also, by 2010, the city had 3,715 hybrid taxis and other clean diesel vehicles, representing around 28% of New York\\'s taxi fleet in service, the most of any city in North America. New York City is the host of Climate Week NYC, the largest Climate Week to take place globally and regarded as major annual climate summit.\\nNew York\\'s high rate of public transit use, more than 200,000 daily cyclists as of 2014, and many pedestrian commuters make it the most energy-efficient major city in the United States. Walk and bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips in the city; nationally the rate for metro regions is about 8%. In both its 2011 and 2015 rankings, Walk Score named New York City the most walkable large city in the United States, and in 2018, Stacker ranked New York the most walkable U.S. city. Citibank sponsored the introduction of 10,000 public bicycles for the city\\'s bike-share project in the summer of 2013. New York City\\'s numerical \"in-season cycling indicator\" of bicycling in the city had hit an all-time high of 437 when measured in 2014.The city government was a petitioner in the landmark Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency Supreme Court case forcing the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. The city is a leader in the construction of energy-efficient green office buildings, including the Hearst Tower among others. Mayor Bill de Blasio has committed to an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions between 2014 and 2050 to reduce the city\\'s contributions to climate change, beginning with a comprehensive \"Green Buildings\" plan.\\n\\nWater purity and availability\\nNew York City is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed. As a result of the watershed\\'s integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants. The city\\'s municipal water system is the largest in the United States, moving over one billion gallons of water per day. The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a $3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York City\\'s water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city\\'s current availability of water. The ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, an integral part of the New York City water supply system, is the largest capital construction project in the city\\'s history, with segments serving Manhattan and the Bronx completed, and with segments serving Brooklyn and Queens planned for construction in 2020. In 2018, New York City announced a $1 billion investment to protect the integrity of its water system and to maintain the purity of its unfiltered water supply.\\n\\nAir quality\\nAccording to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database, the annual average concentration in New York City\\'s air of particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometers or less (PM2.5) was 7.0 micrograms per cubic meter, or 3.0 micrograms below the recommended limit of the WHO Air Quality Guidelines for the annual mean PM2.5. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, in partnership with Queens College, conducts the New York Community Air Survey to measure pollutants at about 150 locations.\\n\\nEnvironmental revitalization\\nNewtown Creek, a 3.5-mile (6-kilometer) a long estuary that forms part of the border between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, has been designated a Superfund site for environmental clean-up and remediation of the waterway\\'s recreational and economic resources for many communities. One of the most heavily used bodies of water in the Port of New York and New Jersey, it had been one of the most contaminated industrial sites in the country, containing years of discarded toxins, an estimated 30 million US gallons (110,000 m3) of spilled oil, including the Greenpoint oil spill, raw sewage from New York City\\'s sewer system, and other accumulation.\\n\\nGovernment and politics\\nGovernment\\nNew York City has been a metropolitan municipality with a mayor–council form of government since its consolidation in 1898. In New York City, the city government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services.\\nThe Mayor and council members are elected to four-year terms. The City Council is a unicameral body consisting of 51 council members whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries. Each term for the mayor and council members lasts four years and has a three consecutive-term limit, which is reset after a four-year break. The New York City Administrative Code, the New York City Rules, and the City Record are the code of local laws, compilation of regulations, and official journal, respectively.\\n\\nEach borough is coextensive with a judicial district of the state Unified Court System, of which the Criminal Court and the Civil Court are the local courts, while the New York Supreme Court conducts major trials and appeals. Manhattan hosts the First Department of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division while Brooklyn hosts the Second Department. There are also several extrajudicial administrative courts, which are executive agencies and not part of the state Unified Court System.\\nUniquely among major American cities, New York is divided between, and is host to the main branches of, two different U.S. district courts: the District Court for the Southern District of New York, whose main courthouse is on Foley Square near City Hall in Manhattan and whose jurisdiction includes Manhattan and the Bronx; and the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, whose main courthouse is in Brooklyn and whose jurisdiction includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and U.S. Court of International Trade are also based in New York, also on Foley Square in Manhattan.\\n\\nPolitics\\nThe present mayor is Bill de Blasio, the first Democrat since 1993. He was elected in 2013 with over 73% of the vote, and assumed office on January 1, 2014.\\nThe Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. As of April 2016, 69% of registered voters in the city are Democrats and 10% are Republicans. New York City has not been carried by a Republican in a statewide or presidential election since President Calvin Coolidge won the five boroughs in 1924. In 2012, Democrat Barack Obama became the first presidential candidate of any party to receive more than 80% of the overall vote in New York City, sweeping all five boroughs. Party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city. Thirteen out of 27 U.S. congressional districts in the State of New York include portions of New York City.New York is one of the most important sources of political fundraising in the United States. At least four of the top five ZIP Codes in the nation for political contributions were in Manhattan for the 2004, 2006, and 2008 elections. The top ZIP Code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John Kerry. The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends $11.4 billion more than it receives back). City residents and businesses also sent an additional $4.1 billion in the 2009–2010 fiscal year to the state of New York than the city received in return.\\n\\nTransportation\\nNew York City\\'s comprehensive transportation system is both complex and extensive.\\n\\nRapid transit\\nMass transit in New York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the United States, and two-thirds of the nation\\'s rail riders live in the New York City Metropolitan Area.\\n\\nRail\\nThe iconic New York City Subway system is the largest rapid transit system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with 472, and by length of routes. Nearly all of New York\\'s subway system is open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, including Hong Kong, London, Paris, Seoul, and Tokyo. The New York City Subway is also the busiest metropolitan rail transit system in the Western Hemisphere, with 1.76 billion passenger rides in 2015, while Grand Central Terminal, also referred to as \"Grand Central Station\", is the world\\'s largest railway station by number of train platforms.\\n\\nPublic transport is essential in New York City. 54.6% of New Yorkers commuted to work in 2005 using mass transit. This is in contrast to the rest of the United States, where 91% of commuters travel in automobiles to their workplace. According to the New York City Comptroller, workers in the New York City area spend an average of 6 hours and 18 minutes getting to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities. New York is the only U.S. city in which a majority (52%) of households do not have a car; only 22% of Manhattanites own a car. Due to their high usage of mass transit, New Yorkers spend less of their household income on transportation than the national average, saving $19 billion annually on transportation compared to other urban Americans.New York City\\'s commuter rail network is the largest in North America. The rail network, connecting New York City to its suburbs, consists of the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, and New Jersey Transit. The combined systems converge at Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines. In Queens, the elevated AirTrain people mover system connects JFK International Airport to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road; a separate AirTrain system is planned alongside the Grand Central Parkway to connect LaGuardia Airport to these transit systems. For intercity rail, New York City is served by Amtrak, whose busiest station by a significant margin is Pennsylvania Station on the West Side of Manhattan, from which Amtrak provides connections to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. along the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance train service to other North American cities.The Staten Island Railway rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island, operating 24 hours a day. The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to northeastern New Jersey, primarily Hoboken, Jersey City, and Newark. Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day; meaning three of the six rapid transit systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York (the others are a portion of the Chicago \\'L\\', the PATCO Speedline serving Philadelphia, and the Copenhagen Metro).\\nMultibillion-dollar heavy rail transit projects under construction in New York City include the Second Avenue Subway, and the East Side Access project.\\n\\nBuses\\nNew York City\\'s public bus fleet runs 24/7 and is the largest in North America. The Port Authority Bus Terminal, the main intercity bus terminal of the city, serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily, making it the busiest bus station in the world.\\n\\nAir\\nNew York\\'s airspace is the busiest in the United States and one of the world\\'s busiest air transportation corridors. The three busiest airports in the New York metropolitan area include John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport; 130.5 million travelers used these three airports in 2016, and the city\\'s airspace is the busiest in the nation. JFK and Newark Liberty were the busiest and fourth busiest U.S. gateways for international air passengers, respectively, in 2012; as of 2011, JFK was the busiest airport for international passengers in North America.\\n\\nPlans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport, Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, New York, by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities. Other commercial airports in or serving the New York metropolitan area include Long Island MacArthur Airport, Trenton–Mercer Airport and Westchester County Airport. The primary general aviation airport serving the area is Teterboro Airport.\\n\\nFerries\\nThe Staten Island Ferry is the world\\'s busiest ferry route, carrying more than 23 million passengers from July 2015 through June 2016 on the 5.2-mile (8.4 km) route between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan and running 24 hours a day. Other ferry systems shuttle commuters between Manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan area.\\nNYC Ferry, a NYCEDC initiative with routes planned to travel to all five boroughs, was launched in 2017, with second graders choosing the names of the ferries. Meanwhile, Seastreak ferry announced construction of a 600-passenger high-speed luxury ferry in September 2016, to shuttle riders between the Jersey Shore and Manhattan, anticipated to start service in 2017; this would be the largest vessel in its class.\\n\\nTaxis, vehicles for hire, and trams\\nOther features of the city\\'s transportation infrastructure encompass 13,587 yellow taxicabs; other vehicle for hire companies; and the Roosevelt Island Tramway, an aerial tramway that transports commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan Island.\\n\\nStreets and highways\\nDespite New York\\'s heavy reliance on its vast public transit system, streets are a defining feature of the city. The Commissioners\\' Plan of 1811 greatly influenced the city\\'s physical development. Several of the city\\'s streets and avenues, including Broadway, Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and Seventh Avenue are also used as metonyms for national industries there: the theater, finance, advertising, and fashion organizations, respectively.\\nNew York City also has an extensive web of freeways and parkways, which link the city\\'s boroughs to each other and to North Jersey, Westchester County, Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut through various bridges and tunnels. Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who commute into Manhattan, it is quite common for motorists to be stranded for hours in traffic congestion that are a daily occurrence, particularly during rush hour. Congestion pricing in New York City will go into effect in 2022 at the earliest.New York City is also known for its rules regarding turning at red lights. Unlike the rest of the United States, New York State prohibits right or left turns on red in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce traffic collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City, therefore, all turns at red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present.\\n\\nRiver crossings\\nNew York City is located on one of the world\\'s largest natural harbors, and the boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are primarily coterminous with islands of the same names, while Queens and Brooklyn are located at the west end of the larger Long Island, and the Bronx is located on New York State\\'s mainland. This situation of boroughs separated by water led to the development of an extensive infrastructure of bridges and tunnels.\\nThe George Washington Bridge is the world\\'s busiest motor vehicle bridge, connecting Manhattan to Bergen County, New Jersey. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world\\'s longest. The Brooklyn Bridge is an icon of the city itself. The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone, granite, and Rosendale cement, and their architectural style is neo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge. The Queensboro Bridge is an important piece of cantilever architecture. The Manhattan Bridge, opened in 1909, is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges, and its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world; the Manhattan Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge are all examples of Structural Expressionism.Manhattan Island is linked to New York City\\'s outer boroughs and New Jersey by several tunnels as well. The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world. The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan\\'s piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the world\\'s first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through it. The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (officially known as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel) runs underneath Battery Park and connects the Financial District at the southern tip of Manhattan to Red Hook in Brooklyn.\\n\\nCycling network\\nCycling in New York City is associated with mixed cycling conditions that include urban density, relatively flat terrain, congested roadways with \"stop-and-go\" traffic, and many pedestrians. The city\\'s large cycling population includes utility cyclists, such as delivery and messenger services; cycling clubs for recreational cyclists; and increasingly commuters. Cycling is increasingly popular in New York City; in 2017 there were approximately 450,000 daily bike trips, compared with 170,000 daily bike trips in 2005. As of 2017, New York City had 1,333 miles (2,145 km) of bike lanes, compared to 513 miles (826 km) of bike lanes in 2006. As of 2019, there are 126 miles (203 km) of segregated or \"protected\" bike lanes citywide.\\n\\nNotable people\\nGlobal outreach\\nIn 2006, the Sister City Program of the City of New York, Inc. was restructured and renamed New York City Global Partners. Through this program, New York City has expanded its international outreach to a network of cities worldwide, promoting the exchange of ideas and innovation between their citizenry and policymakers. New York\\'s historic sister cities are denoted below by the year they joined New York City\\'s partnership network.\\n\\nSee also\\nOutline of New York City\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nBelden, E.

              " 'Nicole Kidman': 'Nicole Mary Kidman  (born 20 June 1967) is an Australian actress, singer, and producer. She has received an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and five Golden Globe Awards. She was ranked among the world\\'s highest-paid actresses in 2006, 2018, and 2019. Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and again in 2018. In 2020, The New York Times ranked her fifth on its list of the greatest actors of the 21st century up to that point.Kidman began her acting career in Australia with the 1983 films Bush Christmas and BMX Bandits. Her breakthrough came in 1989 with the thriller film Dead Calm and the miniseries Bangkok Hilton. In 1990, she made her Hollywood debut in the racing film Days of Thunder, opposite Tom Cruise. She went on to achieve wider recognition with lead roles in Far and Away (1992), Batman Forever (1995), To Die For (1995) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999). Kidman won the Academy Award for Best Actress for portraying the writer Virginia Woolf in the drama The Hours (2002). Her other Oscar-nominated roles were as a courtesan in the musical Moulin Rouge! (2001) and emotionally troubled mothers in the dramas Rabbit Hole (2010) and Lion (2016). Kidman\\'s other film credits include The Others (2001), Cold Mountain (2003), Dogville (2003), Birth (2004), Australia (2008), The Paperboy (2012), Paddington (2014), The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), Destroyer (2018), Aquaman (2018) and Bombshell (2019).\\nKidman\\'s television roles include Hemingway & Gellhorn (2012), Big Little Lies (2017–2019), Top of the Lake: China Girl (2017), and The Undoing (2020). For Big Little Lies, she won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress and Outstanding Limited Series (as executive producer).\\nKidman has been a Goodwill ambassador for UNICEF since 1994 and for UNIFEM since 2006. In 2006, she was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia. Since she was born to Australian parents in Hawaii, Kidman holds dual citizenship of Australia and the United States. In 2010, she founded the production company Blossom Films. She was married to actor Tom Cruise from 1990 to 2001, and has been married to country music singer Keith Urban since 2006.\\n\\nEarly life\\nNicole Mary Kidman was born on 20 June 1967 in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were temporarily in the United States on student visas. Her mother, Janelle Ann (née Glenny), is a nursing instructor who edited her husband\\'s books and was a member of the Women\\'s Electoral Lobby; her father, Antony Kidman, was a biochemist, clinical psychologist and author. Kidman has Irish and Scottish ancestry.Being born in Hawaii, she was given the Hawaiian name \"Hōkūlani\", meaning \"heavenly star\". The inspiration came from a baby elephant born around the same time at the Honolulu Zoo.When Kidman was born, her father was a graduate student at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. He became a visiting fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health of the United States. Opposed to the war in Vietnam, Kidman\\'s parents participated in anti-war protests while living in Washington, D.C. The family returned to Australia when Kidman was four and her mother now lives on Sydney\\'s North Shore. Kidman has a younger sister, Antonia Kidman, a journalist and TV presenter.Kidman grew up in Sydney and attended Lane Cove Public School and North Sydney Girls\\' High School. She was enrolled in ballet at three and showed her natural talent for acting in her primary and high school years. She has said she first aspired to become an actress upon watching Margaret Hamilton\\'s performance as the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz. Kidman has revealed that she was timid as a child, saying, \"I am very shy – really shy – I even had a stutter as a kid, which I slowly got over, but I still regress into that shyness. So I don\\'t like walking into a crowded restaurant by myself; I don\\'t like going to a party by myself.\"She initially studied at the Phillip Street Theatre in Sydney, alongside Naomi Watts who had attended the same high school. She also attended the Australian Theatre for Young People. Here she took up drama, mime and performing in her teens, finding acting to be a refuge. Owing to her fair skin and naturally red hair, the Australian sun forced the young Kidman to rehearse in halls of the theatre. A regular at the Phillip Street Theatre, she received praise and encouragement to pursue acting full time.\\n\\nCareer\\n1983–1994: Beginnings\\nIn 1983, 16-year-old Kidman made her film debut in a remake of the Australian holiday season favourite Bush Christmas. By the end of 1983, she had a supporting role in the television series Five Mile Creek. In 1984, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, which caused Kidman to halt her acting work temporarily while she studied massage so she could help her mother with physical therapy. She began gaining popularity in the mid-1980s after appearing in several film roles, including BMX Bandits (1983), Watch the Shadows Dance (1987 aka Nightmaster), and the romantic comedy Windrider (1986), which earned Kidman attention due to her racy scenes. Also during the decade, she appeared in several Australian productions, including the soap opera A Country Practice and the 1987 miniseries Vietnam. She also made guest appearances on Australian television programs and TV movies.\\nIn 1988, Kidman appeared in Emerald City, based on the play of the same name. The Australian film earned her an Australian Film Institute award for Best Supporting Actress. Kidman next starred with Sam Neill in Dead Calm (1989) as Rae Ingram, playing the wife of a naval officer. The thriller brought Kidman to international recognition; Variety commented: \"Throughout the film, Kidman is excellent. She gives the character of Rae real tenacity and energy.\" Meanwhile, critic Roger Ebert noted the excellent chemistry between the leads, stating, \"Kidman and Zane do generate real, palpable hatred in their scenes together.\" She followed that up with the Australian miniseries Bangkok Hilton. She next moved on to star alongside her then-boyfriend and future husband, Tom Cruise, in the 1990 auto racing film Days of Thunder, as a young doctor who falls in love with a NASCAR driver. It is Kidman\\'s American debut and was among the highest-grossing films of the year.In 1991, she co-starred with Thandie Newton and former classmate Naomi Watts in the Australian independent film Flirting. They portrayed high school girls in this coming of age story, which won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film. That same year, her work in the film Billy Bathgate earned Kidman her first Golden Globe Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actress. The New York Times, in its film review, called her \"a beauty with, it seems, a sense of humor\". The following year, she and Cruise re-teamed for Ron Howard\\'s Irish epic Far and Away (1992), which was a modest critical and commercial success. In 1993, she starred in the thriller Malice opposite Alec Baldwin and the drama My Life opposite Michael Keaton.\\n\\n1995–2003: Worldwide recognition\\nIn 1995, Kidman played Dr. Chase Meridian, the damsel in distress, in the superhero film Batman Forever, opposite Val Kilmer as the film\\'s title character. The same year, she starred in Gus Van Sant\\'s critically acclaimed dark comedy To Die For, in which she played the murderous newscaster Suzanne Stone. Of Kidman\\'s Golden Globe Award-winning performance, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said \"[she] brings to the role layers of meaning, intention and impulse. Telling her story in close-up – as she does throughout the film – Kidman lets you see the calculation, the wheels turning, the transparent efforts to charm that succeed in charming all the same.\" Kidman next appeared, alongside Barbara Hershey and John Malkovich, in The Portrait of a Lady (1996), based on the novel of the same name, and starred in The Peacemaker (1997) as White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly, opposite George Clooney. The latter film grossed US$110 million worldwide. Kidman starred in comedy Practical Magic (1998) with Sandra Bullock as two witch sisters who face a curse which threatens to prevent them ever finding lasting love. While the film opened atop the chart on its North American opening weekend, it flopped at the box office. She returned to her work on stage the same year in the David Hare play The Blue Room, which opened in London.In 1999, Kidman reunited with then-husband, Tom Cruise, to portray a Manhattan couple on a sexual odyssey, in Eyes Wide Shut, the final film of director Stanley Kubrick. It was subject to censorship controversies due to the explicit nature of its sex scenes. After a brief hiatus and a highly publicised divorce from Cruise, Kidman returned to the screen to play a mail-order bride in the British-American drama Birthday Girl. In 2001, Kidman played the cabaret actress and courtesan Satine in Baz Luhrmann\\'s musical Moulin Rouge!, opposite Ewan McGregor. Her performance and her singing received positive reviews; Paul Clinton of CNN.com called it her best work since To Die For, and wrote \"[she] is smoldering and stunning as Satine. She moves with total confidence throughout the film [...] Kidman seems to specialize in \\'ice queen\\' characters, but with Satine, she allows herself to thaw, just a bit.\" Subsequently, Kidman received her second Golden Globe Award, for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, as well as many other acting awards and nominations. She also received her first Academy Award nomination, for Best Actress.\\n\\nKidman also starred in Alejandro Amenábar\\'s horror film The Others (2001), as Grace Stewart, a mother living in the Channel Islands during World War II who suspects her house is haunted. Grossing over US$210 million worldwide, the film also earned several Goya Award nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Kidman. She received her second BAFTA Award and fifth Golden Globe Award nominations. Roger Ebert commented that \"Alejandro Amenábar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation, and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric.\" Kidman was named the World\\'s Most Beautiful Person by People magazine in 2002.In 2002, Kidman garnered critical acclaim for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry\\'s The Hours, co-starring Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Kidman famously wore prosthetics that were applied to her nose making her almost unrecognizable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an Academy Award for Best Picture. The New York Times wrote that, \"Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain\". Kidman won numerous critics\\' awards, including her first BAFTA Award, third Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actress. As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech about the importance of art, even during times of war, saying, \"Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. And because you believe in what you do and you want to honour that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld.\"Following her Oscar win, Kidman appeared in three very different films in 2003. The first, a leading role in Dogville, by Danish director Lars von Trier, was an experimental film set on a bare soundstage. Though the film divided critics in the United States, Kidman still earned praise for her performance. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone stated, \"Kidman gives the most emotionally bruising performance of her career in Dogville, a movie that never met a cliche it didn\\'t stomp on.\" The second was an adaptation of Philip Roth\\'s novel The Human Stain, opposite Anthony Hopkins. Her third film was Anthony Minghella\\'s war drama Cold Mountain. Kidman starred opposite Jude Law and Renée Zellweger, playing Southerner Ada Monroe, who is in love with Law\\'s character and separated by the Civil War. Time magazine wrote, \"Kidman takes strength from Ada\\'s plight and grows steadily, literally luminous. Her sculptural pallor gives way to warm radiance in the firelight\". The film garnered several award nominations and wins for its actors; Kidman received her sixth Golden Globe Award nomination at the 61st Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress.\\n\\n2004–2009: Continued success\\nIn 2004 she starred in the film Birth, which sparked controversy over a scene in which Kidman shares a bath with her co-star Cameron Bright, then aged ten. At a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, she addressed the controversy saying, \"It wasn\\'t that I wanted to make a film where I kiss a 10-year-old boy. I wanted to make a film where you understand love\". Kidman received her seventh Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama. That same year, she appeared as a successful producer in the black comedy-science-fiction film The Stepford Wives, a remake of the 1975 film of the same name, directed by Frank Oz. In 2005, Kidman appeared opposite Sean Penn in the Sydney Pollack thriller The Interpreter, playing UN translator Silvia Broome, and with Will Ferrell in the romantic comedy Bewitched, based on the 1960s TV sitcom of the same name. While neither film fared well in the United States, both were international successes. Kidman and Ferrell earned the Razzie Award for Worst Screen Couple.\\nIn conjunction with her success within the film industry, Kidman became the face of the Chanel No. 5 perfume brand. She starred in a campaign of television and print ads with Rodrigo Santoro, directed by Moulin Rouge! director Baz Luhrmann, to promote the fragrance during the holiday seasons of 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008. The three-minute commercial produced for Chanel No. 5 made Kidman the record holder for the most money paid per minute to an actor after she reportedly earned US$12 million for the three-minute advert. During this time, Kidman was also featured as the 45th Most Powerful Celebrity on the 2005 Forbes Celebrity 100 List. She made a reported US$14.5 million in 2004–2005. On People magazine\\'s list of 2005\\'s highest-paid actresses, Kidman was second behind Julia Roberts, with US$16–17 million per-film price tag. Nintendo in 2007 announced that Kidman would be the new face of Nintendo\\'s advertising campaign for the Nintendo DS game More Brain Training in its European market.In 2006, Kidman portrayed photographer Diane Arbus in the biographical film Fur, opposite Robert Downey Jr., and lent her voice to the animated film Happy Feet, which grossed over US$384 million worldwide. In 2007, she starred in the science-fiction film The Invasion directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, a remake of the 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and starred opposite Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jack Black in Noah Baumbach\\'s comedy-drama Margot at the Wedding, which earned her a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actress – Musical or Comedy. She also starred in the fantasy-adventure, The Golden Compass (2007), playing the villainous Marisa Coulter.\\nIn 2008, she reunited with Moulin Rouge! director Baz Luhrmann in the Australian period film Australia, set in the remote Northern Territory during the Japanese attack on Darwin during World War II. Kidman starred opposite Hugh Jackman as an Englishwoman feeling overwhelmed by the continent. The acting was praised and the film was a box office success worldwide. Kidman appeared in the 2009 Rob Marshall musical Nine, portraying the Federico Fellini-like character\\'s muse, Claudia Jenssen, with fellow Oscar winners Daniel Day-Lewis, Judi Dench, Marion Cotillard, Penélope Cruz and Sophia Loren. Kidman, whose screen time was brief in comparison to the other actresses, performed the musical number \"Unusual Way\", alongside Day-Lewis. The film received several Golden Globe Award and Academy Award nominations, and earned Kidman a fourth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, as part of the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\\n\\n2010–2015: Biographical and independent films\\nIn 2010, Kidman starred with Aaron Eckhart in the film adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play Rabbit Hole, for which she vacated her role in the Woody Allen picture You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger. Her portrayal as a grieving mother in the film earned her critical acclaim, and received nominations for the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. She lent her voice to a promotional video that Australia used to support its bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In 2011, she starred alongside Nicolas Cage in director Joel Schumacher\\'s action-thriller Trespass, with the stars playing a married couple taken hostage, and appeared with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston in Dennis Dugan\\'s romantic comedy Just Go with It, as a trophy wife.\\n\\nIn 2012, Kidman and Clive Owen starred in the HBO film Hemingway & Gellhorn, and about Ernest Hemingway and his relationship with Martha Gellhorn. In Lee Daniels\\' adaptation of the Pete Dexter novel, The Paperboy (2012), she portrayed death row groupie Charlotte Bless, and performed sex scenes that she claims not to have remembered until seeing the finished film. The film competed in the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, and Kidman\\'s performance drew nominations for the SAG and the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress, gave Kidman her second Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress and her tenth nomination overall. In 2012, Kidman\\'s audiobook recording of Virginia Woolf\\'s To the Lighthouse was released at Audible.com. Kidman starred as an unstable mother in Park Chan-wook\\'s Stoker (2013), to a positive response and a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In April 2013 she was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.In 2014, Kidman starred in the biographical film Grace of Monaco in the title role that chronicles the 1962 crisis, in which Charles de Gaulle blockaded the tiny principality, angered by Monaco\\'s status as a tax haven for wealthy French subjects and Kelly\\'s contemplating a Hollywood return to star in Alfred Hitchcock\\'s Marnie. Opening out of competition at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, the film received largely negative reviews. Kidman also starred in two films with Colin Firth that year, the first being the British-Australian historical drama The Railway Man, in which Kidman played an officer\\'s wife. Katherine Monk of the Montreal Gazette said of Kidman\\'s performance, \"It\\'s a truly masterful piece of acting that transcends Teplitzky\\'s store-bought framing, but it\\'s Kidman who delivers the biggest surprise: For the first time since her eyebrows turned into solid marble arches, the Australian Oscar winner is truly terrific\". Her second film with Firth was the British thriller film Before I Go To Sleep, portraying a car crash survivor with brain damage. She also appeared in the family film Paddington (2014) as a villain.\\nIn 2015, Kidman starred in the drama Strangerland, which opened at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, and the Jason Bateman-directed The Family Fang, produced by Kidman\\'s production company, Blossom Films, which premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.

Kidman played a district attorney, opposite Julia Roberts and Chiwetel Ejiofor, in the little-seen film Secret in Their Eyes (also 2015), a remake of the 2009 Argentine film of the same name, both based on the novel La pregunta de sus ojos by author Eduardo Sacheri. After more than 15 years, Kidman returned to the West End in the UK premiere of Photograph 51 at the Noël Coward Theatre. She starred as British scientist Rosalind Franklin, working for the discovery of the structure of DNA, in the production from 5 September to 21 November 2015, directed by Michael Grandage. Her return to the West End was hailed a success, especially after having won an acting award for her portrayal in the play.\\n\\n2016–present: Resurgence and television career\\nIn 2016\\'s Lion, Kidman portrayed Sue, the adoptive mother of Saroo Brierley, an Indian boy who was separated from his birth family, a role she felt connected to as she herself is the mother of adopted children. She garnered rave reviews for her performance, as well as nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, her fourth nomination overall, and her eleventh Golden Globe Award nomination, among others. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times thought that \"Kidman gives a powerful and moving performance as Saroo\\'s adoptive mother, who loves her son with every molecule of her being, but comes to understand his quest. It\\'s as good as anything she\\'s done in the last decade.\" Budgeted at US$12 million, Lion earned over US$140 million globally. She also gave a voice-over performance for the English version of the animated film The Guardian Brothers.\\n\\nIn 2017, Kidman returned to television for Big Little Lies, a drama series based on Liane Moriarty\\'s novel, which premiered on HBO. She also served as executive producer alongside her co-star, Reese Witherspoon, and the show\\'s director, Jean-Marc Vallée. She played Celeste Wright, a former lawyer and housewife, who is concealing her abusive relationship with her husband, played by Alexander Skarsgård. Matthew Jacobs of The Huffington Post considered that she \"delivered a career-defining performance\", while Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that \"Kidman belongs in the pantheon of great actresses\". She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her performance, as well as winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series as a producer. She also won a Critics\\' Choice Television Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award.Kidman next played Martha Farnsworth, the headmistress of an all-girls school during the American Civil War, in Sofia Coppola\\'s drama The Beguiled, a remake of a 1971 film of the same name, which premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, competing for the Palme d\\'Or. Both films were adaptations of a novel by Thomas P. Cullinan, The film was an arthouse success, and Katie Walsh of Tribune News Service found Kidman \"particularly, unsurprisingly excellent in her performance as the steely Miss Martha. She is controlled and in control, unflappable. Her genteel manners and femininity co-exist easily with her toughness.\" Kidman had two other films premiere at the festival, the science-fiction romantic comedy How to Talk to Girls at Parties, reuniting her with director John Cameron Mitchell, and the psychological thriller The Killing of a Sacred Deer, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, which also competed for the Palme d\\'Or. Also in 2017, Kidman played supporting roles in the BBC Two television series Top of the Lake: China Girl and in the comedy-drama The Upside, a remake of the 2011 French comedy The Intouchables, starring Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart.Kidman starred in two 2018 dramas—Destroyer and Boy Erased. In the former, she played a detective troubled by a case for two decades. Peter Debruge of Variety and Brooke Marine of W both found her \"unrecognizable\" in the role and Debruge added that \"she disappears into an entirely new skin, rearranging her insides to fit the character\\'s tough hide\", whereas Marine highlighted Kidman\\'s method acting. The latter film is based on Garrard Conley\\'s Boy Erased: A Memoir, and features Russell Crowe and Kidman as socially conservative parents who send their son (played by Lucas Hedges) to a gay conversion program. Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair credited all three performers for \"elevating the fairly standard-issue material to poignant highs\". Also that year, Kidman played Queen Atlanna, the mother of the title character, in the DC Extended Universe superhero film Aquaman. Nicole was interviewed for BAFTA A Life in Pictures in November 2018, where she reflected on her extensive career in film.Forbes ranked her as the fourth highest-paid actress in the world in 2019, with an annual income of $34 million. She took on the supporting part of a rich socialite in John Crowley\\'s drama The Goldfinch, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Donna Tartt, starring Ansel Elgort. Although it was poorly received, Owen Gleiberman commended Kidman for playing her part with \"elegant affection\". She next starred alongside Charlize Theron and Margot Robbie in the drama Bombshell, about sexual harassment at Fox News, in which she portrayed Gretchen Carlson. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times opined that despite lesser screen time than her two co-protagonists, Kidman successfully made Carlson \"ever-so-slightly ridiculous, adding a sharp sliver of comedy that underscores how self-serving and futile her rebellious gestures at the network are\". For her performance in Bombshell, Kidman received another Screen Actor Guild nomination.In 2020, Kidman played Grace Fraser, a successful therapist in New York, in the HBO psychological thriller miniseries The Undoing, based on the novel You Should Have Known by Jean Hanff Korelitz. Kidman served as executive producer alongside the show\\'s director, Susanne Bier, and David E. Kelley. Kelley previously adapted and produced Big Little Lies for television and also adapted The Undoing for television. Kidman was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance.Kidman\\'s only film release of 2020 is the musical comedy film The Prom based on the Broadway musical of the same name. Kidman will star in the film alongside Meryl Streep, James Corden and Andrew Rannells. The Prom was released on Netflix on 11 December 2020.\\n\\nUpcoming projects\\nKidman will star in and serve as executive producer on three television series. She will first star in the Hulu miniseries Nine Perfect Strangers based on the novel of the same name by Liane Moriarty which is currently in production in Australia. Furthermore, Kidman will star in the Amazon Prime Video thriller miniseries Pretty Things based on the upcoming novel of the same name by Janelle Brown as well as the Amazon Prime Video family drama series Things I Know To Be True based on the Australian play of the same name. Unlike Nine Perfect Strangers and Pretty Things, Things I Know To Be True is envisioned as an ongoing series with multiple seasons rather than a miniseries.Kidman will also serve as an executive producer for the television series The Expatriates for Amazon Prime Video. In January 2021, Kidman and Javier Bardem signed on to play legendary Hollywood couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in Amazon Studios and Aaron Sorkin\\'s Being the Ricardos.\\n\\nMedia image\\nSeveral media publications consider Kidman to be among the finest actresses of her generation. She is noted for taking on risky roles in films helmed by auteurs. In 2020, The New York Times ranked her as one of the greatest actors of the 21st century.Kidman has also been described as a fashion icon. The chartreuse Dior gown she wore to the 1997 Academy Awards is regarded as one of the greatest dresses in Oscar history and The Daily Telegraph credit it with changing red carpet fashion forever. She was the recipient of the 2003 Fashion Icon Award by the Council of Fashion Designers of America. \"Nicole Kidman\\'s style, both on and off the screen, has had an undeniable impact on fashion,\" said Peter Arnold, executive director of CFDA.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nRelationships and children\\nKidman has been married twice: first to actor Tom Cruise, and later to country singer Keith Urban. Kidman met Cruise in November 1989, while filming Days of Thunder; they were married on Christmas Eve in Telluride, Colorado. The couple adopted a daughter, Isabella Jane Cruise (born 1992), and a son, Connor Antony Cruise (born 1995). The couple lived in the NoHo neighborhood in Manhattan. On 5 February 2001, the couple\\'s spokesperson announced their separation. Cruise filed for divorce two days later, and the marriage was dissolved in August of that year, with Cruise citing irreconcilable differences. In a 2007 interview with Marie Claire, Kidman noted the incorrect reporting of the ectopic pregnancy early in her marriage. \"It was wrongly reported as miscarriage, by everyone who picked up the story.\" \"So it\\'s huge news, and it didn\\'t happen.\"\\n\\nIn the June 2006 issue of Ladies\\' Home Journal, she said she still loved Cruise: \"He was huge; still is. To me, he was just Tom, but to everybody else, he is huge. But he was lovely to me and I loved him. I still love him.\" In addition, she has expressed shock about their divorce. In 2015, former Church of Scientology executive Mark Rathbun claimed in a documentary film that he was instructed to \"facilitate [Cruise\\'s] break-up with Nicole Kidman\". Cruise\\'s auditor further claimed Kidman had been wiretapped on Cruise\\'s suggestion.Prior to marrying Cruise, Kidman had been involved in relationships with Australian actor Marcus Graham and Windrider (1986) co-star Tom Burlinson. She was also said to be involved with Adrien Brody. The film Cold Mountain brought rumours that an affair between Kidman and co-star Jude Law was responsible for the break-up of his marriage. Both denied the allegations, and Kidman won an undisclosed sum from the British tabloids that published the story. She met musician Lenny Kravitz in 2003, and dated him into 2004. Kidman was also romantically linked to rapper Q-Tip. Robbie Williams claims he had a short romance with Kidman on her yacht in summer 2004.In a 2007 Vanity Fair interview, Kidman revealed that she had been secretly engaged to someone prior to her present relationship with New Zealand-Australian country singer Keith Urban, whom she met at G\\'Day LA, an event honouring Australians, in January 2005. Kidman married Urban on 25 June 2006, at Cardinal Cerretti Memorial Chapel on the grounds of St Patrick\\'s Estate, Manly in Sydney. In an interview in 2015, Kidman said, \"We didn\\'t really know each other – we got to know each other during our marriage.\" They maintain homes in Sydney, Sutton Forest (New South Wales, Australia); Los Angeles; Nashville (Tennessee, U.S.); and a condominium in Manhattan purchased for US$10 million. The couple\\'s first daughter, Sunday Rose, was born in 2008, in Nashville. In 2010, Kidman and Urban had their second daughter, Faith Margaret, via gestational surrogacy at Nashville\\'s Centennial Women\\'s Hospital. In an interview by Tina Brown at the 2015 Women in the World conference, she stated that her attention turned to her career after her divorce from Cruise: \"Out of my divorce came work that was applauded so that was an interesting thing for me\", leading to her Academy Award in 2003.\\n\\nReligious and political views\\nKidman was brought up in an Irish Catholic family and remains practicing. She attended Mary Mackillop Chapel in North Sydney. Following criticism of The Golden Compass by Catholic leaders as anti-Catholic, Kidman told Entertainment Weekly that the Catholic Church is part of her \"essence\", and that her religious beliefs would prevent her from taking a role in a film she perceived as anti-Catholic. During her divorce from Tom Cruise, she stated that she did not want their children raised as Scientologists. She has been reluctant to discuss Scientology since her divorce.A supporter of women\\'s rights, Kidman testified before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs to support the International Violence Against Women Act in 2009. In January 2017, she stated her support for the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Australia. Kidman has also donated to U.S. Democratic party candidates.\\n\\nWealth, philanthropy, and honours\\nIn 2002, Kidman first appeared on the Australian rich list published annually in the Business Review Weekly with an estimated net worth of A$122 million. In the 2011 published list, Kidman\\'s wealth was estimated at A$304 million, down from A$329 million in 2010. Kidman has raised money for, and drawn attention to, disadvantaged children around the world. In 1994, she was appointed a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF, and in 2004, she was honoured as a \"Citizen of the World\" by the United Nations. Kidman joined the Little Tee Campaign for breast cancer care to design T-shirts or vests to raise money to fight the disease; motivated by her mother\\'s own battle with breast cancer in 1984.\\n\\nIn the 2006 Australia Day Honours, Kidman was appointed Companion of Order of Australia (AC) for \"service to the performing arts as an acclaimed motion picture performer, to health care through contributions to improve medical treatment for women and children and advocacy for cancer research, to youth as a principal supporter of young performing artists, and to humanitarian causes in Australia and internationally\". However, due to film commitments and her wedding to Urban, it wasn\\'t until 13 April 2007 that she was presented with the honour. It was presented by the Governor-General of Australia, Major General Michael Jeffery, in a ceremony at Government House, Canberra.Kidman was appointed goodwill ambassador of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) in 2006. She visited Kosovo in 2006 to learn about women\\'s experiences of conflict and UNIFEM\\'s support efforts. She is also the international spokesperson for UNIFEM\\'s Say NO – UNiTE to End Violence against Women initiative. Kidman and the UNIFEM executive director presented over five million signatures collected during the first phase of this to the UN Secretary-General on 25 November 2008. In 2016, Kidman donated $50,000 to UN Women.In the beginning of 2009, Kidman appeared in a series of postage stamps featuring Australian actors. She, Geoffrey Rush, Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett each appear twice in the series: once as themselves and once as their Academy Award-nominated character; Kidman\\'s second stamp showed her as Satine from Moulin Rouge!. On 8 January 2010, alongside Nancy Pelosi, Joan Chen and Joe Torre, Kidman attended the ceremony to help the Family Violence Prevention Fund break ground on a new international centre located in the Presidio of San Francisco. In 2015, Kidman became the brand ambassador for Etihad Airways.Kidman supports the Nashville Predators, being seen and photographed almost nightly throughout the season. Additionally, she supports the Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League and once served as a club ambassador.Her hobby is collecting ancient Judean coins. She frequently visits specialized auctions in order to acquire rare ancient coins from Ancient Judea.\\n\\nFilmography\\nDiscography\\nKidman\\'s discography consists of one spoken word album, one extended play, three singles, three music videos, ten other appearances, a number of unreleased tracks and two tribute songs recorded by various artists.\\nKidman, primarily known in the field of acting, entered the music industry in the 2000s after recording a number of tracks for the soundtrack album to Baz Luhrmann\\'s 2001 motion picture Moulin Rouge!, which she starred in. Her duet with Ewan McGregor entitled \"Come What May\" was released as her debut and the second single of the OST through Interscope on 24 September 2001. The composition became the eighth-highest selling single by an Australian artist for that year, being certified Gold by Australian Recording Industry Association, while reaching on the UK Singles Chart at number twenty-seven. In addition, the song received a nomination at the 59th Golden Globe Awards as the Best Original Song, and has been listed as the eighty-fifth within AFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Songs by American Film Institute.\"Somethin\\' Stupid\", a cover version of Frank and Nancy Sinatra followed soon. The track, recorded as a duet with English singer-songwriter Robbie Williams, was issued on 14 December 2001 by Chrysalis Records as the lead single of his fourth studio album, Swing When You\\'re Winning. Kidman\\'s second single topped the official music charts in New Zealand, Portugal, and England, as well as scored top ten placings all over Europe, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. Apart from being certified either Gold or Silver in a number of countries, it was classified as the thirteenth best-selling single of 2002 in the UK, the fifty-ninth in Australia, and the ninety-third in France, respectively. The song peaked at No. 8 in the Australian ARIAnet Singles Chart and at No. 1, for three weeks, in the UK.On 5 April 2002, Kidman released, through Interscope, her third single, a cover of Randy Crawford\\'s \"One Day I\\'ll Fly Away\". The song, a Tony Philips remix, was promoted as the pilot single of a follow-up to the original soundtrack of the same name, Moulin Rouge! Vol. 2. In 2006, she contributed with her vocal for the OST Happy Feet on a rendition of the Prince song \"Kiss\". In 2009, she was featured on the soundtrack of Rob Marshall\\'s 2009 movie musical Nine, singing the song\\n\"Unusual Way\".Her name was later credited on a track called \"What\\'s the Procedure\", issued on 14 March 2013, on the compilation album I Know Why They Call It Pop: Volume 2 by Rok Lok Records. Among others, Kidman also narrated an audiobook in 2012.In 2017, she and Nicolle Gaylon sang backing vocals on her husband, country music singer Keith Urban\\'s song \"Female\".\\n\\nAwards\\nIn 2003, Kidman received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

              " 'Oblivion (2013 film)': 'Oblivion is a 2013 American post-apocalyptic action-adventure film co-produced and directed by Joseph Kosinski, and produced by Peter Chernin with screenplay by Karl Gajdusek and Michael deBruyn, starring Tom Cruise in the main role alongside Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough, Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in supporting roles. Oblivion, based on Kosinski\\'s unpublished graphic novel of the same name, pays homage to 1970s science fiction films.Oblivion takes place in 2077, on an Earth devastated by war with extraterrestrials that has caused humanity to relocate itself to Titan. The film follows the story of Jack Harper, a technician who has been sent back to Earth to service drones used in the fight against remaining extraterrestrials (scavengers). After witnessing a spacecraft crash, from which he is able to rescue a survivor, Harper is captured by scavengers and fights against a new and evolving alien threat.\\nOblivion was released in IMAX by Universal Pictures on April 19, 2013 and held its world premiere in Buenos Aires on March 26, 2013. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $286 million worldwide, on a production budget of $120 million.\\n\\nPlot\\nBy March 14, 2077, Jack Harper and Victoria “Vika” Olsen are among the few humans left on Earth. Sixty years earlier, a race of alien scavengers destroyed the Moon and invaded Earth; humanity won the war, but nuclear weapons and the loss of the Moon left most of the planet uninhabitable. With Vika as his communications officer, Jack serves as “Tech 49”, repairing the combat drones that hunt the remaining scavengers and guard the “hydrorig” generators converting seawater into fusion energy. Led by mission director Sally from aboard the “Tet” space station orbiting Earth, they will soon leave for humanity\\'s new home on Titan. Although their memories have been wiped, Jack has recurring dreams of a life before the war with an unknown woman.\\nExploring the ruins of the New York Public Library, Jack narrowly escapes a scavenger ambush. After a hydrorig is destroyed, he discovers the scavengers are using the Empire State Building\\'s antenna to transmit coordinates to outer space. After disabling the transmitter, he visits his secret cabin filled with mementos from Earth\\'s past. An unknown object crash-lands at the transmitted coordinates; in the wreckage, Jack finds five humans in stasis chambers, including the woman from his dreams. Drones kill the hibernating humans, but Jack protects the woman and brings her to his base. He and Vika revive the woman and learn her name is Julia, realizing she was in stasis aboard her ship Odyssey since before the war.\\nJack and Julia return to the crash site and recover Odyssey\\'s flight recorder, but are captured by scavengers and taken to Raven Rock Mountain Complex. Their leader, Malcolm Beech, reveals that the scavengers are humans, disguised to stay hidden from the drones. Another drone attacks, and Beech releases Jack and Julia to discover the truth in the “radiation zone”. Julia reveals she is Jack’s wife, triggering his memories of proposing to her at the Empire State Building.\\nVika sends a craft to retrieve Jack and Julia, but is heartbroken to see them reunited. She alerts Sally, who activates a drone that kills Vika before Julia destroys it. Jack and Julia escape in his craft and destroy the drones pursuing them, but are forced to eject over the radiation zone. Another technician, \"Tech 52\" – revealed to be a clone of Jack – arrives to repair the drones. Jack incapacitates him, but Julia is shot, and Jack flies to his clone\\'s base for medical supplies, tricking a clone of Vika into believing he is \"her\" version of Jack. He takes Julia to his cabin, where she recuperates and they re-consummate their marriage.\\nThey return to the scavenger base, and Beech explains that the Tet is an alien artificial intelligence: determined to acquire Earth\\'s resources and wipe out humanity, it destroyed the Moon and invaded Earth with an army of drones and Jack’s clones; humanity’s victory and escape to Titan is a Tet fiction. Jack reprograms a captured drone to sabotage the Tet, but more drones attack the base, leaving Beech gravely injured and the captured drone damaged beyond repair.\\nJack volunteers to deliver Julia to the Tet, allowing him to infiltrate the space station and detonate Odyssey\\'s nuclear fuel cells. En route, Jack learns the truth from Odyssey\\'s flight recorder: he was the commander of a NASA mission to explore Titan, with Vika as his co-pilot, Julia as a crew member, and Sally as their mission director on Earth. After their ship Odyssey was diverted to investigate the Tet, Jack jettisoned the sleep module, allowing Julia and the hibernating crew to eventually return to Earth, while he and Vika were captured and cloned.\\nIn the present, Jack enters the Tet, finding thousands of clones of himself and Vika in stasis. Confronted by the Tet’s projection of “Sally”, Jack opens the stasis chamber to reveal Beech; Julia was sent safely to the cabin instead. Jack and Beech detonate their bomb, sacrificing themselves to destroy the Tet. Three years later, Julia has given birth to her and Jack’s young daughter. They meet the surviving resistance members, accompanied by Tech 52, who has regained Jack’s true memories.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Jack Harper, Tech 49: A technician who works to repair drones on Earth. Originally, he was the commander of a mission to Titan who was then captured and cloned to fight humanity by the Tet. Cruise also plays Jack Harper, Tech 52, a clone who initially remains loyal to the Tet.\\nMorgan Freeman as Malcolm Beech: A veteran soldier and leader of a large community of \\'scavengers\\', or human survivors from the alien Tet\\'s attacks.\\nOlga Kurylenko as Julia Rusakova Harper: Jack\\'s wife and a crew member on the Odyssey, who was sent to Earth by her husband to protect her from the Tet.\\nAndrea Riseborough as Victoria \"Vika\" Olsen: Jack\\'s communications partner and housemate. Originally, she was the copilot of Jack\\'s mission to Titan who was captured and cloned to assist in the Tet\\'s war on humanity. Riseborough also plays a clone of Vika who Jack misleads in order to obtain medical supplies.\\nNikolaj Coster-Waldau as Sergeant Sykes: The main military commander of Beech\\'s community of scavengers who is skeptical of Jack.\\nMelissa Leo as the Tet/\\'Sally\\': An alien artificial intelligence seeking to acquire Earth\\'s natural resources and wipe out humanity. Sally was the mission director of Jack and Julia\\'s mission to Titan; her likeness was copied by the Tet to serve as its visual/auditory representation.\\nZoë Bell as Kara: A soldier and member of the scavengers.\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nKosinski wanted to film a cinematic adaptation of the graphic novel Oblivion, which he started to co-write with Arvid Nelson for Radical Comics. The novel, however, was never finished, as Kosinski now admits that \"It was just a stage in the project [of film development]\". He explained in an interview with Empire that \"partnership with Radical Comics allowed me to continue working on the story by developing a series of images and continuing to refine the story more over a period of years. Then I basically used all that development as a pitch kit to the studio. So even though we really never released it as an illustrated novel the story is being told as a film, which was always the intention.\"Walt Disney Pictures, which produced Kosinski\\'s previous direction Tron: Legacy, acquired the Oblivion film adaptation rights from Radical Comics and Kosinski after a heated auction in August 2010. The film was a directing vehicle for Kosinski with Barry Levine producing and Jesse Berger as executive producer. Other studios that made bids on the film were Paramount, Fox\\'s Chernin Entertainment and Universal. Disney subsequently released the rights after realizing the PG-rated film they envisioned, in line with their family-oriented reputation, would require too many story changes. Universal Pictures, which had also bid for the original rights, then bought them from Kosinski and Radical Comics and authorized a PG-13 film version.The script for the film was originally written by Kosinski and William Monahan and underwent a first rewrite by Karl Gajdusek. When the film passed into Universal\\'s hands, a final rewrite was done by Michael Arndt, under the pen name \"Michael deBruyn\". Universal was particularly appreciative of the script, saying, \"It\\'s one of the most beautiful scripts we\\'ve ever come across.\"The Bubble Ship operated by Cruise\\'s main character, Jack 49, was inspired by the Bell 47 helicopter (often colloquially referred to as a \"bubble cockpit\" helicopter), a utilitarian 1947 vehicle with a transparent round canopy that Kosinski saw in the lobby of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, and which he likened to a dragonfly. Daniel Simon, who previously worked with Kosinski as the lead vehicle designer on Tron: Legacy, was tasked with creating the Bubble Ship from this basis, incorporating elements evocative of an advanced fighter jet with the Bell 47 to create a light, functional vehicle that was both practical and aesthetically pleasing, much as he observed with the ships in 2001: A Space Odyssey.\"When Kubrick made 2001, rather than going to the hotshot concept designers of the day, he hired NASA engineers\", said Simon. \"I believe in form follows function. I\\'m not a fan of excessive decoration, of putting fins on something because it looks cool\". Rather than employ digital models, Wild Factory, a Camarillo concept car company, built the Bubble Ship as a 25-foot-long (7.6 m), 4,000–5,000 lb (1,800–2,300 kg), mostly aluminum prop. Elements of the cockpit, such as the placement of the joystick and pedals, were customized for Cruise, who is a qualified pilot, and who had some input into the design. The craft was also made to be easy to disassemble and assemble, in order to facilitate transport to the Iceland shooting locations, where it would be mounted on a gimbal for shots of it flying. The unmanned aerial drones that figure prominently in the plot were created to appear to be in the same design family as the Bubble Ship.\\n\\nCasting\\nTom Cruise had expressed interest in the film for a long time, and officially committed to it on May 20, 2011.For casting the lead role of Julia opposite Cruise, the producers considered five actresses: Jessica Chastain, Olivia Wilde, Brit Marling, Noomi Rapace and Olga Kurylenko, and all five auditioned on August 27, 2011. It was subsequently announced that Chastain would play one of the film\\'s two female leads. In January 2012 Chastain entered into talks for a part in the Kathryn Bigelow film Zero Dark Thirty and subsequently dropped out of Oblivion contention. It was later announced that the role had been given to Kurylenko.In preparation for the role, Kurylenko watched astronaut training videos as well as classic science fiction and romance films (such as Solaris, Notorious, and Casablanca). \"What\\'s funny is I actually watched Solaris; Joseph never brought it up\", said Kurylenko. \"I come from Tarkovsky-land, and at that point I hadn\\'t watched it for many years. I watched the new one as well, with George Clooney and Natascha McElhone. The story – both in Solaris and Oblivion – deals with space and memory.\"For the other leading role, Victoria, the producers initially considered Hayley Atwell, Diane Kruger and Kate Beckinsale. The three actresses traveled to Pittsburgh to screen-test with Cruise, who was filming Jack Reacher. The role finally went to Andrea Riseborough. Melissa Leo was cast at a later date as Sally.\\n\\nFilming\\nProduction began on March 12, 2012, and concluded on July 14, 2012. Filming locations included Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana. Out of approximately three months of shooting, 69 days were shot in Louisiana, from March through May 2012, 11 days were shot in New York in June 2012, a few in Mammoth in California in June 2012, and 10 days were filmed in Iceland in June 2012, when the daylight lasts for nearly 24 hours a day. As well as showcasing Iceland\\'s volcanic landscapes, the film\\'s director Joseph Kosinski sought to take advantage of the round-the-clock light, in particular the 6pm to 1am waning light known as \"magic hour\", to \"bring sci-fi out into the daylight\", in contrast with films such as Alien, which spent their time in dark hulls or benighted planets.The single most difficult scene to film was when Harper takes a break to admire the view and waters a flower. It was filmed by having Cruise sit next to an 800-foot (240-meter) drop at the top of Iceland\\'s Jarlhettur on the root of Langjökull, which is accessible only by helicopter. The scenes set at Harper\\'s idyllic forest retreat were filmed at Black\\'s Pond in June Lake, California.Oblivion was filmed with Sony\\'s CineAlta F65 camera, which was shipped in January 2012. A Red Epic was also used for scenes that required going handheld or when body mount rigging was applied. The film was shot in 4K resolution in Sony\\'s proprietary raw image format, but for cost reasons (and over Kosinski\\'s protests), both the digital intermediate and final version were done at 2K resolution.For the Sky Tower set (built on a soundstage in Baton Rouge), Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda worked closely with visual special-effects house Pixomondo to establish both environment and lighting by the use of 21 front-screen projectors aimed at a huge wraparound backdrop to form one continuous image, rather than blue screen backdrops. The backdrop consisted of a single seamless piece of painted white muslin, 500 by 42 feet (152 by 13 meters), which was wrapped around the set for 270-degree coverage. This enabled the full environment to be captured in camera, and assisted in lighting up to 90 percent of the set.Had blue screen been used on the \"glass house\" Sky Tower, the glass would have disappeared into the blue lighting, and would have had to be reproduced digitally in post-production. The actors enjoyed working in the environment, as they could look outside and actually see sunrise or sunset imagery. This new technique allowed them to cut down on both the effects shots, which ended up at around 800 in total, and the expenses. Even the \"control table\" which Victoria operates was filmed then displayed on a large screen.To obtain the necessary footage to create the illusion that the Sky Tower set was sitting high above the clouds, Pixomondo sent a crew to film the view from the peak of Haleakalā in Hawaii for four days with three Red Epic cameras mounted side-by-side on a single rig. Pixomondo\\'s Stuttgart office then stitched together the data from the three cameras to form a single gigantic video stream (with each still image consisting of 26 megapixels), and produced a variety of different time-of-day clips to be projected on the set.\\n\\nMusic\\nOn June 28, 2012, it was announced that French electronic band M83 would compose the soundtrack for Oblivion. On why he chose M83 to score the film, director Joseph Kosinski said, \"I went back and I found my first treatment for Oblivion from 2005 and it had listed in the treatment a soundtrack of M83. Obviously the Tron: Legacy collaboration with Daft Punk worked out as good as I would have ever hoped, [so] I wanted to do something similar in that I\\'m pulling an artist from outside the movie business to create an original sound for this film.\" Kosinski continued, \"Daft Punk\\'s music wouldn\\'t make sense for this movie. It had to be an artist whose music fit the themes and story I was trying to tell. And M83\\'s music I felt was fresh and original, and big and epic, but at the same time emotional and this is a very emotional film and it felt like a good fit.\"To guide Anthony Gonzalez of M83 through the scoring process, director Kosinski brought in Joseph Trapanese, who co-wrote the score alongside Gonzalez. Kosinski states, \"Together they have created the score that I have dreamed about since I first put this story down on paper eight years ago.\" Trapanese first came to Kosinski\\'s attention when he collaborated with Daft Punk on Tron: Legacy as arranger and orchestrator.In an interview with Rolling Stone, M83 frontman Anthony Gonzalez said, \"I started to write the soundtrack just reading the script, and then when you get the picture in, it\\'s different, and you kind of switch to another vibe and change stuff and start experimenting a lot with the music.\" Gonzalez added, \"I worked with Joseph a lot, and he\\'s very particular about the music in his movies, so we spent a lot of time talking about music and working the arrangements together.\"\\nThe soundtrack album was released on April 9, 2013, by Back Lot Music. A deluxe edition of the soundtrack was released the same day exclusively through iTunes. It features an additional 13 tracks.Track listing\\n\\nAll music is composed by Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese. \"Oblivion\" lyrics written by Gonzalez and Susanne Sundfør.\\n\\nDistribution\\nMarketing\\nDetails about Oblivion were kept secret, though the studio was said to have been \"very excited\" about the film. Promotions began April 2012, with a part of the footage being screened at the 2012 CinemaCon despite the fact that filming had begun just one month prior to the event. The footage was described as \"a combination of early concept art, rough animation, and unfinished dailies\", showcasing a glimpse of the film\\'s landscapes.\\n\\nTheatrical release\\nOblivion was first presented in Buenos Aires on March 26, 2013, Dublin on April 3, and in Hollywood on April 10 at the Dolby Theatre where Cruise himself announced before the screening that the film was actually the first feature to be mixed completely \"from start to finish\" in the latest state-of-the-art Dolby Atmos surround sound.\\n\\nHome media\\nThe DVD and Blu-ray for Oblivion became available online for pre-order in North America on April 24, 2013, just five days after its initial release in the region. One month later it was announced that the United Kingdom branch of Universal Studios would be releasing the film on home video in its region on August 6, 2013 with the on-demand version on August 18, 2013. The release was scheduled to be in both a standard and a SteelBook Limited Edition form. In June 2013, it was announced that the film would be released on home video in America also on August 6, 2013. The Blu-ray releases will feature commentary with Tom Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski, deleted scenes, M83\\'s isolated score, and a series of making-of featurettes. The Blu-ray debuted at number 1 in sales for its opening week.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nIn North America, the film earned US$37.1 million on its opening weekend, including US$5.5 million from IMAX screenings in 323 theaters, making it Cruise\\'s best North American opening after Mission: Impossible film series and War of the Worlds.The film closed on June 27, 2013. Oblivion grossed US$89.1 million in the U.S. and US$198.8 million internationally, bringing the worldwide total to US$287.9 million.\\n\\nCritical response\\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 53% based on 255 reviews, with an average score of 5.88/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Visually striking but thinly scripted, Oblivion benefits greatly from its strong production values and an excellent performance from Tom Cruise.\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter stated \"Oblivion is an absolutely gorgeous film dramatically caught between its aspirations for poetic romanticism and the demands of heavy sci-fi action\". Justin Chang of Variety said \"Insofar as Oblivion is first and foremost a visual experience, a movie to be seen rather than a puzzle to be deciphered, its chief pleasures are essentially spoiler-proof.\" Kevin Harley of Total Film gave the film three stars and said \"It isn\\'t a reboot or reimagining, refreshingly, but Oblivion plays like a stylised remix of superior sci-fi ground-breakers\". Andrew O\\'Hehir of Salon praised it as a \"sly, surprising and visually magnificent Tom Cruise vehicle that has forced me – and many other people, I suspect – to revise my first opinion of director Joseph Kosinski.\"Tasha Robinson from The A.V. Club states that an \"unsettling sense of not-quite-right coats all of the film\\'s steely surfaces, and Kosinski and his co-writers give audiences plenty of time to absorb the unease and gear up for the action\". Some reviewers noted the filmmakers\\' ambition. James Berardinelli of ReelViews calls the film \"imperfect but some of its imperfections result from being overly ambitious\". Bill Goodykoontz from the Arizona Republic states that the film \"may not live up fully to its grand ambitions, but it isn\\'t for lack of trying\". Jake Coyle of the Associated Press states that \"[f]or those who enjoy the simple thrill of handsomely stylized image-making, Oblivion is mostly mesmerizing.\" Alan Scherstuhl from the Village Voice states that \"Kosinski proves himself talented in ways his Tron: Legacy didn\\'t suggest.\"Kenneth Turan from the Los Angeles Times called the film \"[m]ore adventurous than your typical Hollywood tent pole, Oblivion makes you remember why science fiction movies pulled you in way back when and didn\\'t let you go.\" Michael O\\'Sullivan of the Washington Post states that \"[i]f you\\'re able to forgive and forget, Oblivion isn\\'t a bad place to start loving Tom Cruise all over again.\" Steven Rea of the Philadelphia Inquirer states that \"[Cruise] oversees some pretty impressive stuff here, from the drones that ping-pong around in the air to the bubbleship that Jack uses to go to and fro to that awesome house with its panoramic views.\" Peter Howell of the Toronto Star states that the film \"gives us stars in the cast, stars in our eyes and it even tweaks a brain cell or three\".Colin Covert from the Minneapolis Star Tribune states that the \"film is rife with elements from its finest predecessors – Kubrick, Lucas, the Wachowskis and Pixar could be listed as creative consultants – but it has the spirit of a love letter to classic sci-fi, not an opportunistic mash-up\". Cary Darling of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram states that the film is \"stitched together from spare bits of other, often better films, stumbl[ing] awkwardly in story and plot, shuffling toward the predictable explosions and fireballs of the third act. Yet... Oblivion is so beautiful to look at.\"Richard Corliss of TIME stated that \"[i]n space, Jack [Harper] hopes, someone may hear you dream. But in a movie theater, no one will see you yawn.\" Anthony Lane of The New Yorker states that the film \"[f]eels ever more grounded and stuck.\" Richard Roeper of Richard Roeper.com called it the \"sci-fi movie equivalent of a pretty damn good cover band\". Tom Charity of CNN.com called it \"[g]lossy, derivative, ambitious and fatally underpowered.\" J. R. Jones of the Chicago Reader states that the \"story eventually devolves into a grab bag of sci-fi tropes but, as with so many other Cruise productions, the sheer scale of everything is so mind-numbing that you may not notice\". Rick Groen of Canada\\'s The Globe and Mail called it \"an okay blockbuster, a multimillion-dollar exercise in competence\".Tom Long of the Detroit News states that \"Kosinski offers plenty of action here, and he lets the plot reveals bleed out slowly (explanations keep coming right to the end).\" Long states that \"a great deal is derivative, but it\\'s fast-moving derivative\". Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger states that the movie \"combines a lot of different films, yet somehow remains less than the sum of its parts\". Claudia Puig of USA Today states that \"Kosinski focuses on cool visuals but stints on a compelling plot. It\\'s a dazzler, but the story lacks the impact of the futuristic look.\" Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal states that the \"mystery posed by Oblivion as a whole is why its mysteries are posed so clumsily, and worked out so murkily\".Manohla Dargis of The New York Times states that the \"agony of being a longtime Tom Cruise fan has always been a burden, but now it\\'s just, well, dispiriting\". Rafer Guzman of Newsday states that \"[p]laying spot-the-influence is the most fun you\\'ll have during this expensive-looking, slow-moving plod through familiar territory.\" Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch states that \"[i]nstead of developing characters, Kosinski pours most of his imagination into the annihilated landscapes and futuristic gadgetry.\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune states that \"[w]hen you go to a futuristic, dystopian, post-apocalyptic barn dance starring Tom Cruise and his space guns, you expect a little zap with your thoughtful pauses.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone calls it \"arid and antiseptic, untouched by human hands\".Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald states that the \"filmmakers don\\'t even have the courage to see the story to its proper end, opting for a ridiculous finale that feels vaguely insulting\". Soren Anderson from the Seattle Times states that \"[y]ou start wondering whether director Joseph Kosinski and screenwriters Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn have any original ideas of their own. And then you realize they don\\'t.\" Randy Myers of the San Jose Mercury News states that the \"mix of gee-whiz gadgetry and the day-to-day routineness of Jack and Victoria\\'s lives is interesting enough, but the film is too glacially paced for it to work\". Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly states that \"[a]ll the eye candy in the world can\\'t mask the sensation that you\\'ve seen this all before...and done better. Too bad the movie\\'s script wasn\\'t given the same attention as its sleek, brave-new-world look.\"\\n\\nSee also\\nList of films featuring drones\\nList of dystopian films\\nList of films featuring space stations\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOblivion at IMDb\\nOblivion at the TCM Movie Database\\nOblivion at AllMovie\\nOblivion at Rotten Tomatoes\\nOblivion at the American Film Institute Catalog\\nOblivion at Box Office Mojo\\nOblivion at Metacritic',\n",
              " 'Paul Newman': 'Paul Leonard Newman (January 26, 1925 – September 26, 2008) was an American actor, film director, race car driver, and entrepreneur. He was the recipient of  numerous awards, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, three Golden Globe Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, the Cecil B. DeMille Award, and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.Born in Shaker Heights, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, Newman showed an interest in theater as a child and at age 10 performed in a stage production of Saint George and the Dragon at the Cleveland Play House. He served in the United States Navy during 1943–46 and spent time in the Pacific Theater of World War II. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in drama and economics from Kenyon College in 1949. After touring with several summer stock companies including the Belfry Players, Newman attended the Yale School of Drama for a year before studying at the Actors Studio under Lee Strasberg. His first starring Broadway role was in William Inge\\'s Picnic, and he starred in smaller roles for a few more films before receiving widespread attention and acclaim for his performances in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956) and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), the latter of which also starred Elizabeth Taylor. \\nNewman\\'s major film roles include The Hustler (1961), Hud (1963), Harper (1966), Cool Hand Luke (1967), Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972), and leading roles in The Sting (1973), The Towering Inferno (1974), Slap Shot (1977), The Verdict (1982), and voice role of Doc Hudson in the first installment of Disney-Pixar\\'s Cars as his final acting performance, with his archival voice recordings being used again in Cars 3 (2017), nine years after his death. A ten-time Oscar nominee, Newman was awarded an Academy Award for Best Actor for The Color of Money (1986). \\nNewman won several national championships as a driver in Sports Car Club of America road racing, and his race teams won several championships in open-wheel IndyCar racing. He was a co-founder of Newman\\'s Own, a food company from which he donated all post-tax profits and royalties to charity. As of July 2019, these donations have totaled over US$550 million. He was a co-founder of Safe Water Network, a nonprofit that develops sustainable drinking water solutions for those in need.In 1988, Newman founded the SeriousFun Children\\'s Network, a global family of summer camps and programs for children with a serious illness which has served 290,076 children since its inception. In 2006, Paul Newman also co-founded Safe Water Network with John Whitehead, former chairman of Goldman Sachs, and Josh Weston, former chairman of ADP, to improve access to safe water to underserved communities around the world. He was the husband of Oscar-winning actress Joanne Woodward.\\n\\nEarly life\\nNewman was born January 26, 1925, in Shaker Heights, Ohio, the second son of Theresa Garth (née Fetzer, Fetzko, or Fetsko; Slovak: Terézia Fecková; 1894–1982) and Arthur Sigmund Newman Sr. (1893–1950), who ran a sporting goods store. His father was Jewish, the son of Simon Newman and Hannah Cohn, Hungarian Jewish and Polish Jewish emigrants from Hungary and Vistula Land. Paul\\'s mother was a practitioner of Christian Science. She was born to a Slovak Roman Catholic family in Peticse (near Homonna) in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (present-day Ptičie near Humenné, Slovakia). Newman practised no religion as an adult, but described himself as a Jew, saying \"it\\'s more of a challenge\". Newman\\'s mother worked in his father\\'s store, while raising Paul and his elder brother, Arthur.Newman showed an early interest in the theater; his first role was at the age of seven, playing the court jester in a school production of Robin Hood. At age 10, Newman performed at the Cleveland Play House in a production of Saint George and the Dragon, and was a notable actor and alumnus of their Curtain Pullers children\\'s theater program. Graduating from Shaker Heights High School in 1943, he briefly attended Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, where he was initiated into the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity.Newman served in the United States Navy in World War II in the Pacific theater. Initially, he enrolled in the Navy V-12 pilot training program at Yale University, but was dropped when his colorblindness was discovered. Boot camp followed, with training as a radioman and rear gunner. Qualifying in torpedo bombers in 1944, Aviation Radioman Third Class Newman was sent to Barbers Point, Hawaii. He was subsequently assigned to Pacific-based replacement torpedo squadrons VT-98, VT-99, and VT-100, responsible primarily for training replacement combat pilots and aircrewmen, with special emphasis on carrier landings. He later flew as a turret gunner in an Avenger torpedo bomber. As a radioman-gunner, his unit was assigned to the aircraft carrier Bunker Hill along with other replacements shortly before the Battle of Okinawa in the spring of 1945. The pilot of his aircraft had an earache and was grounded as was his crew, including Newman. The rest of their squadron flew to the Bunker Hill. Days later, a kamikaze attack on the vessel killed a number of service members, including other members of his unit.After the war, Newman completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in drama and economics at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio in 1949. Shortly after earning his degree, he joined several summer stock companies, most notably the Belfry Players in Wisconsin and the Woodstock Players in Illinois. He toured with them for three months and developed his talents as a part of Woodstock Players. He later attended the Yale School of Drama for one year, before moving to New York City to study under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Oscar Levant wrote that Newman initially was hesitant to leave New York for Hollywood, and that Newman had said, \"Too close to the cake. Also, no place to study.\"\\n\\nCareer\\nNewman arrived in New York City in 1951 with his first wife, Jackie Witte, taking up residence in the St. George section of Staten Island.He made his Broadway theater debut in the original production of William Inge\\'s Picnic with Kim Stanley in 1953 and appeared in the original Broadway production of The Desperate Hours in 1955. In 1959, he was in the original Broadway production of Sweet Bird of Youth with Geraldine Page and three years later starred with Page in the film version. During this time Newman started acting in television. His first credited role was in a 1952 episode of Tales of Tomorrow entitled \"Ice from Space\". In the mid-1950s, he appeared twice on CBS\\'s Appointment with Adventure anthology series.\\nIn February 1954, Newman appeared in a screen test with James Dean, directed by Gjon Mili, for East of Eden (1955). Newman was tested for the role of Aron Trask, Dean for the role of Aron\\'s twin brother Cal. Dean won his part, but Newman lost out to Richard Davalos. That same year, as a last-minute replacement for Dean, he co-starred with Eva Marie Saint and Frank Sinatra in a live, color television broadcast of Our Town which was a musical adaptation of Thornton Wilder\\'s stage play. After Dean\\'s death, Newman replaced Dean, in the role of a boxer in a television adaptation of Hemingway\\'s story \"The Battler\", written by A. E. Hotchner, that was broadcast live on October 18, 1955. That performance led to his breakthrough role as Rocky Graziano in the film Somebody Up There Likes Me in 1956. The Dean connection had additional resonance. Newman was cast as Billy the Kid in The Left Handed Gun which was a  role originally earmarked for Dean. Additionally, Dean was originally cast to play the role of Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me; however, with his death, Paul Newman inherited the role.Newman\\'s first film for Hollywood was The Silver Chalice (1954). The film was a box-office failure, and the actor would later acknowledge his disdain for it. In 1956, Newman garnered much attention and acclaim for the role of Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me. In 1958, he starred in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), opposite Elizabeth Taylor. The film was a box-office smash, and Newman garnered his first Academy Award nomination. Also in 1958, Newman starred in The Long, Hot Summer with Joanne Woodward, with whom he reconnected on the set in 1957 (they had first met in 1953). He won Best Actor at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival for this film.\\n\\nMajor films\\nNewman starred in The Young Philadelphians (1959), a drama film which co-starred Barbara Rush, Robert Vaughn and Alexis Smith, and was directed by Vincent Sherman. The film was based on the 1956 novel, The Philadelphian, by Richard P. Powell.\\n\\nHe followed up with leads in Exodus (1960), From the Terrace, (1960), The Hustler (1961), Hud (1963), Torn Curtain (1966), Harper (1966), Hombre (1967), Cool Hand Luke (1967), The Towering Inferno (1974), Slap Shot (1977), Absence of Malice (1981), The Verdict (1982) and Nobody\\'s Fool (1994). He teamed up with fellow actor Robert Redford and director George Roy Hill for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and The Sting (1973). After his marriage to Woodward they appeared together in The Long, Hot Summer (1958), Rally \\'Round the Flag, Boys!, (1958), From the Terrace (1960), Paris Blues (1961), A New Kind of Love (1963), Winning (1969), WUSA (1970), playing Harper for a 2nd time in The Drowning Pool (1975), Slap Shot (1977) Harry & Son (1984), and Mr. and Mrs. Bridge (1990). They starred in the HBO miniseries Empire Falls, but did not share any scenes.\\n\\nIn addition to starring in and directing Harry & Son, Newman directed four feature films starring Woodward. They were Rachel, Rachel (1968), based on Margaret Laurence\\'s A Jest of God, the screen version of the Pulitzer Prize–winning play The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds (1972), the television screen version of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play The Shadow Box (1980), and a screen version of Tennessee Williams\\' The Glass Menagerie (1987). Twenty-five years after The Hustler, Newman reprised his role of \"Fast Eddie\" Felson in the Martin Scorsese–directed film The Color of Money (1986), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Some deemed this to be a weak rinse of the original Felson role and the Academy Award as an honorary tribute to a portfolio of Oscar-nominated roles that had not won at the time but were more deserving. In 1994 Newman played alongside Tim Robbins as the character \"Sidney J. Mussburger\" in the Coen Brothers comedy The Hudsucker Proxy.\\n\\n21st century roles\\nIn 2003, Newman appeared in a Broadway revival of Wilder\\'s Our Town, receiving his first Tony Award nomination for his performance. PBS and the cable network Showtime aired a taping of the production, and Newman was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie.\\nNewman\\'s last movie appearance was as a conflicted mob boss in the 2002 film Road to Perdition opposite Tom Hanks, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His last appearance overall, although he continued to provide voice work for films, was in 2005 in the HBO mini-series Empire Falls (based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Richard Russo) in which he played the dissolute father of the protagonist, Miles Roby, and for which he won a Golden Globe and a Primetime Emmy. In 2006, in keeping with his strong interest in car racing, he provided the voice of Doc Hudson, a retired anthropomorphic race car, in Disney/Pixar\\'s Cars – this was his final role for a major feature film. While not in the second film Cars 2 (2011), his voice was later used in the third film, (which was done through the use of archive recordings) Cars 3 (2017), for which he received billing, almost nine years after his death.\\n\\nNewman retired from acting in May 2007, saying \"You start to lose your memory, you start to lose your confidence, you start to lose your invention. So I think that\\'s pretty much a closed book for me.\" He came out of retirement to record narration for the 2007 documentary Dale, about the life of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, and for the 2008 documentary The Meerkats.\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nWith writer A. E. Hotchner, Newman founded Newman\\'s Own, a line of food products, in 1982. The brand started with salad dressing and has expanded to include pasta sauce, lemonade, popcorn, salsa, and wine, among other things. Newman established a policy that all proceeds, after taxes, would be donated to charity. He co-wrote a memoir about the subject with Hotchner, Shameless Exploitation in Pursuit of the Common Good. Among other awards, Newman\\'s Own co-sponsors the PEN/Newman\\'s Own First Amendment Award, a $25,000 reward designed to recognize those who protect the First Amendment as it applies to the written word.One beneficiary of his philanthropy is the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a residential summer camp for seriously ill children located in Ashford, Connecticut, which Newman co-founded in 1988. It is named after the gang in his film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), and the real-life, historic Hole-in-the-Wall outlaw hangout in the mountains of northern Wyoming. Newman\\'s college fraternity, Phi Kappa Tau, adopted his Connecticut Hole in the Wall camp as their \"national philanthropy\" in 1995. The original camp has expanded to become several Hole in the Wall Camps in the U.S., Ireland, France, and Israel.In 1983, Newman became a Major Donor for The Mirror Theater Ltd, alongside Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino, matching a grant from Laurence Rockefeller. Newman was inspired to invest by his connection with Lee Strasberg, as Lee\\'s then daughter-in-law Sabra Jones was the Founder and Producing Artistic Director of The Mirror. Paul Newman remained a friend of the company until his death and discussed at numerous times possible productions in which he could star with his wife, Joanne Woodward.\\nIn June 1999, Newman donated $250,000 to Catholic Relief Services to aid refugees in Kosovo.On June 1, 2007, Kenyon College announced that Newman had donated $10 million to the school to establish a scholarship fund as part of the college\\'s $230 million fund-raising campaign. Newman and Woodward were honorary co-chairs of a previous campaign.Newman was one of the founders of the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy (CECP).\\nNewman was named the Most Generous Celebrity of 2008 by Givingback.org. He contributed $20,857,000 for the year of 2008 to the Newman\\'s Own Foundation, which distributes funds to a variety of charities.Upon Newman\\'s death, the Italian newspaper (a \"semi-official\" paper of the Holy See) L\\'Osservatore Romano published a notice lauding Newman\\'s philanthropy. It also commented that \"Newman was a generous heart, an actor of a dignity and style rare in Hollywood quarters.\"Newman was responsible for preserving lands around Westport, Connecticut. He lobbied the state\\'s governor for funds for the 2011 Aspetuck Land Trust in Easton. In 2011 Paul Newman\\'s estate gifted land to Westport to be managed by the Aspetuck Land Trust.\\n\\nPolitical activism\\nNewman was a lifelong Democrat, although he endorsed and voted for Independent candidate John B. Anderson in 1980, who was a liberal Republican, instead of the incumbent Democratic president, Jimmy Carter. For Newman\\'s support of Eugene McCarthy in 1968 (and effective use of television commercials in California) and his opposition to the Vietnam War, Newman was placed nineteenth on Richard Nixon\\'s enemies list, which Newman claimed was his greatest accomplishment. During the 1968 general election, Newman supported Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey and appeared in a pre-election night telethon for him.  He was also described as a “vocal supporter” of gay rights and same-sex marriage.Newman linked with the so-called Malibu Mafia to promote progressive issues in politics. This was a group of wealthy men in the Greater Los Angeles area who met to discuss politics. Backed by them, Newman and his wife went to Washington in 1976 to speak in favor of breaking up Big Oil into separate components. Newman supported their 1980s effort to establish a bilateral Nuclear Freeze to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the US and the Soviet Union. He said he would stand up for Walter Mondale in the 1984 presidential election as long as there was cold Budweiser and Nuclear Freeze involved.In January 1995, Newman was the chief investor of a group, including the writer E.L. Doctorow and the editor Victor Navasky, that bought the progressive-left wing periodical The Nation. Newman was an occasional writer for the publication.Consistent with his work for liberal causes, Newman publicly supported Ned Lamont\\'s candidacy in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic Primary against Senator Joe Lieberman, and was even rumored as a candidate himself, until Lamont emerged as a credible alternative. He donated to Chris Dodd\\'s presidential campaign. Newman earlier donated money to Bill Richardson\\'s campaign for president in 2008.\\nNewman attended the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, and was also present at the first Earth Day event in Manhattan on April 22, 1970.Newman was concerned about global warming and supported nuclear energy development as a solution.\\n\\nAuto racing\\nNewman was an auto racing enthusiast, and first became interested in motorsports (\"the first thing that I ever found I had any grace in\") while training at the Watkins Glen Racing School for the filming of Winning, a 1969 film. Because of his love and passion for racing, Newman agreed in 1971 to star in and to host his first television special, Once Upon a Wheel, on the history of auto racing. It was produced and directed by David Winters, who co-owned a number of racing cars with Newman. Newman\\'s first professional event as a racer was in 1972 at Thompson International Speedway, quietly entered as \"P. L. Newman\", by which he continued to be known in the racing community.He was a frequent competitor in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) events for the rest of the decade, eventually winning four national championships. He later drove in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans in Dick Barbour\\'s Porsche 935 and finished in second place. Newman reunited with Barbour in 2000 to compete in the Petit Le Mans.From the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, he drove for the Bob Sharp Racing team, racing mainly Datsuns (later rebranded as Nissans) in the Trans-Am Series. He became closely associated with the brand during the 1980s, even appearing in commercials for them in Japan and having a special edition of the Nissan Skyline named after him. At the age of 70 years and eight days, Newman became the oldest driver to date to be part of a winning team in a major sanctioned race, winning in his class at the 1995 24 Hours of Daytona. Among his last major races were the Baja 1000 in 2004 and the 24 Hours of Daytona once again in 2005.\\n\\nDuring the 1976 auto racing season, Newman became interested in forming a professional auto racing team and contacted Bill Freeman who introduced Newman to professional auto racing management, and their company specialized in Can-Am, Indy Cars, and other high-performance racing automobiles. The team was based in Santa Barbara, California and commuted to Willow Springs International Motorsports Park for much of its testing sessions.\\nTheir Newman Freeman Racing team was very competitive in the North American Can-Am series in their Budweiser sponsored Chevrolet-powered Spyder NFs. Newman and Freeman began a long and successful partnership with the Newman Freeman Racing team in the Can-Am series which culminated in the Can-Am Team Championship trophy in 1979. Newman was associated with Freeman\\'s established Porsche racing team which allowed both Newman and Freeman to compete in SCCA and IMSA racing events together, including the Sebring 12-hour endurance sports car race. This car was sponsored by Beverly Porsche/Audi. Freeman was Sports Car Club of America\\'s Southern Pacific National Champion during the Newman Freeman Racing period. Later Newman co-founded Newman/Haas Racing with Carl Haas, a Champ Car team, in 1983, going on to win eight drivers\\' championships under his ownership. The 1996 racing season was chronicled in the IMAX film Super Speedway (1997), which Newman narrated. He was a partner in the Atlantic Championship team Newman Wachs Racing. Newman voiced Doc Hudson in Cars (2006).\\nHaving said he would quit \"when I embarrass myself\", Newman competed into his 80s, winning at Lime Rock in what former co-driver Sam Posey called a \"brutish Corvette\" displaying his age as its number: 81. He took the pole in his last professional race, in 2007 at Watkins Glen International, and in a 2008 run at Lime Rock, arranged by friends, he reportedly still did 9/10ths of his best time.Newman was posthumously inducted into the SCCA Hall of Fame at the national convention in Las Vegas, Nevada on February 21, 2009.Newman\\'s racing life was chronicled in the documentary Winning: The Racing Life of Paul Newman (2015).\\n\\nMotorsports career results\\nSCCA National Championship Runoffs\\nComplete 24 Hours of Le Mans results\\n(key)\\n\\nPersonal life\\nNewman was married twice. His first marriage was to Jackie Witte from 1949 to 1958. They had a son, Scott (1950–1978), and two daughters, Susan (born 1953) and Stephanie Kendall (born 1954). Scott, who appeared in films including Breakheart Pass, The Towering Inferno, and the 1977 film Fraternity Row, died in November 1978 from a drug overdose. Newman started the Scott Newman Center for drug abuse prevention in memory of his son. Susan is a documentary filmmaker and philanthropist, and has Broadway and screen credits, including a starring role as one of four Beatles fans in I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978), and also a small role opposite her father in Slap Shot. She also received an Emmy nomination as co-producer of his telefilm, The Shadow Box.\\nNewman met actress Joanne Woodward in 1953, on the production of Picnic on Broadway. It was Newman\\'s debut; Woodward was an understudy. Shortly after filming The Long, Hot Summer in 1957, he divorced Witte to marry Woodward. They married early in 1958. The Newmans moved to 11th Street in Manhattan, before buying a home and starting a family in Westport, Connecticut. They were one of the first Hollywood movie star couples to choose to raise their families outside California. They remained married for 50 years until his death in 2008. Woodward has said \"He\\'s very good looking and very sexy and all of those things, but all of that goes out the window and what is finally left is, if you can make somebody laugh... And he sure does keep me laughing.\" Newman has attributed their relationship success to \"some combination of lust and respect and patience. And determination.\"They had three daughters: Elinor \"Nell\" Teresa (b. 1959), Melissa \"Lissy\" Stewart (b. 1961), and Claire \"Clea\" Olivia (b. 1965). Newman was well known for his devotion to his wife and family. When once asked about his reputation for fidelity, he famously quipped, \"Why go out for a hamburger when you have steak at home?\" He also said that he never met anyone who had as much to lose as he did. In his profile on 60 Minutes, he admitted he once left Woodward after a fight, walked around the outside of the house, knocked on the front door and explained to Joanne he had nowhere to go. Newman directed Nell alongside her mother in the films Rachel, Rachel and The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds. Newman and Woodward also acted as mentors to Allison Janney. They met her while she was a freshman at Kenyon College during a play which Newman was directing.Film critic Shawn Levy, in his biography Paul Newman: A Life (2009), alleged that Newman had an affair in the late 1960s with divorcée Nancy Bacon, a Hollywood journalist, which lasted one and a half years. In an article in the Irish Independent- which stated also that Levy\\'s claims \"caused outrage\" and were widely considered \"an attempt to sully the image of a revered cinematic legend and committed philanthropist\"- the affair was reportedly denied by a friend of Newman\\'s wife Joanne, who said she was upset by the claim. Levy criticised the tabloid newspaper The New York Post, which had a long-standing feud with Newman, for focusing on and emphasising this aspect of his biography.Newman was an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church.\\n\\nIllness and death\\nNewman was scheduled to make his professional stage directing debut with the Westport Country Playhouse\\'s 2008 production of John Steinbeck\\'s Of Mice and Men, but he stepped down on May 23, 2008, citing his health concerns.In June 2008, it was widely reported in the press that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer and was receiving treatment for the condition at the Sloan-Kettering hospital in New York City. A. E. Hotchner, who partnered in the 1980s with Newman to start Newman\\'s Own, told the Associated Press in an interview in mid-2008 that Newman had told him about being afflicted with the disease about 18 months earlier. Newman\\'s spokesman told the press that the star was \"doing nicely\", but neither confirmed nor denied that he had cancer. The actor was a heavy cigarette smoker until he quit in 1986.Newman died on the morning of September 26, 2008, surrounded by friends and family. He was 83 years old. \\nNewman was cremated after a private funeral service near his home in Westport, Connecticut.\\n\\nFilmography\\nPartial theater credits\\nPhaedra by Jean Racine and Robert Collington Ackart – Yale, 1951\\nBeethoven by Dorothy B.

The other nominees are Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, and Jack Nicholson.In addition to the awards Newman won for specific roles, he received an honorary Academy Award in 1986 for his \"many and memorable and compelling screen performances\" and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his charity work in 1994.In 1992, Newman and his wife, Joanne Woodward, were recipients of Kennedy Center Honors.In 1994, Newman and his wife received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.Newman won Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival for The Long, Hot Summer and the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival for Nobody\\'s Fool.In 1968, Newman was named Man of the Year by Harvard University\\'s performance group, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals.The 2008 Edition of Sport Movies & TV – Milano International FICTS Fest was dedicated to his memory.In 2015, the U.S. Postal Service issued a \\'forever stamp\\' honoring Newman, which went on sale September 18, 2015. It features a 1980 photograph of Newman by photographer Steve Schapiro, accompanied by text that reads: \\'Actor/Philanthropist\\'.Since the 1970s, an event called Newman Day has been celebrated at Kenyon College, Bates College, Princeton University, and other American colleges. On Newman Day, students try to drink 24 beers in 24 hours, based on a quote attributed to Newman about there being 24 beers in a case, and 24 hours in a day, and that this is surely not a mere coincidence. In 2004, Newman requested that Princeton University disassociate the event from his name, due to the fact that he did not endorse the behavior, citing his creation in 1980 of the Scott Newman Centre, \"dedicated to the prevention of substance abuse through education\". Princeton disavowed any responsibility for the event, responding that Newman Day is not sponsored, endorsed, or encouraged by the university itself and is solely an unofficial event among students.On October 26, 2017, Paul Newman\\'s Rolex Daytona was auctioned in New York by Phillips Auctions for $17.5 million, making it one of the most expensive wristwatches ever sold in an auction.\\n\\nBibliography\\nNewman, Paul; Hotchner, A.E.

              " 'Paul Thomas Anderson': 'Paul Thomas Anderson (born June 26, 1970) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. Born in Los Angeles, Anderson developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. He made his feature-film debut with Hard Eight (1996). He found critical and commercial success with Boogie Nights (1997), set in the Golden Age of Porn, and received further accolades with Magnolia (1999), an ensemble piece set in the San Fernando Valley, and Punch-Drunk Love (2002), a romantic comedy-drama film.\\nAnderson\\'s 2007 film There Will Be Blood, about an oil prospector during the Southern California oil boom, achieved major critical and commercial success, and is often cited as one of the greatest films of the 2000s. This was followed by The Master (2012) and Inherent Vice (2014). Anderson\\'s eighth film, Phantom Thread, was released in 2017. He has directed music videos for artists including Fiona Apple, Radiohead, Haim, Joanna Newsom, Aimee Mann, Jon Brion, and Michael Penn, and has also directed a documentary, Junun (2015), about the making of the album of the same name in India.  More recently, he directed a short film accompanying Thom Yorke\\'s Anima (2019), released on Netflix and in select IMAX theatres.\\nAnderson\\'s films are often characterized by their depiction of flawed and desperate characters, memorable music, explorations of themes such as dysfunctional families, alienation, loneliness, and redemption, and a bold visual style that uses moving camera and long takes. Many of his films take place in the San Fernando Valley. He is noted for his frequent collaborations with actors Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, Joaquin Phoenix, and Daniel Day-Lewis, cinematographer Robert Elswit, costume designer Mark Bridges, and composers Jon Brion and Jonny Greenwood. His films have consistently garnered critical acclaim. Anderson has been nominated for eight Academy Awards, one Golden Globe Award, and five BAFTA Awards, and has won a Best Director Award at Cannes, both a Golden and a Silver Bear at Berlin, and a Silver Lion at Venice.\\n\\nEarly life\\nAnderson was born in Studio City, Los Angeles, to Edwina (née Gough) and Ernie Anderson. Ernie was an actor who was the voice of ABC and a Cleveland television late-night horror movie host known as \"Ghoulardi\" (after whom Anderson later named his production company). Anderson grew up in the San Fernando Valley. He is third-youngest of nine children. He had a troubled relationship with his mother, but was close with his father, who encouraged him to become a writer or director. Anderson attended a number of schools, including Buckley in Sherman Oaks, John Thomas Dye School, Campbell Hall School, Cushing Academy, and Montclair Prep.Anderson was involved in filmmaking from a young age, and never really had an alternative plan to directing films. He made his first film when he was eight, and started making films on a Betamax video camera that his father bought in 1982. He later started using 8 mm film, but realized that video was easier. He began writing in his adolescence, and began experimenting with a Bolex 16-mm camera. After years of experimenting with \"standard fare\", he wrote and filmed his first real production as a senior in high school at Montclair Prep using money he earned cleaning cages at a pet store. The film was a 30-minute mockumentary shot on video called The Dirk Diggler Story (1988), about a pornography star; the story was inspired by John Holmes, who also served as a major inspiration for Boogie Nights.\\n\\nCareer\\nEarly career\\nAnderson attended Santa Monica College before enrolling and spending two semesters as an English major at Emerson College where he was taught by David Foster Wallace, and only two days at New York University before he began his career as a production assistant on television, films, music videos, and game shows in Los Angeles and New York City. Feeling that the material shown to him at film school turned the experience into \"homework or a chore\", Anderson decided to make a 20-minute film that would be his \"college\".For $10,000, made up of gambling winnings, his girlfriend\\'s credit card, and money his father set aside for him for college, Anderson made Cigarettes & Coffee (1993), a short film connecting multiple story lines with a $20 bill. The film was screened at the 1993 Sundance Festival Shorts Program. He decided to expand the film to feature-length, and was invited to the 1994 Sundance Feature Film Program. Michael Caton-Jones served as Anderson\\'s mentor. He saw Anderson as someone with \"talent and a fully formed creative voice, but not much hands-on experience\", and gave him some hard and practical lessons.\\n\\n1990s\\nWhile at the Sundance Feature Film program, Anderson already had a deal with Rysher Entertainment to direct his first full-length feature, Sydney, retitled Hard Eight. After completing the film, Rysher re-edited it. Anderson, who still had the workprint of his original cut, submitted the film to the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, where it was shown at the Un Certain Regard section. Anderson managed to get the version released, but only after he retitled the film, and raised the $200,000 necessary to finish it. Anderson, Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly, and Gwyneth Paltrow contributed to the final funding. The version that was released was Anderson\\'s and the acclaim from the film launched his career. The film follows a senior gambler, who takes a homeless man under his wing, while he becomes romantically involved with a troubled waitress. It also featured Philip Seymour Hoffman as an arrogant gambler, beginning a five-film collaboration between the pair. In his review of the film, Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert wrote, \"Movies like Hard Eight remind me of what original, compelling characters the movies can sometimes give us.\"Anderson began working on the script for his next feature film during his troubles with Hard Eight, completing the script in 1995. The result was his breakout film Boogie Nights, which is based on his short film The Dirk Diggler Story, and is set in the Golden Age of Porn. The film follows a nightclub dishwasher (Mark Wahlberg) who becomes a popular pornographic actor under his stage name. The script was noticed by New Line Cinema\\'s president, Michael De Luca, who felt \"totally gaga\" reading it. It was released on October 10, 1997, and was a critical and commercial success. The film revived the career of Burt Reynolds, and provided breakout roles for Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. After the film\\'s production, Reynolds refused to star in Anderson\\'s third film, Magnolia. At the 70th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for three awards, including for Best Supporting Actor (Reynolds), Best Supporting Actress (Moore), and Best Original Screenplay.After the success of Boogie Nights, New Line told Anderson that he could do whatever he wanted for his next film, and granted him creative control. Though Anderson initially wanted to make a film that was \"intimate and small-scale\", the script \"kept blossoming\". The resulting film was the ensemble piece Magnolia (1999), which tells the story of the peculiar interaction of several individuals in the San Fernando Valley. Anderson used the music of Aimee Mann as a basis and inspiration for the film, commissioning her to write eight new songs. At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including for Best Supporting Actor (Tom Cruise), Best Original Song for \"Save Me\" by Aimee Mann, and Best Original Screenplay. Anderson stated after the film\\'s release, \"what I really feel is that Magnolia is, for better or worse, the best movie I\\'ll ever make.\"\\n\\n2000s\\nAfter the success of Magnolia, Anderson stated that he would like to work with Adam Sandler in the future, and that he was determined to make his next film a comparatively shorter length of 90 minutes. The resulting feature was the romantic comedy-drama film Punch-Drunk Love (2002), starring Sandler, with Emily Watson portraying his love interest. The story centers on a beleaguered small-business owner with anger issues and seven emasculating sisters. A subplot in the film was partly based on David Phillips (also called the Pudding Guy). Sandler received critical praise for his role in his first major departure from the mainstream comedies that had made him a star. At the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, Anderson won the Best Director Award and was nominated for the Palme d\\'Or.There Will Be Blood (2007) was loosely based on Upton Sinclair\\'s novel Oil!. It follows a ruthless silver miner exploiting the Southern California oil boom in the early 20th century. Against a budget of $25 million, the film earned $76.1 million worldwide. There Will Be Blood received eight Academy Award nominations, tying with No Country for Old Men for the most nominations that year. Anderson was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, losing all three to the Coen Brothers for No Country for Old Men. Daniel Day-Lewis won the Oscar for Best Actor. Paul Dano received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Anderson was nominated for Best Director from the Directors Guild of America. There Will Be Blood was regarded by some critics as one of the greatest films of the decade, with some parties further declaring it one of the most accomplished American films of the modern era. David Denby of The New Yorker wrote, \"the young writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson has now done work that bears comparison to the greatest achievements of Griffith and Ford\", while Richard Schickel proclaimed it \"one of the most wholly original American movies ever made\".  In 2017, New York Times film critics A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis named it the \"Best Film of the 21st Century So Far\".\\n\\n2010s\\nIn December 2009, Anderson was working on a new project about a \"charismatic intellectual\" who starts a new religion in the 1950s. An associate of Anderson\\'s stated that the idea for the film had been in Anderson\\'s head for about 12 years. The Master was released on September 14, 2012 in North America to critical acclaim. The film follows an alcoholic World War II veteran, who meets the leader of a religious movement known as \"The Cause\". Though the film makes no reference to the movement, it has \"long been widely assumed to be based on Scientology.\" The film received three nominations at the 85th Academy Awards, including for Joaquin Phoenix for Best Leading Actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman for Best Supporting Actor, and Amy Adams for Best Supporting Actress.Production of the film adaptation for Thomas Pynchon\\'s 2009 novel Inherent Vice began in May and ended in August of 2013. The film marked the first time that Pynchon allowed his work to be adapted for the screen, and had Anderson work with Phoenix for a second time. The supporting cast includes Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon, Jena Malone, Martin Short, Benicio Del Toro, Katherine Waterston, and Josh Brolin. Following its release in December 2014, the film received two nominations at the 87th Academy Awards, including for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Costume Design.\\n\\nAnderson directed Junun, a 2015 documentary about the making of the album by composer and Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur, and a group of Indian musicians. Most of the performances were recorded at the 15th-century Mehrangarh Fort in Rajasthan. Junun premiered at the 2015 New York Film Festival.Anderson\\'s ninth film, Phantom Thread, set in the London fashion industry in 1954, was released in late 2017. The film stars Daniel Day-Lewis in his first acting role since Lincoln in 2012, and his self-proclaimed final performance in a film, following four decades in the profession. The cast also includes Lesley Manville, Vicky Krieps and Richard Graham. Focus Features distributed the film in the United States, with Universal handling international distribution. Principal photography began in January 2017. Robert Elswit was absent during production, and despite claims of Anderson acting as a cinematographer on the film, no official credit was given. The film received six nominations at the 90th Academy Awards, winning one for Best Costume Design.\\n\\n2020s\\nHis next film was announced to be produced by Focus Features, \\nPhantom Thread\\'s production studio, on December 18, 2019. The film is reportedly to be \"taking place in the 1970s and focuses on a high-school student who is also a successful child actor\", with production having begun in August 2020. The working title is Soggy Bottom, and filming wrapped and postproduction began in November 2020.\\n\\nOther work\\nIn 2000, Anderson wrote and directed a segment for Saturday Night Live with Ben Affleck, \"SNL FANatic\", based on the MTV series FANatic. He was a standby director during the 2005 filming of Robert Altman\\'s A Prairie Home Companion for insurance purposes, as Altman was 80 years old at the time. In 2008, Anderson co-wrote and directed a 70-minute play at the Largo Theatre, comprising a series of vignettes starring Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen, with a live score by Jon Brion.Anderson has directed music videos for artists including Fiona Apple, Radiohead, Haim, Joanna Newsom, Aimee Mann, Jon Brion, and Michael Penn. Anderson directed a short film for Haim in 2017, Valentine, featuring three musical performances from the band. In 2019, Anderson directed the short film Anima, starring singer Thom Yorke and featuring music from Yorke\\'s Anima album. It was screened in select IMAX theatres on June 26 and released on Netflix on June 27.\\n\\nInfluences and style\\nInfluences\\nAnderson attended film school for only two days, preferring to learn the craft by watching films by the filmmakers he liked, as well as watching films accompanied by director\\'s audio commentary. He has cited Stanley Kubrick, Robert Altman, Jonathan Demme, Martin Scorsese, Orson Welles, Max Ophüls, Mike Leigh, and Robert Downey, Sr., as influences.In 1999, Anderson met Kubrick on the set of Eyes Wide Shut, thanks to Tom Cruise, who had been cast in Magnolia. Anderson asked Kubrick, \"Do you always work with so few people?\" Kubrick answered him, \"‘Why? How many people do you need?\" Because of this, Anderson said that he \"felt like such a Hollywood asshole.\"\\n\\nThemes and style\\nAnderson is known for films set in San Fernando Valley with realistically flawed and desperate characters. Among the themes dealt with in Anderson\\'s films are dysfunctional familial relationships, alienation, surrogate families, regret, loneliness, destiny, the power of forgiveness, and ghosts of the past. Anderson makes frequent use of repetition to build emphasis and thematic consistency. In Boogie Nights, Magnolia, Punch Drunk Love and The Master, the phrase \"I didn\\'t do anything\" is used at least once, developing themes of responsibility and denial. Anderson\\'s films are known for their bold visual style which includes stylistic trademarks such as constantly moving camera, steadicam-based long takes, memorable use of music, and multilayered audiovisual imagery. Anderson also tends to reference the Book of Exodus, either explicitly or subtly, such as in recurring references to Exodus 8:2 in Magnolia, which chronicles the plague of frogs, culminating with the literal raining of frogs in the film\\'s climax, or the title and themes in There Will Be Blood, a phrase in Exodus 7:19, which details the plague of blood.Within his first three films, Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia, Anderson explored themes of dysfunctional families, alienation, and loneliness. Boogie Nights and Magnolia were noted for their large ensemble casts, which Anderson returned to in Inherent Vice. In Punch-Drunk Love, Anderson explored similar themes, but expressed a different visual style, shedding the influences and references of his earlier films, being more surreal and having a heightened sense of reality. It was also short, compared to his previous two films, at 90 minutes.There Will Be Blood stood apart from his first four films, but shared similar themes and style such as flawed characters, moving camera, memorable music, and a lengthy running time. The film was more overtly engaged with politics than his previous films had been, examining capitalism and themes such as savagery, optimism, and obsession. The Master dealt with \"ideas about American personality, success, rootlessness, master-disciple dynamics, and father-son mutually assured destruction.\" All of his films deal with American themes, with business versus art in Boogie Nights, ambition in There Will Be Blood, and self-reinvention in The Master.\\n\\nFrequent collaborators\\nAnderson frequently collaborates with many actors and crew, carrying them over on each films. He has referred to regular actors as \"my little rep company\", including John C. Reilly, Philip Baker Hall, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Melora Walters, and most prominently, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Luis Guzmán is also considered Anderson\\'s regular. Hoffman acted in Anderson\\'s first four films as well as The Master. Except for Paul F. Tompkins, Kevin Breznahan and Jim Meskimen, who all had equally minor roles in Magnolia, There Will Be Blood had an entirely new cast. Anderson is one of three directors – the others being Jim Sheridan and Martin Scorsese – with whom Daniel Day-Lewis has collaborated more than once. Robert Elswit served as a cinematographer for Anderson\\'s films, except The Master which was shot by Mihai Mălaimare Jr. and Phantom Thread which has no credited cinematographer. Jon Brion served as a composer for Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love, and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead for every films since. Dylan Tichenor edited Boogie Nights, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood and Phantom Thread. Anderson regularly works with producing partners, JoAnne Sellar, Scott Rudin, Michael De Luca, and Daniel Lupi, and casting director Cassandra Kulukundis.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nAnderson dated Fiona Apple from 1997 to 2002. During their relationship, the two used ecstasy and cocaine; Apple described him as having a temper and leaving her \"fearful and numb,\" throwing a chair across the room and shoving her out of his car.He has been in a long-term relationship with actress and comedienne Maya Rudolph since November 2001. They live in the San Fernando Valley with their four children—daughters Pearl Minnie (born October 2005), Lucille (born November 2009), Minnie Ida (born August 2013), and son Jack (born July 2011).\\n\\nFilmography\\nAwards and recognition\\nAnderson has been called \"one of the most exciting talents to come along in years\" and \"among the supreme talents of today.\" After the release of Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Anderson was praised as a wunderkind. In 2007, the American Film Institute regarded him as \"one of American film\\'s modern masters.\" In 2012, The Guardian ranked him number one on its list of \"The 23 Best Film Directors in the World,\" writing \"his dedication to his craft has intensified, with his disdain for PR and celebrity marking him out as the most devout filmmaker of his generation.\" In 2013, Entertainment Weekly named him the eighth-greatest working director, calling him \"one of the most dynamic directors to emerge in the last 20 years.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that \"The Master, the sixth film from the 42-year-old writer-director, affirms his position as the foremost filmmaking talent of his generation. Anderson is a rock star, the artist who knows no limits.\"Other directors have also praised him. In an interview with Jan Aghed, Ingmar Bergman referenced Magnolia as an example of the strength of American cinema. Sam Mendes referred to Anderson as \"a true auteur – and there are very few of those who I would classify as geniuses\". In his acceptance speech for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, Ben Affleck compared Anderson to Orson Welles.As of 2020, Anderson is the only person to win all three director prizes from the three major international film festivals (Cannes, Berlin, Venice).\\n\\nAwards received by Anderson movies\\nDirection for Oscar-related performances\\nAnderson has directed multiple Oscar nominated performances.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nPaul Thomas Anderson at IMDb\\nCigarettes & Red Vines - The Definitive Paul Thomas Anderson Resource\\nEsquire magazine profile',\n",

It is the largest education company and was once the largest book publisher in the world. In 2013 Pearson merged its Penguin Books with German conglomerate Bertelsmann. In 2015 the company announced a change to focus solely on education. Pearson plc owns the GCSE examining board for the UK, Edexcel. Pearson has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American depositary receipts.\\n\\nHistory\\nConstruction business: 1844 to the 1920s\\nThe company was founded by Samuel Pearson in 1844 as a building and engineering concern operating in Yorkshire under the name S. Pearson & Son.  In 1880, control passed to his grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson (later 1st Viscount Cowdray), an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world\\'s largest construction companies. Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor\\'s agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897. The company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world. In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I. In 1907 Weetman Pearson founded investment company Whitehall Securities Corporation Ltd which played an important role in the development of British airlines in the 1930s.The construction business was shut down in the 1920s.

Then in May 2012 Pearson announced its acquisition of GlobalEnglish Corporation, an American Business English software and solutions company, in an all-cash transaction.In May 2013, Pearson announced a new restructuring plan to invest in digital learning and emerging markets, after predicting weaker earnings.The change supports the decoupling of the Penguin consumer publishing business into a separate entity with Random House (forming Penguin Random House). The new structure combines the separate education companies, Pearson International and Pearson North America under one Pearson company.  Pearson will organise around three global lines of business – School, Higher Education and Professional.  The Financial Times Group and Pearson English will form part of Pearson Professional.In July 2014, the company announced it had cut 4,000 jobs, representing 10% of the company\\'s workforce.Pearson announced on 23 July 2015 that it had agreed to sell the FT Group, which includes business daily Financial Times, to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844 million, or $1.32 billion. The sale does not include FT Group\\'s London property at One Southwark Bridge. In August 2015, Pearson\\'s sold its 50% stake in The Economist to the Agnelli family for £469 million who previously held 4.7% of the group. The remaining 50% of The Economist Group is owned by the Schroders, Cadburys and the Rothschilds.On 5 November 2015, the company announced it was rebranding, including the creation of a new logo, with a \"100% focus\" on education.On 3 July 2017, Pearson sold its Tutor Vista and Edurite lines of business to India-based education technology company, Byju\\'s On 11 July 2017, Pearson agreed to reduce its holding in Penguin Random House to 25%, by selling a 22% stake in the business to Bertelsmann.In August 2017 Pearson announced that it would cut 3,000 staff in an effort to save £300 million annually. On 16 August 2017 Pearson sold the language training subsidiary Global Education to Chinese company Pu-Xin Education for £62 million.In November 2018 Pearson announced the launch of the Pearson Alumni Network.In 2019, Pearson sold its US K-12 business to the private equity firm Nexus Capital Management. Pearson also sold its remaining 25% stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann. Pearson CEO John Fallon retired from the company in 2020 and was succeeded by Andy Bird on 19 October 2020.\\n\\nOperations\\nPearson has two main streams of business:\\nGlobal lines of business: focuses on the school, higher education and professional areas (includes textbooks and digital technologies for teachers and students). Pearson\\'s school brands include BTEC, Bug Club, Edexcel, Fronter, GradPoint, Schoolnet, and SuccessNet. Pearson\\'s higher education brands include eCollege, Mastering/MyLabs, Revel, online tutoring (Smarthinking), and Financial Times Publishing.\\nGeographic streams: focuses on North American market, growth markets and core markets\\n\\nPearson in Practice\\nPearson in Practice Technology, formerly Zenos IT Academy, was only part of Pearson in Practice and was an institute offering government-funded apprenticeships for learners aged 16 to 24, and paid learning for people outside those boundaries. It focuses on giving its candidates the ability to sit Microsoft exams after an intense learning program that lasts for 12 months. Learners explored the full boundaries of computing, by looking at advanced server technology, internet knowledge, group policies and various other sections related to networks and computers. According to an Ofsted report in 2012, the graduation rate for the Zenos organization was higher than the average college percentages, and lay at 90%.Pearson announced plans to exit Pearson in Practice on 7 January 2013, although learners already signed up will be supported until the end of their courses. In February 2013 it was transferred to Vision Workforce Skills.\\n\\nCriticism\\nConcerns exist around the amount of influence Pearson, being a commercial company, has on public education.  Other concerns are around tax avoidance, high value contracts, and in one instance, laying off teachers to offset the high costs of testing. In 2017, more than six out of ten Pearson\\'s shareholders voted against the chief executive\\'s pay package of £1.5m after the company made a record loss. Pearson US has been criticised for using offshore tax avoidance schemes involving a host of companies at a service address in Luxembourg.In the United Kingdom, Pearson owns Edexcel, an education and examination board. Edexcel has produced qualifications which link to Pearson texts, although Edexcel also continues to endorse textbooks published by other companies. Edexcel has also faced criticism over repeated leaks of exam material in consecutive years; police investigations into some of the incidents were referred to prosecutors.In June 2010, Pearson plc received notification that the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) founded by Muammar Gaddafi\\'s son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a sovereign fund, had acquired 24,431,000 shares within the company via Euroclear. On further investigation, Pearson said the LIA may have acquired an additional 2,141,179 shares, resulting in a total interest of 26,572,179 shares. At the time, this represented a major holding of 3.27% within the company and the investment was worth around £280 million.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website \\nPearson plc companies grouped at OpenCorporates\\nList of Pearson-owned companies from the Columbia Journalism Review\\nMary H.

              " 'Pete Mitchell (Top Gun)': 'Top Gun is a 1986 American action drama film directed by Tony Scott, and produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, in association with Paramount Pictures. The screenplay was written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in California magazine three years earlier. The film stars Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer, Anthony Edwards, and Tom Skerritt. Cruise plays Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young naval aviator aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. He and his Radar Intercept Officer, LTJG Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy\\'s Fighter Weapons School at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California.\\nTop Gun was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent. Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing US$356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an IMAX 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the film won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Take My Breath Away\" performed by Berlin.\\nIn 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A sequel, titled Top Gun: Maverick was originally scheduled for release on June 26, 2020, which was postponed to December 23, 2020, then to July 2, 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nPlot\\nUnited States Naval Aviator LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) LTJG Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw are stationed aboard the USS Enterprise, from which they fly the F-14A Tomcat. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft, Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick\\'s wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his wings, citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick\\'s recklessness, CAG \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose to attend TOPGUN, the Naval Fighter Weapons School at Naval Air Station Miramar.\\nAt a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. Maverick learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an astrophysicist and civilian TOPGUN instructor. Charlie later becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft\\'s performance.\\nDuring Maverick\\'s first training hop he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks a major rule of engagement and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Privately, Jester confides that he admires Maverick\\'s skill, but does not know if he would trust him as a teammate in combat. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, who considers Maverick\\'s attitude \"foolish\" and his flying \"dangerous\"—as Maverick\\'s tendency to abandon his team and pursue reckless objectives makes him \"unsafe\" to fly with. In class, Charlie also objects to Maverick\\'s aggressive tactics but privately admits to him that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\\nDuring another training hop (Hop 19), Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper. Viper admits he is impressed with his flying abilities but Maverick is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Jester publicly tells Maverick that his flying is excellent, but that he should \"never leave [his] wingman\".\\nMaverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the TOPGUN Trophy, chase an A-4 in a later training engagement (Hop 31). Since part of the scoring in every flight in the course is the time taken for every dogfight to conclude, and after noticing that Iceman is pulling time during his chase after the A-4 so that his total score in the course will remain higher than Maverick\\'s, Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement with the A-4 they are both chasing so that he can shoot it down himself, but Maverick\\'s F-14 flies through the jet wash of Iceman\\'s aircraft and suffers a flameout of both engines, going into an unrecoverable flat spin.  Maverick and Goose eject, but Goose hits the jettisoned aircraft canopy head-first and is killed.\\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose\\'s death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick\\'s father Duke Mitchell on the USS Oriskany and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the TOPGUN Trophy.\\nDuring the graduation party, Viper and Jester call in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to the Enterprise to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.\\nMaverick and Merlin (Cougar\\'s former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman\\'s reservations over Maverick\\'s state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a catapult failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose\\'s death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, the two are still badly outnumbered, but Maverick vocally refuses to leave Iceman without a wingman and manages to shoot down three MiGs. Iceman, shifting to offense, also shoots one down, which forces the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to Enterprise, Iceman and Maverick share newfound respect in each other, and Maverick throws Goose\\'s dog tags overboard.\\nOffered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to TOPGUN as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nBackground\\nThe primary inspiration for the film was the article \"Top Guns\" by Ehud Yonay, from the May 1983 issue of California magazine, which featured aerial photography by then-Lieutenant Commander Charles \"Heater\" Heatley. The article detailed the life of fighter pilots at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, self-nicknamed as \"Fightertown USA\". Numerous screenwriters allegedly turned down the project. Bruckheimer and Simpson went on to hire Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., to write the first draft. The research methods, by Epps, included attendance at several declassified Topgun classes at Miramar and gaining experience by being flown in an F-14. The first draft failed to impress Bruckheimer and Simpson, and is considered to be very different from the final product in numerous ways. Tony Scott was hired to direct on the strength of a commercial he had done for Swedish automaker Saab in the early 1980s, where a Saab 900 turbo is shown racing a Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet.Actor Matthew Modine turned down the role of Pete Mitchell (that went to Tom Cruise) because he felt the film\\'s pro-military stance went against his politics. The character of Chipper Piper was created just for Pasdar as Scott loved his performance.The producers wanted the assistance of the US Navy in the production of the film. The Navy was influential in relation to script approval, which resulted in changes being made. The opening dogfight was moved to international waters as opposed to Cuba, the language was toned down, and a scene that involved a crash on the deck of an aircraft carrier was also scrapped. Maverick\\'s love interest was also changed from a female enlisted member of the Navy to a civilian contractor with the Navy, due to the US military\\'s prohibition of fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel. The \"Charlie\" character also replaced an aerobics instructor from an early draft as a love interest for Maverick after producers were introduced to Christine \"Legs\" Fox, a civilian mathematician employed by the Center for Naval Analyses as a specialist in Maritime Air Superiority (MAS), developing tactics for aircraft carrier defense.Julianne Phillips was in consideration for the role of Charlie, and had been scheduled to perform a screen test opposite Tom Cruise.Rear Admiral Pete \"Viper\" Pettigrew, a former Navy aviator, Vietnam War veteran, and Topgun instructor served as a technical advisor on the film, and also made a cameo appearance in the film as a colleague of Charlie\\'s.\\nFormer Top Gun instructor pilot and Congressman Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham claimed to have been the inspiration for Pete Mitchell, although the film\\'s producers have denied that the character was based on any specific Naval Aviator.\\n\\nFilming\\nThe Navy made several aircraft from F-14 fighter squadron VF-51 \"Screaming Eagles\" (which Tom Skerritt mentions in the scene at his home) available for the film. Paramount paid as much as US$7,800 per hour (equivalent to $18,500 today) for fuel and other operating costs whenever aircraft were flown outside their normal duties. Shots of the aircraft carrier sequences were filmed aboard USS Enterprise, showing aircraft from F-14 squadrons VF-114 \"Aardvarks\" and VF-213 \"Black Lions\". The majority of the carrier flight deck shots were of normal aircraft operations and the film crew had to take what they could get, save for the occasional flyby which the film crew would request. During filming, director Tony Scott wanted to shoot aircraft landing and taking off, back-lit by the sun. During one particular filming sequence, the ship\\'s commanding officer changed the ship\\'s course, thus changing the light. When Scott asked if they could continue on their previous course and speed, he was informed by the commander that it cost US$25,000 (equivalent to $59,000 today) to turn the ship, and to continue on course. Scott wrote the carrier\\'s captain a US$25,000 check so that the ship could be turned and he could continue shooting for another five minutes.\\n\\nFuture NASA astronaut Scott Altman piloted F-14 aircraft for many of the film\\'s stunt sequences, having been recently stationed at NAS Miramar at time of filming. Altman was the pilot seen \"flipping the bird\" in the film\\'s well-known opening sequence, as well as piloting the aircraft shown \"buzzing the tower\" throughout the film. Most of the sequences of the aircraft maneuvering over land were shot at Naval Air Station Fallon, in Nevada, using ground-mounted cameras. Air-to-air shots were filmed using a Learjet, piloted by Astrovision inventor and legendary pilot Clay Lacy. His name is misspelled in the closing credits, as Clay Lacey. Grumman, manufacturer of the F-14, was commissioned by Paramount Pictures to create camera pods to be placed upon the aircraft that could be pointed toward either the front or rear of the aircraft providing outside shots at high altitude.In July 1985, Kansas City Barbeque served as a filming location for two scenes. The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"Great Balls of Fire\" while seated at the piano. The final scene, where \"You\\'ve Lost That Lovin\\' Feelin\\'\" can be heard on the restaurant\\'s jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008.Renowned aerobatic pilot Art Scholl was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a flat spin, which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his Pitts Special biplane into the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast near Carlsbad on September 16, 1985. Neither Scholl\\'s body nor his aircraft was recovered, leaving the official cause of the accident unknown. Top Gun was dedicated to Scholl\\'s memory.The film was shot in the Super 35 format, as anamorphic lenses were too large to fit inside the cockpits of the fighter jets.Reshoots after Top Gun\\'s filming wrapped conflicted with Made in Heaven, in which McGillis starred with brown hair. Top Gun\\'s filmmakers were forced to hide her hair color, which for example resulted a scene shot in an elevator that featured McGillis in a baseball cap.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe Top Gun soundtrack is one of the most popular soundtracks to date, reaching 9× Platinum certification and No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 200 albums chart for five nonconsecutive weeks in the summer and fall of 1986. Harold Faltermeyer, who previously worked with both Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson on Beverly Hills Cop, was sent the script of Top Gun by Bruckheimer before filming began. Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock worked on numerous songs including the Oscar-winning \"Take My Breath Away\". Kenny Loggins performed two songs on the soundtrack, \"Playing with the Boys\", and \"Danger Zone\". Berlin recorded the song \"Take My Breath Away\", which would later win numerous awards, sending the band to international acclaim. After the release of Loggins\\'s single \"Danger Zone\", sales of the album exploded, selling 7 million in the United States alone. On the re-release of the soundtrack in 2000, two songs that had been omitted from the original album (and had been released many years before the film was made), \"Great Balls of Fire\" by Jerry Lee Lewis and \"You\\'ve Lost That Lovin\\' Feelin\\'\" by The Righteous Brothers, were added. The soundtrack also includes \"Top Gun Anthem\" and \"Memories\" by Steve Stevens/Faltermeyer and Faltermeyer.\\nOther artists were considered for the soundtrack project but did not participate. Bryan Adams was considered as a potential candidate but refused to participate because he felt the film glorified war. The band Toto was originally meant to record \"Danger Zone\", and had also written and recorded a song \"Only You\" for the soundtrack. However, there was a dispute between Toto\\'s lawyers and the producers of the film, paving the way for Loggins to record \"Danger Zone\" and \"Only You\" being omitted from the film entirely.\\n\\nRelease\\nTheatrical\\nThe film\\'s premiere was held in New York City on May 12, 1986 with another held in San Diego on May 15.The film opened in the United States in 1,028 theaters on May 16, 1986.\\n\\nHome media\\nIn addition to its box office success, Top Gun went on to break further records in the then still-developing home video market. It was the first new-release blockbuster on video cassette to be priced as low as $26.95 and, backed by a massive $8 million marketing campaign, including a Top Gun-themed Diet Pepsi commercial, the advance demand was such that the film became the best-selling videocassette in the industry\\'s history on pre-orders alone, with over 1.9 million units ordered before its launch on March 10, 1987. It eventually sold a record 2.9 million units.The film was first released in the U.S. on DVD under Paramount Pictures on October 21, 1998 and included the film in both Widescreen (non-anamorphic Univisium 2.00:1) and Full Screen (open matte) versions. Top Gun\\'s home video success was again reflected by strong DVD sales, which were furthered by a Special Collector\\'s Edition 2-disc DVD release on December 14, 2004 in both Widescreen (anamorphic 2.39:1) and Full Screen (open matte) versions, that include new bonus features. Special features comprise audio commentary by Bruckheimer, Tony Scott and naval experts, four music videos including the \"Top Gun Anthem\" and \"Take My Breath Away\", a six-part documentary on the making of Top Gun, and vintage gallery with interviews, behind-the-scenes and survival training featurettes.Subsequently, the film was first released on Blu-ray disc on July 29, 2008 with the same supplemental features as the Collector\\'s Edition DVD and also as a 2-disc limited edition 3D copy on February 19, 2013. The remastered Blu-ray and Digital Copy version of the film was released on May 19, 2019 on Paramount Movies.\\nTop Gun was released in the U.S. on remastered Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD on May 19, 2020 with two new special features titled The Legacy of Top Gun and On Your Six: Thirty Years of Top Gun, with the remaining bonus features being ported over.\\n\\nIMAX 3D re-release\\nTop Gun was re-released in IMAX 3D on February 8, 2013, for six days. A four-minute preview of the conversion, featuring the \"Danger Zone\" flight sequence, was screened at the 2012 International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nThe film quickly became a success and was the highest-grossing film of 1986. It would be six months before its theater count dropped below that of its opening week. It was number one on its first weekend with a gross of US$8,193,052, and went on to a total domestic gross of US$176,781,728. Internationally it took in an estimated US$177,030,000 for a worldwide box office total of US$353,811,728. The film sold an estimated 47,650,100 tickets in North America in its initial theatrical run.The film grossed an additional US$3,018,873 in its IMAX re-release in 2013 bringing its domestic gross to US$179,800,601 and its worldwide gross to US$356,830,601.\\n\\nCritical response\\nUpon the film\\'s original release, critical response was mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 55% based on reviews from 55 critics, with an average rating of 5.85/10. The website\\'s critical consensus states: \"Though it features some of the most memorable and electrifying aerial footage shot with an expert eye for action, Top Gun offers too little for non-adolescent viewers to chew on when its characters aren\\'t in the air.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying that \"Movies like Top Gun are hard to review because the good parts are so good and the bad parts are so relentless. The dogfights are absolutely the best since Clint Eastwood\\'s electrifying aerial scenes in Firefox. But look out for the scenes where the people talk to one another.\"\\n\\nAwards\\nThe film was nominated for and won many awards, most prominently for its sound and effects.

Yahoo! Movies ranked Top Gun number 19 on their list of greatest action films of all-time. The film was nominated multiple times for various AFI lists, but broke through only once. In 2005, the line \"I feel the need... the need for speed!\" was ranked 94 on AFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list.\\n\\nAmerican Film Institute listAFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:\\n\"I feel the need — the need for speed.\" – #94\\n\\nEffect on military recruiting\\nMovie producer John Davis said that Top Gun was a recruiting video for the Navy, that people saw the movie and said, \"Wow! I want to be a pilot.\" The Navy had recruitment booths in some theaters to attract enthusiastic patrons. After the film\\'s release, the US Navy stated that the number of young men who joined wanting to be Naval Aviators went up by 500 percent.\\n\\nChinese government plagiarism\\nOn January 23, 2011, China\\'s state broadcaster China Central Television published a TV news story about the alleged efficiency of Chinese fighter pilots which incorporated footage from the Top Gun action sequences. Chinese internet users noticed the plagiarism, whereupon the broadcast was immediately withdrawn. Ironically, this occurred shortly after the initiation of a Chinese campaign to purge such forged reports; CCTV has declined comments on this incident.\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nBomber jacket sales increased and Ray-Ban Aviator sunglasses jumped 40%, due to their use by characters in the film.The 1991 film Hot Shots! was a comedy spoof of Top Gun.The masculine theme of the film has been the subject of humorous examination, with the homoerotic subtext examined in a monologue performed by Quentin Tarantino in the 1994 film Sleep with Me.Top Gun is one of many war and action films, especially those by Jerry Bruckheimer, parodied in the 2004 comedy Team America: World Police.Top Gun along with A Few Good Men are recognized for being an inspiration for the TV series JAG and the subsequent NCIS franchise in turn. JAG and NCIS are also owned by Paramount.The DisneyToon Studios film Planes (2013), pays homage to Top Gun with Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards appearing in the film as part of the voice cast.Two propaganda Chinese films, 2011\\'s Jian Shi Chu Ji (\"Skyfighters\") and 2017\\'s Kong Tian Lie (\"Sky Hunter\"), were based on Top Gun.\\n\\nSequel\\nA sequel has been in active development since at least 2010.  However plans were complicated by Scott\\'s death in 2012. In 2013 Bruckheimer said, \"For 30 years we\\'ve been trying to make a sequel and we\\'re not going to stop. We still want to do it with Tom and Paramount are still interested in making it. What Tom tells me is that no matter where he goes in the world, people refer to him as Maverick. It\\'s something he is excited about so as long as he keeps his enthusiasm hopefully we\\'ll get it made.\"By September 2014 it was revealed that Justin Marks was in negotiations to write the screenplay, which was confirmed that following June. Marks would go on later to say that the film was a dream project for him, calling the original an \"iconic film in my memory\" due in part to it being one of the first films he remembers seeing in a movie theater.In May 2017, during the promotional tour for The Mummy, Cruise confirmed that a sequel to Top Gun will start filming in 2018. By June of the same year, he said that the title will be Top Gun: Maverick with Faltermeyer back as composer for the sequel. Cruise further stated that, \"Aviators are back, the need for speed. We\\'re going to have big, fast machines. It\\'s going to be a competition film, like the first one...but a progression for Maverick.\" Later that month it was announced Joseph Kosinski, who directed Cruise in 2013\\'s Oblivion, was set to direct the sequel.A trailer was released   at ComicCon International on July 18, 2019.The release date has been pushed back several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The current release date is July 2, 2021.\\n\\nVideo games\\nTop Gun also spawned a number of video games for various platforms. The original game was released in 1986 under the same title as the film. It was released on Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST. Another game, also titled Top Gun, was released in 1987 for Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Nintendo VS. System arcade cabinets. In the 1987 game, the player pilots an F-14 Tomcat fighter, and has to complete four missions. A sequel, Top Gun: The Second Mission, was released for the NES three years later.\\nAnother game, Top Gun: Fire at Will, was released in 1996 for the PC and later for the Sony PlayStation platform. Top Gun: Hornet\\'s Nest was released in 1998. Top Gun: Combat Zones was released for PlayStation 2 in 2001 and was subsequently released for the GameCube and Microsoft Windows. Combat Zones features other aircraft besides the F-14. In 2006, another game simply titled Top Gun was released for the Nintendo DS. A 2010 game, also titled Top Gun, retells the film\\'s story. At E3 2011, a new game was announced, Top Gun: Hard Lock, which was released in March 2012 for Xbox 360, PC, and PlayStation 3.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nTop Gun at the American Film Institute Catalog\\nTop Gun at IMDb\\nTop Gun at the TCM Movie Database\\n\\'Top Gun\\' 30th Anniversary Exclusive Art Work on Fandango\\nTop Gun at AllMovie\\nTop Gun at Rotten Tomatoes\\nTop Gun at Box Office Mojo\\nParamount Movies',\n",

Editor & Publisher would instead be sold to the Duncan McIntosh Company, and Kirkus Reviews would be sold to Herbert Simon. The company\\'s first CEO was Richard Beckman, previously an executive and publisher at Condé Nast and Fairchild Publications, and former publisher of magazines GQ and Vogue. Beckman\\'s career suffered a setback in 1999 following \"some inappropriate behavior\" resulting in injuries to Vogue\\'s West Coast advertising director Carol Matthews, while Beckman was Matthews\\' publisher at Condé Nast.Beckman\\'s first major move was a re-launch of The Hollywood Reporter; with the hiring of Janice Min, formerly of Us Weekly, as editorial director, THR replaced its daily print publication with a weekly magazine, and performed a significant redesign to its website with an increased focus on breaking scoops. The new format was meant to compete against up-and-coming blogs focusing on industry news, such as Deadline Hollywood and TheWrap, along with its then-struggling rival Variety. The changes had a significant impact on the publication\\'s performance: by 2013, ad sales were up more than 50%, while traffic to the magazine\\'s website had grown by 800%. In October 2010, the company was renamed Prometheus Global Media; named after the Greek mythological figure, Beckman stated in an internal memo that the new name would \"[carry] more weight and gravitas in the marketplace.\"\\n\\nRe-organization and acquisition\\nIn late 2011, Prometheus went through a number of cost-cutting measures. In August 2011, Backstage was sold to a group of investors led by John Amato in a transaction funded by Guggenheim, and the following month, Prometheus laid off the staff responsible for the Hollywood Creative Directory and announced it had sold the publication.In January 2013, Guggenheim Partners acquired the stake in Prometheus owned by Pluribus Capital, giving it full ownership; following the acquisition, former Yahoo! executive Ross Levinsohn was named as CEO of the new Guggenheim Digital Media division, which would oversee Prometheus and other digital assets for Guggenheim companies (such as Dick Clark Productions). In April 2013, Guggenheim re-acquired Backstage (which had also acquired Sonicbids, a platform for allowing musicians to book gigs online) and made its CEO John Amato president of the Billboard Group—a new group consisting of Billboard, Backstage, and Sonicbids.In a January 2014 restructuring, Levinsohn was shifted to a business development role and no longer directly manages the Prometheus properties. Additionally, the company was split into two operating groups; an Entertainment Group was formed by merging The Hollywood Reporter into the Billboard Group, with Janice Min becoming co-president and chief creative officer of the group alongside Amato. The remaining properties, consisting of Adweek and Film Expo Group, are led by Jeff Wilbur.On May 29, 2014, Prometheus announced it would acquire the publishing assets of Mediabistro—a network of websites focusing on various aspects of the mass media industry—which includes the media job listing site Mediabistro and its network of blogs such as AgencySpy, FishbowlNY, Lost Remote and TVNewser—for $8 million. The acquisition did not include Mediabistro\\'s expo business, which were retained under the name Mecklermedia. On January 13, 2015, Adweek and Film Expo Group were merged into Mediabistro to form a new Prometheus subsidiary, Mediabistro Holdings. At the same time, its blogs were re-launched under the new \"Adweek Blog Network\" banner, and all of Mediabistro\\'s social media-oriented blogs were merged into SocialTimes.In March 2015, Guggenheim Partners reported that its president Todd Boehly was exploring the possibility of forming his own company. A representative stated that such a company would \"likely be harmonious with Guggenheim, especially since Todd\\'s role for some time has been strategic and transaction-oriented, rather than working in or managing any of our day-to-day businesses.\" On December 17, 2015, in response to losses across Guggenheim Partners, the company announced that it would spin out its media properties to a group led by Boehly, including the Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group, Mediabistro, and Dick Clark Productions, all under their existing leadership. The resultant company is known as Eldridge Industries.\\n\\nSee also\\nPenske Media Corporation\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website',\n",
              " 'Radio Times': 'Radio Times is a British weekly magazine which provides radio and television listings, and other features such as interviews, film reviews and lifestyle items. Founded in 1923 by John Reith, then general manager of the British Broadcasting Company (from 1 January 1927, the British Broadcasting Corporation), it was the world\\'s first broadcast listings magazine.It was published entirely in-house by BBC Magazines from 8 January 1937 until 2011, when the division was merged into Immediate Media Company. On 12 January 2017, Immediate Media was bought by the German media group Hubert Burda.The magazine is published on Tuesdays and carries listings for the week from Saturday to Friday. Originally, listings ran from Sunday to Saturday: the changeover meant 8 October 1960 was listed twice, in successive issues. Since Christmas 1969, a 14-day double-sized issue has been published each December containing schedules for two weeks of programmes. Originally this covered Christmas and New Year (also included bank holidays). On some occasions those each appeared in separate editions, with the two-week period ending just before the new year.\\n\\nPublication history\\nThe Radio Times was first issued on 28 September 1923 for the price of 2d, carrying details of programmes for six BBC wireless stations (2LO, 5IT, 2ZY, 5NO, 5WA and 5SC), newspapers at the time boycotted radio listings fearing that increased listenership might decrease their sales. It included a \\'message to \"listeners\"\\' by the BBC\\'s chairman, Lord Pease. Initially, The Radio Times was a combined enterprise between the British Broadcasting Company and publishers George Newnes Ltd. within the latter typeset, printed and distributed the magazine. In 1925, the BBC assumed full editorial control, but printing and distribution could not begin in-house until 1937, The Radio Times established a reputation for using leading writers and illustrators, and the covers from the special editions are now collectable design classics. By 26 September 1926, the narrow columns of BBC\\'s wireless programme schedules were broken up by the insertion of a photograph or two – relevant to or depicting subjects of the broadcasts. On 1 May 1927, The Radio Times produced an experimental Braille edition under the auspices of the National Institute for the Blind. Its success led to a regular weekly Braille version publication costing one penny.\\nFrom 5 January 1934, to facilitate these changes, the three-column programme pages were expanded to include a fourth column with the television programmes given a new section layout (from 8 January of that year), and The Radio Times announced a regular series of \"experimental television transmissions by the Baird process\" for half an hour every night at 11.00pm. The launch of the first regular 405-line television service by the BBC was reflected with television listings in The Radio Times\\' London edition of 23 October 1936. Thus Radio Times became the first ever television listings magazine in the world. Initially only two pages in each edition were devoted to television, which ran from Monday to Saturday and remained off air on Sundays.\\n\\nAfter 14 years, from issue 693 (cover date 8 January 1937), the definitive article word \"The\" was no longer used on the masthead/ The magazine became simply called Radio Times, and also published a lavish photogravure supplement on the same date of that year. Prior to the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, the BBC radio listings provided a National Programme for the whole in the United Kingdom, and the Regional Programme appeared in seven different versions (London, Midlands, North, West, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland), plus the Aberdeen and Stagshaw programmes each with a combination of national and regional were transmitted to the north east of Scotland and England respectively before the two stations merged into a single service, and included three pages of television listings.\\nWhen Britain declared war with Germany on 3 September 1939 and the television broadcasting ceased, but radio listings continued throughout the war with a reduced service. As from 23 June 1944 (just 18 days after D-Day), the Allied Expeditionary Forces edition carried details of all the programmes for the Home Service and General Forces Programme. By the same year paper rationing meant editions were only 20 pages of tiny print on thin paper. Radio Times expanded with regional editions introduced from 29 July 1945 and television resumed once again on 7 June 1946.\\nFrom 18 January 1953, television listing schedules, which had been in the back of the magazine, were placed alongside daily radio schedules. On 17 February 1957 (after the abolition of \"Toddlers\\' Truce\", in which transmissions terminated between 6 and 7pm), television listings were moved to a separate section at the front with radio listings relegated to the back, a day\\'s listings were sometimes spread over up to three double-page spreads mixed with advertisements, but this format was phased out when independent publishers were allowed to publish television schedules:\\n\\nFrom 8 October 1960, BBC television and radio schedules were re-integrated as the programmes included a new \\'pick of the week\\' with a single third page for previews before each day\\'s listings coming before the two pages of television and then four pages of radio, while the new bold masthead was designed by Abram Games (who created graphical designs such as the \\'Festival Star\\' on the cover of the 1951 Festival of Britain and the 1953 \\'Bat\\'s Wings\\' ident) containing the words \\'BBC tv and Sound\\' on the left side, which became one of the shortest-used designs in the magazine\\'s history. On 4 August 1962, when Radio Times was again revamped, the masthead was replaced with one incorporating the words in the Clarendon typeface on the left, and the \\'BBC / tv / Sound\\' (later became \\'BBC1 / tv / BBC2\\' from April 1964) reversed out to the right; while the main change was the reduction of BBC radio schedules for three stations to a double-page spread brought down into size, it had been running at between 60 and 68 pages but the relaunched issue two years earlier contained only 52 pages.\\nFrom 30 September 1967, Radio Times introduces the all-new colour pages of magazine feature sections which include \\'star stories\\', Percy Thrower\\'s gardening, Zena Skinner\\'s cookery, Bill Hartley\\'s motoring, as well as \\'round and about\\' with up-to-the-minute stories in both television and radio from around the world, and also the four new BBC radio stations (that replaces the Home Service, the Light Programme and the Third Programme) were launched within the schedule listing pages:\\n\\nOn 6 September 1969, Radio Times was given a radical makeover. The front cover was surrounded by a black border and italicised its masthead (in the Caslon typeface with swash capitals that remained until April 2001) in an attempt to emphasise the \\'R\\' for radio and \\'T\\' for television. The new format saw the introduction of a weekly column previewing \\'this week\\'s films\\' by the critic Philip Jenkinson. The look of the magazine initially became far more restrained, with less white space between columns on headings. Most significantly, the lifestyle section (which covers motoring, gardening and cookery) and the crossword was completely dropped, while the highlights section on the right page was scrapped. But despite the new look, they switched the date format from \\'month-day-year\\' to \\'day-month-year\\' and ceases carrying cigarette advertisements after 46 years since its first published. From 5 July 1975, the magazine was given a refreshed layout which consisted of horizontal black bars from top to bottom with the familiar darker-shaded look, and eventually the BBC\\'s television schedules included a \\'colour\\' annotation which was dropped after eight years, but programmes in black and white were never indicated (except feature films originally made for the cinema).\\nThe major change was on 23 November 1978 within the presentation of radio programme listings, in response to wavelength changes that enabled Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to receive their own separate domestic services in addition to Radio 4 (also known as the national \\'Radio 4 UK\\' service remained until 29 September 1984), with the arrival of these services on the pages were forced into a six-column grid. On 30 August 1980, Radio Times developed a new double-page spread of Robert Ottaway\\'s highlights from the week ahead, often used for both BBC radio and television programmes. Also, the regular inside-back-page section for younger listeners and viewers featured the Newsround presenter John Craven and a selection of new puzzles were created by the television producer Clive Doig – such as the first-ever Trackword, consisting of nine squares in one word, as well as backstage stories, and a strip cartoon of Peter Lord\\'s Morph) at the bottom of the page.\\nBetween March and December 1983, Radio Times had severe industrial disputes when the British Printing & Communications Corporation and the union SOGAT 82 joined forces, and production was affected due to printing problems:\\n\\n23 March – The BBC regrets that because at the printers for next week\\'s edition are in short supply, but copies will be available in the South West, the West of England, North East, and many parts of South and the North of England.\\n7 April – The BBC expects copies of the magazine will be available in Scotland, Northern Ireland and North of England from 16 April, following the print workers in East Kilbride and near Bristol have returned to work.\\n4 June – The general election special issue with the combined England edition, as well as the three constituent nations (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) across throughout the country was used for one week only.\\n16 July – The edition was finally returned to our fully-regionalised form with complete details of all BBC television channels and radio stations for national, regional and local.\\n10 December – The magazine was printed and published as the single national edition once again, after misses an issue but due to a print workers\\' strike from the previous week.On 23 June 1984, the radio listings have been redesigned for these pages that improve their legibility to paving the way for a new printing technology, but some copies are already printed by this process will be other changes that enhance our service to our readers, and from 1 September of that year, web-offset printing was used for the first time when the magazine became brighter and more colourful, with newsprint and sheets of gravure is replaced by black ink and white paper, also installing a Helvetica typeface that replaces Franklin Gothic which has a larger character style, and the television listings has also been redesigned including the new film icon[5] and \\'today at a glance\\' (is occupied on the far right page) were added. Starting from 25 October 1986, Radio Times introduces the new family viewing policy warns BBC Television does not broadcast programmes before 9:00pm which it believes to be unsuitable for children after that time parents can be expected to share responsibility but some programmes may be appropriate for adult audiences.\\nOn 19 November 1988, Radio Times launches our new weekly back page section called \\'My Kind of Day\\', which devoted to latest star interviews with various special guests. Also on the same year (17 December), its popularity climaxed when the Christmas edition sold an astounding 11,220,666 copies, and the Guinness Book of Records as the biggest-selling edition of any British magazine in history. \\nOn 25 March 1989 (during Easter), a general overhaul of page layout and design had taken place with a major makeover for the programme schedules and the channel headings reversed out in greater clarity, BBC1 and BBC2 were once again separated as well as the return of a old layout during the late 1950s and early 1960s, with television at the front and radio at the back, along the week\\'s Radio 1 schedules is occupied a single page followed by Radio 2 had a facing pair, then several pages of Radio 3 had five within Radio 4 had six, and finally the local radio listings, but regional features had absent from the English editions since the late 1960s were resumed in a localised page. Later on 25 November of that year, the radio schedules were restored to two pages for each day, some of the English editions for daily editorial features on radio as well.\\nFrom 2 June 1990, the entire magazine was published in colour for the first time which ended monochrome for over 67 years, the day\\'s listings beginning with a single page of highlights that includes \\'at a glance\\', followed by the double-page spreads of BBC television channels and radio stations, also the day showing inside the coloured block halfway down the pages vertically in which adds to a different colour, while the layout only lasted for six months when the new refreshed format debuted in the Christmas edition (22 December) where the programme listing pages retained their largely the same, and also the colour-coded days of the week is now at the top of the page headings.[6] On 16 February 1991 as the same date for the new BBC1 and BBC2 idents, the introduction of television logos started to cover all channels and also include the programme pages for ITV and Channel 4 illustrations where the billings of white space until the next 13 days, when the full complete listings on the four main channels and satellite television from 1 March. Also added to the local radio page was  an alphabetical list of the commercial radio stations available in the with frequency and a two-three word summary of that station\\'s output.\\nBefore the deregulation of television listings in 1991, the four weekly listings magazines were as follows:\\n\\nRadio Times carried the programme schedule listings for BBC radio and television channels, also include the new Radio 5 launched on 27 August 1990.[7]\\nThe ITV-published magazine TV Times,[8] launched on 22 September 1955 carried television programme listings for ITV, and Channel 4 from 2 November 1982. Prior to this, several of the regional ITV companies produced their own listings magazines for Look Westward (WTV), The Viewer (Tyne Tees/STV), TV Post (Ulster), Television Weekly (TWW/WWN/ITSWW/Harlech) and TV World (ATV/ABC)[9] are published, before TV Times went national on 21 September 1968.\\nRupert Murdoch\\'s newly publication TV Guide,[10] launched on 19 March 1989 carrying the 28 pages of Astra satellite (1A) television listings for Sky Television channels (including Sky One, Sky News, Sky Movies, Eurosport, and from 15 December 1990, Sky Arts, Movie Channel, Power Station[11] and Sports Channel[12] on the Marcopolo satellite which were added after the BSB\\'s merger), MTV Europe, RTL Véronique (for English programmes), Screensport, Children\\'s Channel, Lifestyle and a highlights of BBC, ITV and Channel 4 listings as well.\\nIn the Republic of Ireland, Raidió Teilifís Éireann publishes the RTÉ Guide (formerly as the RTV Guide) launched on 1 December 1961 which offers detailed programme listings for RTÉ Television and RTÉ Radio channels, while early on listings were carried for BBC Northern Ireland but were later dropped in 1966 and only RTÉ programme listings were carried until 13 April 1991.Today both publications carry listings for all major terrestrial, cable and satellite television channels in the United Kingdom and following deregulation, new listings magazines such as Mirror Group\\'s TV First, IPC Media\\'s What\\'s on TV, Bauer Media Group\\'s TV Quick and Hamfield Publications\\' TV Plus began to be published, but several newspapers would be allowed to print television schedules for the entire forthcoming week on a Saturday (or a Sunday), where previously they had only been able to list each day\\'s programmes in that edition.\\nWhile the major refresh on 31 August 1991, the four extra pages of satellite television listings and one page of highlights section were scrapped and replaced by the number of ten satellite channels (from top to bottom) is to be occupied by the daytime schedules for BBC1 and BBC2 on the left, followed by ITV and Channel 4 with \\'at a glance\\' on the right, and then the main evening schedules for terrestrial television channels that remained the same layout.

For that time during the London 2012 Olympics (also in Rio 2016) and the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, whether the listings for three terrestrial channels (BBC2, ITV and Channel 4) are now occupied on the right page and Channel 5 was moved to the next page on the left, which means BBC1 and BBC3/BBC4 as the Olympic broadcasters that also remind viewers in the possibility of both using the red button and online for BBC channels with additional broadcasts.\\nFollowing the closure of the BBC3 channel on 20 February 2016, Radio Times stated to include BBC4 in the main channels section with Channel 5 being relegated to the Freeview section, reverting back to its original four-channel format which had been used for that pages between 1 March 1991 and 29 March 1997. As from 25 March 2020, Radio Times introduces the two new sections of podcasts and the six pages of streaming and various catch-up services such as BBC iPlayer, Now TV, Disney+, BritBox, Netflix, Amazon Prime and UKTV Play. That same year (8 September), the three pages of Freeview schedules were redesigned as well as the films section (together with Film4, Talking Pictures TV, Horror Channel and three Sony Movies services), which means the children\\'s television listings along with PBS America, Smithsonian Channel, Quest, HGTV, Pick and Challenge will move to the left side in the third page next to satellite and cable section, while Sky Arts will be available free-to-air from 17 September and moves to the second page on the right side.\\n\\nCirculation and advertising\\nIn 1934, Radio Times achieved a circulation of two million and its net profit in that year was more than one quarter of the total BBC licence income. By the 1950s, Radio Times had grown to be the magazine with the largest circulation in Europe, with an average sale of 8.8 million in 1955. Following the 1969 relaunch, circulation indeed dropped by about a quarter of a million, it would take several years to recover but the magazine remained ahead of glossier, lifestyle-led competitor, TV Times. In the mid-1970s, it was just over four million; but in 2013 it was just over one million.\\nBetween April and November 1990, Radio Times launches the four-page preview of British Satellite Broadcasting programmes for five channels (that includes Sports Channel, Movie Channel, Now, Galaxy and Power Station) as seen used for advertisement feature.\\nAfter the deregulation of television listings, there was strong criticism from other listings magazines that Radio Times was advertised on the BBC (as well as on commercial broadcasting channels), saying that it gave unfair advantage to a publication and includes the tagline: \"If it\\'s on, it\\'s in\". The case went to court, but the outcome was that as the Radio Times had close connections with the BBC it would be allowed to be advertised by the BBC; however from 1992 until 2004, it must be a static picture of the cover and show clear disclaimer \"Other television listings magazines are available\" leading to the phrase entering common public usage for a time.On 9 September 2000, Rover Group sponsored Team GB for the Sydney Olympics, the two special edition cars (25 and 45) painted gold and silver were produced, in order to promote Rover\\'s association with the team and we brokered one of the first cross-platform deals and used the Radio Times portfolio for six weeks between 15 September and 1 October, with the package of activity included a \\'win a car\\' competition on a detachable front cover flap, a marketing double-page spread to promote advertorial strips on television listing pages and a web reprise that included competition fulfilment.\\nBy the early 2000s, advertisements for the publication had become sparse on the BBC. The Radio Times has not been promoted on BBC television and radio channels since 2005, following complaints by rival publications that the promotions were unfair competition.During a major revamp in April 2010, Radio Times was the third-biggest-selling magazine in the United Kingdom. However, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the magazine experienced about 2.2% year-on-year decrease to an average weekly sale of 1,648,000 in the second half of 2009. The January 2018–January 2019 circulation figure for Radio Times is 622,000 ( 11.3%), making it third in the television listings magazine market, behind TV Choice (998,561)  2.1%) and What\\'s on TV (887,049)  11.7%).[18]\\n\\nMost Powerful People\\nThe lists charted who the magazine believed were the most powerful people from three different areas of British media: comedy, drama and radio. The listing for comedy was published three times every January between 2003 and 2005; also the drama and radio lists were produced just only once each, in July 2004 and June 2005 respectively.\\nThe first \\'Most Powerful People\\' listing was published by Radio Times on 6 January 2003, and recognised the most influential people in television comedy in the United Kingdom. It was topped by the British comedian Ricky Gervais, as a result of the success of the award-winning second series of his television show The Office. The second poll, published a year later on 13 January 2004, was won by the Irish comedian and television presenter Graham Norton following his signing of two new contracts during 2003, each worth a reported £5 million. Six months later on 5 July of the same year, Radio Times published their \\'Most Powerful People in TV Drama\\' list.

After the war, regional editions were introduced on 29 July 1945 and the television service is finally resumed on 7 June 1946 – after closed down on 1 September 1939 in the duration of war for over six years.\\nThe spread of television editions for Radio Times when the full listings (with six pages) were not included in all issues until 1952:\\n\\nWhen BBC2 began in 1964, there were a number of areas where only certain parts of a region could get receive this service until 1966:\\n\\nSince November 1967, these regions were further subdivided with individual editions for each BBC Local Radio station in your English county (except the Isle of Man), as well as the national regions and several opt-out services were also used. This continued between February 1981 and January 1983 until each regional edition began to cover three local stations which was previously used by regional news and opt-out programming on Radio 4, apart from the South West (including the Channel Islands) as this is now the only part of England still without any BBC local station.

It was later dropped on 25 March 1989 when the \\'London\\' name is no longer used, became known as \\'South East\\', and later reverted back to its original name on 23 February 1991.\\nOn 29 August 1970, the four English regional editions (along the constituent nations) were separated into ten areas, such as the administrative counties of Cumberland and Westmorland (which included the Furness exclave in Lancashire and the district of Sedburgh in the West Riding of Yorkshire) before the creation of a new non-metropolitan county of Cumbria from 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 in England and Wales.\\nBetween 1 November 1982 and 22 February 1991, S4C listings were included in the Wales edition, known as \\'Rhaglenni Cymraeg\\' (Welsh programmes), while English programmes on S4C were simply billed as \\'Rhaglenni Saesneg\\' with no further detail being given. TV Times included a pull-out supplement Sbec which gave full details on all S4C programming in both languages. From the following week, it also took the billing space by cutting down on the detail in the Channel 4\\'s listings in that edition, and allowing S4C to share some of its space.\\nAfter the deregulation of television listings on 1 March 1991, they rebranded the Northern Ireland edition as \\'Ulster\\' (named after the historic Irish province), and started including listings for the Irish state broadcaster\\'s two channels – RTÉ1 and Network 2 – were occupied the lower half of the three columns devoted to UTV\\'s schedules.\\nRadio Times used to have three separate editions for STV, Grampian and Border (also appearing in the North East edition) while just then after a while they merged back into one Scotland edition from 27 July 1991.\\nThere is no edition of Radio Times in the Channel Islands as their listing schedules were contained within the South West region, but Channel TV published its own listings magazine, the CTV Times (formerly Channel Viewer) until 25 October 1991.\\nThe Yorkshire region was absorbed by the North East region on 25 September 1993 became known as \\'Yorkshire/Tyne Tees\\', and also later added the North West region on 7 April 2007.\\nFrom 2 September 1996, Tyne Tees is rebranded as \\'Channel 3 North East\\' when the relaunch become unsuccessful, and the original name was finally returned on 9 March 1998.\\nThe exception to this process of merging is Wales on 31 August 1991, which used to be part of a larger \\'Wales/West\\' (of England), mirroring the HTV area. The region was separated on 16 April 2005 leaving the West of England to join South and South West edition, and also the two regional editions of London and East Anglia will begin to merge on the same date as well.\\nOn 5 November 2001, BBC 2W launches as the digital-only service in Wales used for weekday evenings from 8.30pm to 10.00pm, within BBC2\\'s listings in the normal column is mainly split vertically in two to covering the both analogue and digital services.

              " 'Rain Man': 'Rain Man is a 1988 American road drama film directed by Barry Levinson and written by Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass. It tells the story of abrasive, selfish young wheeler-dealer Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise), who discovers that his estranged father has died and bequeathed virtually all of his multimillion dollar estate to his other son, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), an autistic savant, of whose existence Charlie was unaware. Charlie is left with only his father\\'s beloved vintage car and rosebushes. Valeria Golino also stars as Charlie\\'s girlfriend Susanna.\\nMorrow created the character of Raymond after meeting Kim Peek, a real-life savant; his characterization was based on both Peek and Bill Sackter, a good friend of Morrow who was the subject of Bill (1981), an earlier film that Morrow wrote.Rain Man was the highest-grossing film of 1988. The film was nominated for eight Oscars at the 61st Academy Awards, winning Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Actor in a Leading Role for Hoffman. The film also won the Golden Bear at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival.\\n\\nPlot\\nCharlie Babbitt is in the middle of importing four grey market Lamborghinis to Los Angeles for resale. He needs to deliver the vehicles to impatient buyers who have already made down payments in order to repay the loan he took out to buy the cars, but the EPA is holding the cars at the port on account of the cars failing emission regulations. Charlie directs an employee to lie to the buyers while he stalls his creditor.\\nWhen Charlie learns that his estranged father has died, he and his girlfriend Susanna travel to Cincinnati, Ohio in order to settle the estate. He learns he is receiving the classic 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible which he and his father fought over, but the bulk of the $3 million estate is going to an unnamed trustee. Through social engineering, he learns the money is being directed to a mental institution, where he meets his elder brother, Raymond Babbitt, of whom he was previously unaware.\\nRaymond is autistic, has savant syndrome, and adheres to strict routines. He has superb recall, but he shows little emotional expression except when in distress. Charlie spirits Raymond out of the mental institution and into a hotel for the night. Susanna becomes upset with the way Charlie treats his brother and leaves. Charlie asks Raymond\\'s doctor, Dr. Gerald R. Bruner, for half the estate in exchange for Raymond\\'s return, but he refuses. Charlie decides to attempt to gain custody of his brother in order to get control of the money.\\nAfter Raymond refuses to fly back to Los Angeles, they set out on a cross-country road trip together. They make slow progress because Raymond insists on sticking to his routines, which include watching The People\\'s Court on television every day and getting to bed by 11:00 PM. He also objects to traveling on the interstate after they pass a bad accident. During the course of the journey, Charlie learns more about Raymond, including that he is a mental calculator with the ability to instantly count hundreds of objects at once, far beyond the normal range of human subitizing abilities. He also learns that Raymond actually lived with the family when Charlie was young and he realizes that the comforting figure from his childhood, whom he falsely remembered as an imaginary friend named \"Rain Man\", was actually Raymond. He then figures that Raymond was sent away to the institution after an incident where Raymond was believed to have accidentally nearly injured a young Charlie in a scalding hot bath. Charlie realizes that to the contrary it had been Raymond\\'s actions which had saved himself from being scalded in that bathtub, but that Raymond had been unable to speak up for himself and undo the wrong caused by the misunderstanding.\\nAfter the Lamborghinis are seized by his creditor, Charlie finds himself $80,000 in debt and hatches a plan to return to Las Vegas, which they passed the night before, and win money at blackjack by counting cards. Though the casino bosses are skeptical that anyone can count cards with a six-deck shoe, after reviewing security footage they ask Charlie and Raymond to leave. Charlie has made over $86,000 to cover his debts and has reconciled with Susanna who rejoined them in Las Vegas.\\nBack in Los Angeles, Charlie meets with Dr. Bruner, who offers him $250,000 to walk away from Raymond. Charlie refuses and says that he is no longer upset about what his father left him, but he wants to have a relationship with his brother. At a meeting with a court-appointed psychiatrist, Raymond is shown to be unable to decide for himself what he wants. Charlie stops the questioning and tells Raymond he is happy to have him as his brother.\\nCharlie takes Raymond to the train station where he boards an Amtrak train with Dr. Bruner to return to the mental institution. Charlie promises Raymond that he will visit in two weeks.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nRoger Birnbaum was the first studio executive to give the film a green light; he did so immediately after Barry Morrow pitched the story. Birnbaum received \"special thanks\" in the film\\'s credits.Agents at CAA sent the script to Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray, envisioning Murray in the title role and Hoffman in the role eventually portrayed by Cruise. Martin Brest, Steven Spielberg and Sydney Pollack were directors also involved in the film. Mickey Rourke was also offered a role but he turned it down.Principal photography included nine weeks of filming on location. Other portions were shot in the desert near Palm Springs, California.Almost all of the principal photography occurred during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike; one key scene that was affected by the lack of writers was the film\\'s final scene. Bass delivered his last rough cut of the script only hours before the strike started and spent no time on the set.\\n\\nRelease\\nCritical reception\\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website\\'s critical consensus states: \"This road-trip movie about an autistic savant and his callow brother is far from seamless, but Barry Levinson\\'s direction is impressive, and strong performances from Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman add to its appeal.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 18 critic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.Vincent Canby of The New York Times called Rain Man a \"becomingly modest, decently thought-out, sometimes funny film\"; Hoffman\\'s performance was a \"display of sustained virtuosity . . . [which] makes no lasting connections with the emotions. Its end effect depends largely on one\\'s susceptibility to the sight of an actor acting nonstop and extremely well, but to no particularly urgent dramatic purpose.\" Canby considered the \"film\\'s true central character\" to be \"the confused, economically and emotionally desperate Charlie, beautifully played by Mr. Cruise.\"Amy Dawes of Variety wrote that \"one of the year\\'s most intriguing film premises ... is given uneven, slightly off-target treatment\"; she called the road scenes \"hastily, loosely written, with much extraneous screen time,\" but admired the last third of the film, calling it a depiction of \"two very isolated beings\" who \"discover a common history and deep attachment.\"One of the film\\'s harshest reviews came from New Yorker magazine critic Pauline Kael, who said, \"Everything in this movie is fudged ever so humanistically, in a perfunctory, low-pressure way. And the picture has its effectiveness: people are crying at it. Of course they\\'re crying at it—it\\'s a piece of wet kitsch.Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four. He wrote, \"Hoffman proves again that he almost seems to thrive on impossible acting challenges...I felt a certain love for Raymond, the Hoffman character. I don\\'t know quite how Hoffman got me to do it.\" Gene Siskel also gave the film three and a half stars out of four, singling out Cruise for praise, \"The strength of the film is really that of Cruise\\'s performance...the combination of two superior performances makes the movie worth watching.\"Rain Man was placed on 39 critics\\' \"ten best\" lists in 1988, based on a poll of the nation\\'s top 100 critics.\\n\\nBox office\\nRain Man debuted on December 16, 1988, and was the second highest-grossing film at the weekend box office (behind Twins), with $7 million. It reached the first spot on the December 30 – January 2 weekend, finishing 1988 with $42 million. The film would end up as the highest-grossing U.S. film of 1988 by earning over $172 million. The film grossed over $354 million worldwide.\\n\\nAwards\\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\\n\\n2006: AFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Cheers - #63\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nRain Man\\'s portrayal of the main character\\'s condition has been seen as creating the erroneous media stereotype that people on the autism spectrum typically have savant skills, and references to Rain Man, in particular Dustin Hoffman\\'s performance, have become a popular shorthand for autism and savantism. Conversely, Rain Man has also been seen as dispelling a number of other misconceptions about autism, and improving public awareness of the failure of many agencies to accommodate autistic people and make use of the abilities they do have, regardless of whether they have savant skills or not.The film is also known for popularizing the misconception that card counting is illegal in the United States.The Babbitt brothers appear in The Simpsons season 5 episode 10. The film is mentioned in films and television series such as: Miss Congeniality (2000), 21 (2008), The Hangover (2009), Tropic Thunder (2008) and Breaking Bad.\\nRaymond Babbitt was caricatured as a rain cloud in the animated episode of The Nanny, \"Oy to the World\". During the episode, Fran fixes up CC the Abominable Babcock with the Rain Man. He is portrayed as a cloud of rain mumbling about weather patterns and being an excellent driver.\\n\\nQantas and airline controversy\\nDuring June 1989, at least fifteen major airlines showed edited versions of Rain Man that omitted a scene involving Raymond\\'s refusal to fly, mentioning the crashes of American Airlines Flight 625, Delta Air Lines Flight 191, and Continental Airlines Flight 1713, except on Australia-based Qantas. Those criticizing this decision included film director Barry Levinson, co-screenwriter Ronald Bass, and George Kirgo (at the time the President of the Writers Guild of America, West). \"I think it\\'s a key scene to the entire movie,\" Levinson said in a telephone interview. \"That\\'s why it\\'s in there. It launches their entire odyssey across country – because they couldn\\'t fly.\" While some of those airlines cited as justification avoiding having airplane passengers feel uncomfortable in sympathy with Raymond during the in-flight entertainment, the scene was shown intact on flights of Qantas, and commentators noted that Raymond mentions it as the only airline whose planes have \"never crashed\". The film is credited with introducing Qantas\\' safety record to U.S. consumers.\\n\\nSee also\\nSavant syndrome\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nRain Man at the American Film Institute Catalog\\nRain Man at IMDb\\nRain Man at AllMovie\\nRain Man at the TCM Movie Database\\nRain Man at Box Office Mojo\\nRain Man at Rotten Tomatoes\\nRain Man at Metacritic',\n",

On the first night, he raids the liquor cabinet, plays the stereo loudly, and dances around the living room in his briefs and button-down shirt to \"Old Time Rock and Roll\". The following day, Miles calls a prostitute named Jackie on Joel\\'s behalf. When Jackie turns out to be a transvestite, Joel pays her just to leave, but before she does, she gives Joel the number for another prostitute named Lana. That night, Joel is unable to sleep and hesitantly calls Lana, who turns out to be a gorgeous blonde woman, and they stay sexually engaged all night.\\nLana asks Joel for $300 for her services. He goes to the bank, but when he returns, Lana is gone, along with his mother\\'s expensive Steuben glass egg. Joel finds Lana and demands the egg back, but they are interrupted by Lana\\'s pimp Guido, who pulls a gun. While in his father\\'s Porsche 928, Joel is chased by Guido, but eventually escapes. Lana tells Joel that the egg is with the rest of her stuff at Guido\\'s. Joel lets Lana stay at his house while he goes to school. When he returns, his friends have come over, and Lana has invited another prostitute, Vicki, to stay, but Joel rejects the idea. The women leave, only to encounter Guido and get into an altercation on Joel\\'s front lawn before running back into his house. Joel agrees to the women spending one more night. Later that night, Joel, Lana, Vicki, and Joel\\'s friend Barry go out and get high on marijuana. After Lana accidentally undoes the parking brake in the Porsche while retrieving her purse, the car rolls down the hill and onto a pier (despite Joel\\'s desperate attempt to stop it); the pier collapses, and the Porsche sinks into Lake Michigan.\\nWhen Joel takes the car to a repair shop, he is horrified to learn how much it will cost to fix it. He and Lana later decide to turn his parents\\' house into a brothel for a night; Joel\\'s share of the profits will pay for the repairs. The party is a huge success; the house is packed with Joel\\'s friends and classmates and Lana\\'s co-workers. However, the recruiter from Princeton, Rutherford, chooses that night to interview Joel for admission to Princeton. The interview is plagued by interruptions, and Rutherford is unimpressed by Joel\\'s résumé. Afterwards, he stays at the party and becomes acquainted with Lana\\'s friends. After the party, Joel and Lana go and make love on the Chicago \"L\". The next morning, Joel finds his house has been burgled. When he tries to call Lana, Guido answers; he tells Joel that he will let Joel buy back his furniture. Joel and his friends manage to get everything moved back in just as his parents walk in, though his mother notices a crack in her egg. Later, Joel\\'s father congratulates him; the interviewer was very impressed, and Joel will be accepted into Princeton. Joel meets Lana at a restaurant, and they speculate about their future. She tells him that she wants to keep on seeing him; he jokes that it will cost her.\\n\\nCast\\nSoundtrack\\nThe film was scored by Tangerine Dream. Their music comprises nearly half of the soundtrack album. Also included are songs by Muddy Waters, Prince (\"DMSR\"), Jeff Beck, Journey, Phil Collins (\"In the Air Tonight\"), and the song for which the film is best known, \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" by Bob Seger.The soundtrack album was released on Virgin Records, Tangerine Dream\\'s record company at the time of the film\\'s release.The film also includes \"Hungry Heart\" by Bruce Springsteen, \"Every Breath You Take\" by The Police, and \"Swamp\" by Talking Heads. The LP and CD versions of the soundtrack include two different versions of \"Love on a Real Train (Risky Business),\" both of which are different recordings from the version used in the film for the final love scene or closing credits.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nThe film opened in 670 theaters, with an opening weekend gross of $4,275,327. It went on to gross a total of $63.5 million domestically.\\n\\nCritical response\\nRisky Business was acclaimed by critics. It is also considered by many as one of the best films of 1983.Janet Maslin, in her 1983 review of the film for The New York Times, called it \"part satire, part would-be suburban poetry and part shameless showing off\" and said the film \"shows an abundance of style\", though \"you would be hard pressed to find a film whose hero\\'s problems are of less concern to the world at large.\" She called De Mornay \"disarming as a call girl who looks more like a college girl\" and credits Cruise with making \"Joel\\'s transformation from straight arrow to entrepreneur about as credible as it can be made.\"\\nThe film holds a 92% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews, with the site\\'s consensus stating; \"Featuring one of Tom Cruise\\'s best early performances, Risky Business is a sharp, funny examination of teen angst that doesn\\'t stop short of exploring dark themes\". Roger Ebert\\'s review was positive, calling it a film of: New faces and inspired insights and genuine laughs... one of the smartest, funniest, most perceptive satires in a long time... not only invites comparison with The Graduate, it earns it.—The very best thing about the movie is its dialogue. Paul Brickman, who wrote and directed, has an ear so good that he knows what to leave out. This is one of those movies where a few words or a single line says everything that needs to be said, implies everything that needs to be implied, and gets a laugh. When the hooker tells the kid, \\'Oh, Joel, go to school, go learn something,\\' the precise inflection of those words defines their relationship for the next three scenes.\\nVariety said the film was like a \"promising first novel, with all the pros and cons that come with that territory\" and complimented Brickman on \"the stylishness and talent of his direction.\"\\n\\nLegacy\\nThe remastered 25th-anniversary edition offers \"both the upbeat studio ending and Mr. Brickman\\'s original, more tentative and melancholic conclusion\".In 2015, the film was #31 on Entertainment Weekly\\'s list of the 50 Best High School Movies. The magazine called the film a \"sharp satire of privileged suburban teens\", portraying the \"soul-crushing pressure to be perfect.\"In the years since the film\\'s release, the iconic scene featuring Cruise\\'s character sliding across the floor, dancing in just his pink shirt, socks, and white briefs to Bob Seger\\'s rendition of \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" has been recreated in episodes of many television series, as well as in films, parodies, and advertisements. The song was #100 on AFI\\'s 100 Years ... 100 Songs list.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nRisky Business at IMDb\\nRisky Business at Box Office Mojo\\nRisky Business at Rotten Tomatoes\\nRisky Business at Metacritic\\nRisky Business at Discogs (list of releases)',\n",
              " 'Rock of Ages (2012 film)': 'Rock of Ages is a 2012 American jukebox musical comedy film directed by Adam Shankman and based on the rock jukebox Broadway musical Rock of Ages by Chris D\\'Arienzo. Starring country singer Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta leading an ensemble cast that includes Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Malin Åkerman, Mary J. Blige, Bryan Cranston and Tom Cruise, the film features the music of many 1980s rock and Glam Metal artists including Def Leppard, Journey, Scorpions, Poison, Foreigner, Guns N\\' Roses, Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, Bon Jovi, Twisted Sister, Whitesnake, REO Speedwagon, and others.\\nOriginally scheduled to enter production in summer 2009 for a 2011 release, it eventually commenced production in May 2011 and was released on June 15, 2012. The film received mixed critical reviews and grossed only $59 million worldwide. However, Cruise was particularly lauded for his performance of \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" and \"Wanted Dead or Alive\". The related film soundtrack also did critically well, debuting at #1 on the Billboard Top Soundtracks chart.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 1987 Los Angeles, Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) arrives from Oklahoma with dreams of becoming a singer. Barback Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) prepares for another night at The Bourbon Room (\"Sister Christian/Just Like Paradise/Nothin\\' But a Good Time\"). Sherrie\\'s suitcase is stolen, and Drew gets her a job as a waitress at the Bourbon Room.\\nThe club\\'s owner, Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin), and his right-hand man, Lonny Barnett (Russell Brand), are desperate to save the club from a tax debt. They book Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise), a detached and self-indulgent rock star preparing for his final gig with his band, Arsenal. Drew tells Sherrie his own dreams of becoming a rock star, but that he has stagefright (\"Juke Box Hero/I Love Rock \\'n\\' Roll\"). Learning of Stacee\\'s upcoming concert, Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta-Jones), conservative wife of mayor Mike Whitmire (Bryan Cranston), organizes a protest in front of the club (\"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\")\\nDrew and Sherrie have their first date at the Hollywood Sign, where Drew reveals he is writing a song for Sherrie (\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\"). On the night of Arsenal\\'s final show, Dennis learns the opening act has cancelled; Sherrie convinces him to use Drew\\'s band, Wolfgang Von Colt (\"More Than Words/Heaven\"). Stacee\\'s manager, Paul Gill (Paul Giamatti), schedules an interview with Constance Sack (Malin Åkerman), a reporter for Rolling Stone.\\nConstance mentions rumors of Stacee\\'s difficult behavior and implies he was kicked out of Arsenal, which Stacee denies (\"Wanted Dead or Alive\"). Stacee sends Sherrie for a bottle of scotch from his limo. Constance lashes out at the once-great Stacee; they recognize their mutual attraction and are about to have sex when Stacee sings (\"I Want to Know What Love Is\"). Ashamed, Constance leaves as Sherrie enters and collides with Stacee. Drew mistakenly believes that Sherrie and Stacee had sex, and is angrily inspired to sing (\"I Wanna Rock\") for the opening act. Drew and Sherrie break up and she quits the Bourbon Room. Paul, impressed with his performance, offers Drew a record deal as Arsenal sings their last song of the night (\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\").\\nSherrie takes refuge at a strip club, the Venus Club (\"Harden My Heart\"), where owner Justice Charlier (Mary J. Blige) offers her a job as a dancer (\"Shadows of the Night/Harden My Heart\"), but Sherrie chooses to wait tables. She realizes she needs more money, as Drew signs to Gill\\'s record label (\"Here I Go Again\"). Dennis worries the Bourbon Room will close and that he has let everyone down. Lonny confesses his love for him, and Dennis reciprocates (\"Can\\'t Fight This Feeling\"). Drew realizes his record deal makes him part of hip-hop boy band \"The Z Guyeezz\" as Joshie Zee, while Sherrie decides to become a dancer at the Venus Club (\"Any Way You Want It\").\\nSherrie visits the Hollywood Sign, where she finds Drew, whose life has also not gone as planned. She tells him she did not have sex with Stacee and will be returning to Oklahoma. They part ways, lamenting their situation (\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\").\\nStacee realizes his feelings for Constance and calls Rolling Stone to learn that she is covering his show at The Bourbon Room. Stacee rushes to the venue, where Lonny leads the patrons against Patricia\\'s protest group (\"We\\'re Not Gonna Take It/We Built This City\"). Stacee recognizes Patricia, whom Lonny exposes as a former Arsenal groupie. Drew buys back Sherrie\\'s stolen records and drops them off at the strip club.\\nThe Z Guyeezz are rejected by the crowd; Drew spots Sherrie in the audience and leaves the stage. They reconcile, and Drew fires Paul. Sherrie reunites Wolfgang Von Colt onstage, where she and Drew perform the song he wrote for her (\"Don\\'t Stop Believin\\'\"). Stacee, having sex with Constance in the bathroom, is moved by the song.\\nEight months later, Stacee has rejoined Arsenal and performs the song with Drew and Sherrie, now part of Wolfgang Von Colt, at Dodger Stadium in front of a crowd including Dennis, Lonny, Justice, a pregnant Constance, and especially Patricia, who has returned to her rock \\'n\\' roll persona.\\n\\nCast\\nJulianne Hough as Sherrie Christian\\nDiego Boneta as Drew Boley\\nRussell Brand as Lonny Barnett\\nPaul Giamatti as Paul Gill\\nCatherine Zeta-Jones as Patricia Whitmore\\nMalin Åkerman as Constance Sack\\nMary J. Blige as Justice Charlier\\nAlec Baldwin as Dennis Dupree\\nTom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx\\nBryan Cranston as Mayor Mike Whitmore\\nWill Forte as Mitch MileyAdditionally, Kevin Nash and Jeff Chase starred as Jaxx\\'s bodyguards. Constantine Maroulis, who played Drew in the original Broadway cast, appears as the Capitol Records executive during \"Any Way You Want It”. Several musicians also made cameo appearances throughout the film, including Kevin Cronin of REO Speedwagon, Sebastian Bach of Skid Row, Deborah \"Debbie\" Gibson, Nuno Bettencourt, Joel Hoekstra of Night Ranger and Porcelain Black. Eli Roth makes an appearance as Stefano, the Zee Guys\\' music video director, and T. J. Miller cameos as a Rolling Stone receptionist.\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nAfter the success of the original Off-Broadway production, the film rights were sold to Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema in early 2009. Adam Shankman was hired to direct the film in October that year. Chris D\\'Arienzo, creator of the stage musical, revealed he was originally attached to write and direct the film, wishing to have it visualised as similar to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals such as Singin\\' in the Rain, however the studio elected to hire someone they felt they could trust with the budget they wanted to give the film, resulting in Shankman\\'s hiring.\\n\\nCasting\\nTom Cruise played Stacee Jaxx in the film. Shankman knew Cruise was in when he heard him on the first go around of his voice lesson, confirming he \"actually has a fantastic voice.\" Cruise had been singing five hours a day to prepare for his work as musician Stacee Jaxx. \"It\\'s this brilliant mashup, it seems, of Axl Rose, Bret Michaels, Keith Richards and Jim Morrison,\" Shankman said of what to expect from Cruise. All of the actors sing their own parts in the film. Cruise told People Weekly Magazine that he had always wanted to appear in a musical but he found the idea frightening because he was uncertain whether he could actually pull it off.On February 14, 2011, it was announced that Mary J. Blige had signed on to play Justice Charler in the film. On March 3, 2011, it was confirmed that Julianne Hough would play the role of Sherrie, Drew\\'s love interest. On March 6, 2011, it was confirmed that Alec Baldwin would play the role of Dennis Dupree in the film. Baldwin\\'s agreement to star in the film prompted Warner Bros. to have the film fast-tracked. On March 24, 2011, it was announced that Paul Giamatti would be in the film, playing the manager of Stacee Jaxx.Pretty Little Liars star Diego Boneta was confirmed to play the male protagonist, Drew Boley, on April 5, 2011. Not wanting an older actor to act like he is 23, Shankman thought it better to go as authentic as possible, \"and Diego is absolutely that. He is [a] kid who came to Los Angeles with a dream and who sings and has an amazing voice, and drive. And he\\'s also as honest and sweet as you can possibly make him and he\\'s authentically the age. It creates a piece of something on screen that I don\\'t have to fabricate.\" Of Boneta\\'s audition, Shankman said, \"It\\'s that feeling you get when you realized you\\'ve discovered lightning in a bottle. It reminds me of when Zac Efron auditioned for Hairspray, Channing Tatum for Step Up, and Liam Hemsworth auditioned for The Last Song. When the guy walks in, the guy walks in!\" Shankman also said he did not know that Boneta was a Latin music star until after he auditioned. \"I have since seen him on stage and in his concerts, and he totally owns the room,\" Shankman said. Constantine Maroulis (Drew Boley from the musical) made a cameo appearance in the film like Ricki Lake did for Hairspray. On April 13, Russell Brand was confirmed to portray Lonny. Catherine Zeta-Jones joined the cast on April 20, and portrayed an original character added to the story line. The unnamed character is described as \"the Villainess of the movie\" who \"wants to shut down rock’n roll in the great city of Los Angeles.\" On May 1 Bryan Cranston joined the cast as the Mayor of Los Angeles, who is the husband of Catherine Zeta-Jones\\'s character, and Malin Åkerman completed the cast when she was added as Constance Sack on May 3, 2011, a role Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams declined.Singer Porcelain Black made a cameo in the film, playing a 1980s hair metal singer. She performed one of the sole original tracks for the film, \"Rock Angels\". \"Rock Angels\" was written and composed by Adam Anders and Desmond Child. Professional wrestler Kevin Nash played Stacee\\'s bodyguard.\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography began at Revolution Live, a small music venue in Fort Lauderdale. Scenes were shot at a Hollywood, Florida beach on May 24. The scenes at the iconic Hollywood Sign were filmed at the Monarch Hill Renewable Energy Park, known to locals as \"Mount Trashmore\", in Pompano Beach. In June 2011, a full six-block section of N.W. 14th Street in Downtown Miami was decorated as a late 1980s version set of the Hollywood, California Sunset Strip complete with the Whisky-a-Go-Go, Frederick\\'s of Hollywood, Tower Records, Angelyne Billboard along with other landmarks. On July 18, filming took place at the Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Florida, for a concert scene with \"Don\\'t Stop Believin\\'\" and \"Wanted Dead or Alive\".\\n\\nRelease\\nThe film is distributed by New Line Cinema via Warner Bros.. It had its world premiere in Los Angeles on June 8, 2012, where rock bands Def Leppard and Poison performed, and was released theatrically on June 15, 2012.\\n\\nBox office\\nOn its opening weekend in theaters, the film grossed $14,447,269, ranking third place, behind the previous week\\'s holdovers Madagascar 3: Europe\\'s Most Wanted and Prometheus. The film did, however, do slightly better business than the other newcomer, That\\'s My Boy.Rock of Ages was a box office bomb, grossing $38,518,613 in North America and $20,900,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $59,418,613, failing to bring back its $75 million budget. However, the film still has the seventh-highest opening ever for a musical.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, and has a critical score of 42% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 228 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site\\'s consensus states: \"Its exuberant silliness is almost enough to make up for its utter inconsequentiality, but Rock of Ages is ultimately too bland and overlong to justify its trip to the big screen.\" Metacritic reports a 47 out of 100 rating, based on 42 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".Several critics gave praise to the performances, particularly that of Cruise as Stacee Jaxx. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Rock of Ages is pretty fun despite a terrible script, bland leads and awful wigs, mainly thanks to a performance by Tom Cruise as fictional hair metal rocker Stacee Jaxx.\" Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, Amy Biancolli called his performance \"a revelation\", calling it a \"reminder that he\\'s always at his best in wildly transformative character parts\". Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times praised Cruise\\'s singing, and compared his performance to his earlier work as Lestat in Interview with the Vampire. In her review, Dana Stevens of Slate found Cruise\\'s performance the \"boldest use of the actor since Paul Thomas Anderson made him a rage-fueled motivational speaker in Magnolia\".As for the negative reviews, Rex Reed of The New York Observer was heavily critical of every aspect of the film, giving the film no stars out of his ranking of four and compared the film to Battlefield Earth and Howard the Duck. Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw derided the film, and the stage musical, as \"bland and tiring\". Bradshaw also criticized Russell Brand\\'s accent, and gave slight praise to Cruise\\'s performance. Claudia Puig, of USA Today, criticised the main leads of the film as \"deadly dull dreamers\" and the story as \"tame and tone deaf\". Richard Corliss for Time found the cast as being wasted in the film, highlighting Baldwin, Zeta-Jones, Cranston and Cruise, whom Corliss did provide positive reception to his performance.\\nRock of Ages creator Chris D\\'Arienzo, though having not seen the film adaptation, spoke negatively on the final product. \"When the trailer came out, I saw there was a monkey in it, and then I knew what kind of movie it was. And I think America knew what sort of movie it was\". D\\'Arienzo voiced disappointment in how the film depicted itself, stating, Instead of coming from the point of view of \"I\\'m going to validate this and elevate it,\" they embraced the kitsch and just made it more kitschy. They made it more silly and goofy. Not that our show isn\\'t silly or goofy, but it\\'s always from the point of view of \"This is really good. And if you don\\'t like Warrant\\'s \\'Cherry Pie,\\' then you\\'re a fucking dick. Because it\\'s good! And we\\'re gonna show you why it\\'s good!\"\\nAlec Baldwin, who played Dennis Dupree in the film, was also critical, calling it \"a horrible movie\" and \"a complete disaster\". Baldwin had asked New Line Cinema studio head Toby Emmerich to replace him in his role shortly before the start of production.\\n\\nAccolades\\nHome media\\nRock of Ages was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 9, 2012. An extended cut is available on the Blu-ray, which includes the deleted \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" lap dance scene between Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) and Sherrie (Julianne Hough), which is also played in the theatrical version\\'s end credits, as well as an extended version of \"Waiting for a Girl Like You\", between Drew (Diego Boneta) and Sherrie (Hough) (both scenes can also be found on YouTube). The extended cut runs 136 minutes, 13 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and is rated R for sexual content, as opposed to the PG-13 theatrical version.\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe cover and track listing of the soundtrack was confirmed by Entertainment Weekly on April 30, 2012. The soundtrack was released on June 5, 2012.  It debuted at No. 15 on Billboard 200, and peaked at No. 5 on that chart in its third week.  It also debuted at No. 1 on the Top Soundtracks chart.

              " 'Roger Ebert': 'Roger Joseph Ebert (; June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American film critic, film historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author. He was a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. Neil Steinberg of the Chicago Sun-Times said Ebert \"was without question the nation\\'s most prominent and influential film critic,\" Tom Van Riper of Forbes described him as \"the most powerful pundit in America,\" and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called him \"the best-known film critic in America.\"Ebert was known for his intimate, Midwestern writing voice and critical views informed by values of populism and humanism. Writing in a prose style intended to be entertaining and direct, he made sophisticated cinematic and analytical ideas more accessible to nonspecialist audiences. Despite being a populist, Ebert frequently endorsed foreign and independent films he believed would be appreciated by mainstream viewers, which often resulted in such films receiving greater exposure.Ebert and Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel helped popularize nationally televised film reviewing when they co-hosted the PBS show Sneak Previews, followed by several variously named At the Movies programs. The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films. They created and trademarked the phrase \"two thumbs up,\" used when both gave the same film a positive review. After Siskel died in 1999, Ebert continued hosting the show with various co-hosts and then, starting in 2000, with Richard Roeper.\\nEbert was diagnosed with cancer of the thyroid and salivary glands in 2002. In the year 2006, he required treatment that included removal of his lower jaw, leaving him severely disfigured and without the ability to speak or eat normally. However, his ability to write remained unimpaired and he continued to publish frequently online and in print until his death on April 4, 2013.\\n\\nEarly life\\nRoger Joseph Ebert was born in Urbana, Illinois, the only child of Annabel (née Stumm, 1911–1987), a bookkeeper, and Walter Harry Ebert (1901–1960), an electrician. He was raised Roman Catholic, attending St. Mary\\'s elementary school and serving as an altar boy in Urbana.His paternal grandparents were German immigrants and his maternal ancestry was Irish and Dutch. Ebert\\'s interest in journalism began when he was a student at Urbana High School, where he was a sportswriter for The News-Gazette in Champaign, Illinois; however, he began his writing career with letters of comment to the science-fiction fanzines of the era.  In his senior year, he was class president and co-editor of his high school newspaper, The Echo. In 1958, he won the Illinois High School Association state speech championship in \"radio speaking,\" an event that simulates radio newscasts.\\nRegarding his early influences in film criticism, Ebert wrote in the 1998 parody collection Mad About the Movies:I learned to be a movie critic by reading Mad magazine ... Mad\\'s parodies made me aware of the machine inside the skin – of the way a movie might look original on the outside, while inside it was just recycling the same old dumb formulas. I did not read the magazine, I plundered it for clues to the universe. Pauline Kael lost it at the movies; I lost it at Mad magazine.\\nEbert began taking classes at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign as an early-entrance student, completing his high school courses while also taking his first university class. After graduating from Urbana High School in 1960, Ebert then attended and received his undergraduate degree in 1964. While at the University of Illinois, Ebert worked as a reporter for The Daily Illini and then served as its editor during his senior year while also continuing to work as a reporter for the News-Gazette of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. (He had begun at the News-Gazette at age 15 covering Urbana High School sports.) As an undergraduate, he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and president of the U.S. Student Press Association. One of the first movie reviews he ever wrote was a review of La Dolce Vita, published in The Daily Illini in October 1961.Ebert spent a semester as a master\\'s student in the department of English there before attending the University of Cape Town on a Rotary fellowship for a year. He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies at Illinois for two more semesters and then, after being accepted as a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago, he prepared to move to Chicago. He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the Chicago Daily News, hoping that, as he had already sold freelance pieces to the Daily News, including an article on the death of writer Brendan Behan, he would be hired by editor Herman Kogan. Instead Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim Hoge, who hired Ebert as a reporter and feature writer at the Sun-Times in 1966. He attended doctoral classes at the University of Chicago while working as a general reporter at the Sun-Times for a year. After movie critic Eleanor Keane left the Sun-Times in April 1967, editor Robert Zonka gave the job to Ebert. The load of graduate school and being a film critic proved too much, so Ebert left the University of Chicago to focus his energies on film criticism.\\n\\nCareer\\nWriting\\nEbert began his career as a film critic in 1967, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times. That same year, he met film critic Pauline Kael for the first time at the New York Film Festival. After he sent her some of his columns, she told him they were \"the best film criticism being done in American newspapers today.\" That same year, Ebert\\'s first book, a history of the University of Illinois titled Illini Century: One Hundred Years of Campus Life, was published by the University\\'s press. In 1969, his review of Night of the Living Dead was published in Reader\\'s Digest. In addition to film, Ebert would occasionally write about other topics for the Sun-Times, such as music; In 1970, Ebert wrote the first published concert review of singer-songwriter John Prine, who at the time was working as a mailman and performing at Chicago folk clubs.\\n\\nEbert co-wrote the screenplay for the Russ Meyer film Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970) and sometimes joked about being responsible for the film, which was poorly received on its release yet has become a cult film. Ebert and Meyer also made  Up! (1976), Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens (1979), and other films, and were involved in the ill-fated Sex Pistols movie Who Killed Bambi? (In April 2010, Ebert posted his screenplay of Who Killed Bambi?, aka Anarchy in the UK, on his blog.)Beginning in 1968, Ebert worked for the University of Chicago as an adjunct lecturer, teaching a night class on film at the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies.In 1975, Ebert received the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.In October 1986, while continuing to work for the Sun-Times and still being based in Chicago, Ebert replaced Rex Reed as the New York Post chief film reviewer.As of 2007, his reviews were syndicated to more than 200 newspapers in the United States and abroad. Ebert also published more than 20 books and dozens of collected reviews.\\nEven as he used TV (and later the internet) to share his reviews, Ebert continued to write for the Chicago Sun-Times until he died in 2013.\\n\\nTV career\\nAlso in 1975, Ebert and Gene Siskel began co-hosting a weekly film-review television show, Sneak Previews, which was locally produced by the Chicago public broadcasting station WTTW. The series was later picked up for national syndication on PBS. The duo became well known for their \"thumbs up/thumbs down\" review summaries. Siskel and Ebert trademarked the phrase \"Two Thumbs Up.\"In 1982, they moved from PBS to launch a similar syndicated commercial television show named At the Movies With Gene Siskel & Roger Ebert. In 1986, they again moved the show to new ownership, creating Siskel & Ebert & the Movies through Buena Vista Television, part of the Walt Disney Company.\\nAfter Siskel died in 1999, the producers retitled the show Roger Ebert & the Movies and used rotating co-hosts including Martin Scorsese, A.O. Scott, and Janet Maslin.\\nIn September 2000, Chicago Sun-Times columnist Richard Roeper became the permanent co-host and the show was renamed At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper and later At the Movies.\\nIn 2000, Ebert interviewed President Bill Clinton at The White House. Clinton spoke about his love for the movies, his favorite films of 1999, and of all time which include Casablanca (1942), High Noon (1952) and The Ten Commandments (1956). President Clinton also mentioned his favorite actors being Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, and Tom Hanks.In 2005, Ebert became the first film critic to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\\n\\nLater career\\nEbert ended his association with the Disney-owned At The Movies in July 2008, after the studio indicated it wished to take the program in a new direction. On February 18, 2009, Ebert reported that he and Roeper would soon announce a new movie-review program, and reiterated this plan after Disney announced that the program\\'s last episode would air in August 2010.On January 31, 2009, Ebert was made an honorary life member of the Directors Guild of America. His final television series, Ebert Presents: At the Movies, premiered on January 21, 2011, with Ebert contributing a review voiced by Bill Kurtis in a brief segment called \"Roger\\'s Office,\" as well as featuring more traditional film reviews in the \"At the Movies\" format presented by Christy Lemire and Ignatiy Vishnevetsky.\\nThe last review Ebert wrote was for the film To the Wonder, which he gave 3.5 out of 4 stars in a review for the Chicago Sun-Times. It was published on April 6, 2013. In July 2013, a previously unpublished review of the film Computer Chess appeared on Ebert\\'s website. The review had been written in March but had remained unpublished until the film\\'s wide-release date. Matt Zoller Seitz, the editor for Ebert\\'s website, confirmed that there were other unpublished reviews that would be eventually uploaded to the website. A second posthumously published review, for The Spectacular Now, was published in August 2013.\\n\\nFilm and TV appearances\\nIn 1995, Ebert, along with colleague Gene Siskel, guest-starred on an episode of the animated TV series The Critic. In the episode, Siskel and Ebert split and each wants Jay as his new partner. The episode is a parody of the film Sleepless in Seattle. The following year, Ebert appeared in Pitch, a documentary by Canadian film makers Spencer Rice and Kenny Hotz. He made an appearance as himself in a 1997 episode of the television series Early Edition, which took place in Chicago. In the episode, Ebert consoles a young boy who is depressed after he sees a character called Bosco the Bunny die in a movie.In 1999, Roger Ebert founded his own film festival, Ebertfest, in his home town of Champaign, Illinois. He was also a regular fixture at the Hawaii International Film Festival.\\nIn 2003, Ebert made a cameo appearance in the film Abby Singer. On May 4, 2010, Ebert was announced by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences as the Webby Person of the Year, having taken to the internet following his battle with cancer. On October 22, 2010, Ebert appeared on camera with Robert Osborne on the Turner Classic Movies network during the network\\'s \"The Essentials\" series. Ebert chose the films Sweet Smell of Success and The Lady Eve to be shown.For many years, on the day of the Academy Awards ceremony, Ebert appeared with Roeper on the live pre-awards show, An Evening at the Academy Awards: The Arrivals. This aired for over a decade, usually prior to the awards ceremony show, which also featured red carpet interviews and fashion commentary. They also used to appear on the post-awards show entitled An Evening at the Academy Awards: The Winners, produced and aired by the ABC-owned KABC-TV in Los Angeles.Ebert was one of the principal critics featured in Gerald Peary\\'s 2009 documentary film For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism. He is shown discussing the dynamics of appearing with Gene Siskel on the 1970s show Coming to a Theatre Near You, which was the predecessor of Sneak Previews on Chicago PBS station WTTW. He also expressed his approval of the proliferation of young people writing film reviews today on the internet.Ebert provided DVD audio commentaries for several films, including Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Dark City, Floating Weeds, Crumb, and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (for which Ebert also wrote the screenplay, based on a story that he co-wrote with Russ Meyer). Ebert was also interviewed by Central Park Media for an extra feature on the DVD release of the anime film Grave of the Fireflies. Ebert appeared as a guest star multiple times on Sesame Street. A bio-documentary about Ebert, called Life Itself, was released in 2014 to universal acclaim.Though not making a personal appearance, an honorary effigy of Ebert co-starred in the 1998 reimagined version of Godzilla, played by actor Michael Lerner as New York City Mayor Ebert.\\n\\nCritical style\\nEbert described his critical approach to films as \"relative, not absolute\"; he reviewed a film for what he thought it would be to its prospective audience, yet always with at least some consideration as to its value as a whole. He awarded four stars to films of the highest quality, and generally a half star to those of the lowest, unless he considered the film to be \"artistically inept and morally repugnant,\" in which case it received no stars.\\nWhen you ask a friend if Hellboy is any good, you\\'re not asking if it\\'s any good compared to Mystic River, you\\'re asking if it\\'s any good compared to The Punisher. And my answer would be, on a scale of one to four, if Superman is four, then Hellboy is three and The Punisher is two. In the same way, if American Beauty gets four stars, then The United States of Leland clocks in at about two.\\nMetacritic later noted that Ebert tended to give more lenient ratings than most critics. His average film rating was 71%, if translated into a percentage, compared to 59% for the site as a whole. Of his reviews, 75% were positive and 75% of his ratings were better than his colleagues. Ebert had acknowledged in 2008 that he gave higher ratings on average than other critics, though he said this was in part because he considered a rating of 3 out of 4 stars to be the general threshold for a film to get a \"thumbs up.\" Although Ebert rarely wrote outright-scathing reviews, he had a reputation for writing memorable ones for the films he really disliked, such as North.Ebert emphasized that his star ratings had little meaning if not considered in the context of the review itself. Occasionally, Ebert\\'s star rating may have seemed at odds with his written opinion. Ebert acknowledged one such case in his review of Basic Instinct 2, which he gave 1.5 stars, and about which he wrote \"I cannot recommend the movie, but ... why the hell can\\'t I? Just because it\\'s godawful? What kind of reason is that of staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, that would be a reason.\" In his review of The Manson Family, Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that did not count as a recommendation per se. He similarly gave the Adam Sandler–starring remake of The Longest Yard a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the Cannes Film Festival, he recommended readers not to see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences. He declined to give a star rating to The Human Centipede, arguing that the rating system was \"unsuited\" to such a film: \"Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don\\'t shine.\"Ebert\\'s reviews were also characterized by what has been called \"dry wit.\" In August 2005, after Rob Schneider insulted Los Angeles Times movie critic Patrick Goldstein (who had criticized Schneider\\'s film Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo) by commenting that Goldstein was unqualified because he had never won the Pulitzer Prize, Ebert intervened by stating that, as a Pulitzer winner, he was qualified to review the film, and bluntly told Schneider, \"Your movie sucks.\" Ebert and Schneider would later reconcile regarding this matter.He often included personal anecdotes in his reviews when he considered them relevant. He occasionally wrote reviews in the forms of stories, poems, songs, scripts, open letters, or imagined conversations. He wrote many essays and articles exploring in depth the field of film criticism (see Bibliography in this article). Will Sloan argued that the reason for Ebert\\'s popularity was that he struck a balance between being respected among film scholars and appealing to a wide audience. For example, he noted how Ebert and Siskel may have given \"thumbs up/thumbs down\" verdicts on their show, but they also used the show to promote foreign and independent cinema.In his appearances on The Howard Stern Show, he was frequently challenged to defend his ratings. Ebert stood by his opinions with one notable exception: when Stern pointed out that Ebert had given The Godfather Part II a three-star rating in 1974, but had subsequently given The Godfather Part III three and a half stars. Ebert later added The Godfather Part II to his \"Great Movies\" list in October 2008 stating that his original review has often been cited as proof of his \"worthlessness\" but he still had not changed his mind and would not change a word of his original review. When reviewing the 2009 remake of The Last House on the Left, Ebert noted how he had given the controversial 1972 original three and a half stars and declined to make a comparison between the two versions: \"I wrote that original \\'Last House\\' review 37 years ago. I am not the same person. I am uninterested in being \\'consistent\\'.\"\\n\\nPreferences\\nFavorites\\nEbert indicated that his favorite film was Citizen Kane, joking, \"That\\'s the official answer,\" although he preferred to emphasize it as \"the most important\" film. He insinuated that his real favorite film was La Dolce Vita. His favorite actor was Robert Mitchum, and his favorite actress was Ingrid Bergman. He also considered Buster Keaton, Robert Altman, Werner Herzog, and Martin Scorsese to be his favorite directors. He expressed his general distaste for \"top-10\" lists, and all movie lists in general, but contributed a top-10 list to the 2012 Sight and Sound Critics\\' poll. Listed alphabetically, those films were 2001: A Space Odyssey; Aguirre, the Wrath of God; Apocalypse Now; Citizen Kane; La Dolce Vita; The General; Raging Bull; Tokyo Story; The Tree of Life; and Vertigo. His favorite Bond film was Goldfinger (1964), and he later added it to his \"Great Movies\" list.\\n\\nBest films of the year\\nEbert compiled \"best of the year\" movie lists beginning in 1967 until 2012, thereby helping provide an overview of his critical preferences.  His top choices were:\\n\\nEbert revisited and sometimes revised his opinions. After ranking E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial third on his 1982 list, it was the only movie from that year to appear on his later \"Best Films of the 1980s\" list (where it also ranked third). He made similar reevaluations of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Ran (1985). Three Colours trilogy (Blue (1993), White (1994), and Red (also 1994)), and Pulp Fiction (1994) originally ranked second and third on Ebert\\'s 1994 list; both were included on his \"Best Films of the 1990s\" list, but their order had reversed.In 2006, Ebert noted his own \"tendency to place what I now consider the year\\'s best film in second place, perhaps because I was trying to make some kind of point with my top pick,\" adding, \"In 1968, I should have ranked 2001 above The Battle of Algiers.  In 1971, McCabe & Mrs. Miller was better than The Last Picture Show.  In 1974, Chinatown was probably better, in a different way, than Scenes from a Marriage.  In 1976, how could I rank Small Change above Taxi Driver?  In 1978, I would put Days of Heaven above An Unmarried Woman. And in 1980, of course, Raging Bull was a better film than The Black Stallion ... although I later chose Raging Bull as the best film of the entire decade of the 1980s, it was only the second-best film of 1980 ... am I the same person I was in 1968, 1971, or 1980? I hope not.\"\\nSince Ebert died, his website has continued the practice, with the site\\'s primary contributors each offering individual top-10 lists, with their rankings combined into a communal top-10 list.\\n\\nGenres and content\\nEbert was often critical of the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system (MPAA). His main arguments were that they were too strict on sex and profanity, too lenient on violence, secretive with their guidelines, inconsistent in applying them and not willing to consider the wider context and meaning of the film. He advocated replacing the NC-17 rating with separate ratings for pornographic and nonpornographic adult films.Ebert also frequently lamented that cinemas outside major cities are \"booked by computer from Hollywood with no regard for local tastes,\" making high-quality independent and foreign films virtually unavailable to most American moviegoers.Some horror movie fans accused Ebert of elitism and prejudice against the horror genre, especially because of his dismissive comments about \"Dead Teenager Movies.\" In 2007, Ebert responded to a question from a horror movie reviewer by saying that he did not disparage horror movies as a whole. He wrote that he drew a distinction between films like Nosferatu and The Silence of the Lambs, which he regarded as \"masterpieces,\" and those that had no content other than teenagers being killed.Ebert occasionally accused some films of having an unwholesome political agenda, such as his assertion that the film Dirty Harry (1971) had a fascist moral position. He was wary of films passed off as art, which he saw as lurid and sensational. He leveled this charge against such films as The Night Porter (1974).Ebert commented on films using his Catholic upbringing as a point of reference, and was critical of films he believed were grossly ignorant of or insulting to Catholicism, such as Stigmata (1999) and Priest (1994). He also gave favorable reviews of controversial films with themes or references to Jesus and Catholicism, including The Passion of the Christ (2004), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and to Kevin Smith\\'s religious satire Dogma (1999). Ebert was described as an agnostic in 2005, but preferred not being \"pigeon-holed.\"\\n\\nContrarian reviews\\nWriting in an online magazine Hazlitt about Ebert\\'s reviews, Will Sloan argued that \"[t]here were inevitably movies where he veered from consensus, but he was not provocative or idiosyncratic by nature.\" One example of Ebert dissenting with other critics was his one-star review of the celebrated 1986 David Lynch film Blue Velvet (\"marred by sophomoric satire and cheap shots ... in a way, [director Lynch\\'s] behavior is more sadistic than the Hopper character\"). He also gave a one-star review to the critically acclaimed Abbas Kiarostami film Taste of Cherry, which won the Palme d\\'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. Ebert later went on to add the film to a list of his most-hated movies of all time. He was dismissive of the popular 1988 Bruce Willis action film Die Hard (\"inappropriate and wrongheaded interruptions reveal the fragile nature of the plot\"), while his positive 3 out of 4 stars review of 1997\\'s Speed 2: Cruise Control (\"Movies like this embrace goofiness with an almost sensual pleasure\") is one of only three positive reviews accounting for that film\\'s 4% approval rating on the reviewer aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes (one of the two others having been written by his At the Movies co-star Gene Siskel).\\n\\nOther interests\\nEbert was an admirer of director Werner Herzog, whom he supported through many years when Herzog\\'s popularity had declined. He conducted an onstage public \"conversation\" with Herzog at the Telluride Film Festival in 2004, after a screening of Herzog\\'s film Invincible at Roger Ebert\\'s Overlooked Film Festival. Herzog dedicated his film Encounters at the End of the World (2008) to Ebert, and Ebert responded with a heartfelt public letter of gratitude. Herzog said he once exhorted Ebert to watch the television reality sitcom The Anna Nicole Show, featuring the former Playboy Playmate, so he could gain a better understanding of the decline in American culture. Ebert did watch it.Ebert was also an advocate and supporter of Asian-American cinema, famously coming to the defense of the cast and crew of Justin Lin\\'s Better Luck Tomorrow (2002) during a Sundance Film Festival screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian-Americans and Americans. Ebert responded that \"nobody would say such a thing to a bunch of white filmmakers: How could you do this to \\'your people\\'? ... Asian-American characters have the right to be whoever the hell they want to be. They do not have to represent \\'their people\\'!\" He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance, and also supported a number of Asian-American films, having them also screen at his film festival (such as Eric Byler\\'s Charlotte Sometimes).\\n\\nViews on technology\\nEbert was a strong advocate for Maxivision 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, as compared to the usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theaters lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see. Ebert was skeptical of the resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.In 2005, Ebert opined that video games are not art, and are inferior to media created through authorial control, such as film and literature, stating, \"video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated, challenging and visually wonderful,\" but \"the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art.\" This resulted in negative reaction from video game enthusiasts, such as writer Clive Barker, who defended video games as an art form. Ebert wrote a further piece in response to Barker. Ebert maintained his position in 2010, but conceded that he should not have expressed this skepticism without being more familiar with the actual experience of playing them. He admitted that he barely played video games: \"I have played Cosmology of Kyoto which I enormously enjoyed, and Myst for which I lacked the patience.\"\\n\\nPersonal life\\nAt age 50, Ebert married trial attorney Charlie \"Chaz\" Hammelsmith (formerly Chaz Hammel-Smith) in 1992. He explained in his memoir, Life Itself, that he \"would never marry before [his] mother died,\" as he was afraid of displeasing her. In a July 2012 blog entry titled \"Roger loves Chaz,\" Ebert wrote, \"She fills my horizon, she is the great fact of my life, she has my love, she saved me from the fate of living out my life alone, which is where I seemed to be heading.\" Chaz Ebert became vice president of the Ebert Company and has emceed Ebertfest.Ebert was a recovering alcoholic, having quit drinking in 1979. He was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous and had written some blog entries on the subject. Ebert dated Oprah Winfrey and was a longtime friend of hers. Winfrey credited him with persuading her to syndicate The Oprah Winfrey Show, which became the highest-rated talk show in American television history. He was also friends with film historian and critic Leonard Maltin, and considered the book Leonard Maltin\\'s Movie and Video Guide (final update in 2014) to be the standard of film guide books.\\n\\nA supporter of the Democratic Party, Ebert publicly urged liberal filmmaker Michael Moore to give a politically charged acceptance speech at the Academy Awards: \"I\\'d like to see Michael Moore get up there and let \\'em have it with both barrels and really let loose and give them a real rabble-rousing speech.\" During a 1996 panel at the University of Colorado Boulder\\'s Conference on World Affairs, Ebert coined the Boulder Pledge, by which he vowed never to purchase anything offered through the result of an unsolicited email message, or to forward chain emails or mass emails to others. Ebert endorsed Barack Obama for re-election as president in 2012.Ebert was critical of intelligent design, and stated that people who believe in either creationism or New Age beliefs such as crystal healing or astrology are not qualified to be president. Ebert also expressed disbelief in pseudoscientific or supernatural claims in general, calling them \"woo-woo,\" though he has argued that reincarnation is possible from a \"scientific, rationalist point of view.\"Discussing his beliefs, in 2009, Ebert wrote that he did not \"want to provide a category for people to apply to [him]\" because he \"would not want [his] convictions reduced to a word,\" and stated, \"I have never said, although readers have freely informed me I am an atheist, an agnostic, or at the very least a secular humanist – which I am.\" In the same blog entry, he also said \"I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still awake at night, asking how? I am more content with the question than I would be with an answer.\" In March 2013, he wrote: \"I support freedom of choice. My choice is to not support abortion, except in cases of a clear-cut choice between the lives of the mother and child. A child conceived through incest or rape is innocent and deserves the right to be born.\" He also stated: \"I consider myself Catholic, lock, stock, and barrel, with this technical loophole: I cannot believe in God. I refuse to call myself an atheist, however, because that indicates too great a certainty about the unknowable\". He had previously identified as Catholic in his reviews of movies about Jesus, most notably in his review of Gibson\\'s The Passion.On April 25, 2011, he achieved one of his long-time goals: winning one of the weekly cartoon-caption contests in The New Yorker after more than 100 attempts.\\n\\nHealth\\nIn early 2002, Ebert was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer which was successfully removed in February. In 2003, he underwent surgery for cancer in his salivary gland, which was followed up by radiation therapy. He was again afflicted with cancer in 2006. In June of that year, he had surgery to remove cancerous tissue near his right jaw. A week later he had a life-threatening complication when his carotid artery burst near the surgery site. He was confined to bed rest and was unable to speak, eat, or drink for a time, necessitating the use of a feeding tube.The complications kept Ebert off the air for an extended period. Ebert made his first public appearance since mid-2006 at Ebertfest on April 25, 2007. He was unable to speak, instead communicating through his wife. He returned to reviewing on May 18, 2007, when three of his reviews were published in print. In July 2007, he revealed that he was still unable to speak. Ebert adopted a computerized voice system to communicate, eventually using a copy of his own voice created from his recordings by CereProc. In March 2010, his health trials and new computerized voice were featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Ebert later proposed a test to determine the realism of a synthesized voice.Ebert underwent further surgery in January 2008 to try and restore his voice and address the complications from his previous surgeries. On April 1, Ebert announced his speech had not been restored. A further surgery was performed in April 2008 after Ebert fractured his hip in a fall. By 2011, Ebert was using a prosthetic chin to hide some of the damage done by his many chin, mouth, and throat surgeries.In December 2012, Ebert was hospitalized due to the fractured hip, which was subsequently determined to be the result of cancer.\\n\\nDeath\\nThree years before his death, Ebert wrote: I know it is coming, and I do not fear it, because I believe there is nothing on the other side of death to fear. I hope to be spared as much pain as possible on the approach path. I was perfectly content before I was born, and I think of death as the same state. What I am grateful for is the gift of intelligence, and for life, love, wonder, and laughter. You can\\'t say it wasn\\'t interesting. My lifetime\\'s memories are what I have brought home from the trip. I will require them for eternity no more than that little souvenir of the Eiffel Tower I brought home from Paris.\\nOn April 4, 2013, Ebert died at age 70 at a hospital in Chicago, shortly before he was set to return to his home and enter hospice care. Reaction came from celebrities both in and out of the entertainment industry. Former President Barack Obama wrote, \"Roger was the movies ... [he could capture] the unique power of the movies to take us somewhere magical. ... The movies won\\'t be the same without Roger.\" Steven Spielberg stated that Ebert\\'s \"reviews went far deeper than simply thumbs up or thumbs down. He wrote with passion through a real knowledge of film and film history, and in doing so, helped many movies find their audiences. ... [He] put television criticism on the map.\" Martin Scorsese released a statement saying, \"The death of Roger Ebert is an incalculable loss for movie culture and for film criticism. And it\\'s a loss for me personally ... there was a professional distance between us, but then I could talk to him much more freely than I could to other critics. Really, Roger was my friend. It\\'s that simple.\" Robert Redford called Ebert \"one of the great champions of freedom of artistic expression\" and said, \"His personal passion for cinema was boundless, and that is sure to be his legacy for generations to come.\" Christopher Nolan said of Ebert, \"He never became jaded… even while bringing a very thoughtful critical eye.\"Hundreds of people attended the funeral Mass held at Chicago\\'s Holy Name Cathedral on April 8, 2013, where Ebert was celebrated as a film critic, newspaperman, advocate for social justice, and husband. Father Michael Pfleger concluded the service with \"the balconies of heaven are filled with angels singing \\'Thumbs Up\\' \".\\n\\nMemorials and legacy\\nA 2hr 45min public tribute, entitled Roger Ebert: A Celebration of Life, was held on April 11, 2013, at the Chicago Theatre. It featured in-person remembrances, video testimonials, video and film clips, and gospel choirs, and was, according to the Chicago Tribune\\'s Mark Caro, \"a laughter- and sorrow-filled send-off from the entertainment and media worlds.\"In September 2013, organizers in Champaign, Illinois, announced plans to raise $125,000 to build a life-size bronze statue of Ebert in the town, which was unveiled in front of the Virginia Theatre at Ebertfest on April 24, 2014. The composition was selected by his widow, Chaz Ebert, and depicts Ebert sitting in the middle of three theater seats giving a \"thumbs up.\"The 2013 Toronto International Film Festival opened with a video tribute of Ebert at Roy Thomson Hall during the world premiere of the WikiLeaks-based film The Fifth Estate. Ebert had been an avid supporter of the festival since its inception in the 1970s. Chaz was in attendance to accept a plaque on Roger\\'s behalf.At the 86th Academy Awards ceremony, Ebert was included in the In Memoriam montage, a rare honor for a film critic.In 2014, the documentary Life Itself was released. Director Steve James, whose films had been widely advocated by Ebert, started making it while the critic was still alive. Martin Scorsese served as an executive producer. The film studies Ebert\\'s life and career, while also filming Ebert during his final months, and includes interviews with his family and friends. It was universally praised by critics. It has a 97% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.Ebert was inducted as a laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois. In 2001, he was awarded the highest honor in Illinois, the Order of Lincoln, by the governor of Illinois in the area of performing arts. In 2016, Ebert was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.The website RogerEbert.com contains an archive of every review Ebert wrote, as well as many essays and opinion pieces. The site, now operated by Ebert Digital (a partnership between Chaz and friend Josh Golden), continues to publish new material written by a group of critics who were selected by Ebert before his death.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\nEbert received many awards during his long and distinguished career as a film critic and television host. In 2003, Ebert was honored by the American Society of Cinematographers winning a Special Achievement Award. In 2005, Ebert received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work on television. His star is located at 6834 Hollywood Blvd. In 2009, Ebert received the Directors Guild of America Award\\'s for Honorary Life Member Award. In 2010, Ebert received the Webby Award for Person of the Year.In 2007, Ebert was honored by the Gotham Awards receiving a tribute and award for his lifetime contributions to independent film.On May 15, 2009, Ebert was honored by the American Pavilion at the Cannes Film Festival by the renaming of its conference room, \"The Roger Ebert Conference Center.\" Martin Scorsese joined Ebert, and his wife Chaz at the ribbon cutting ceremony.\\nHonors\\n\\n1995 - Publicists Guild of America Press Award\\n2003 - American Society of Cinematographers\\'s Special Achievement Award\\n2004 - Savannah Film Festival\\'s Lifetime Achievement Award\\n2007 - Gotham Award\\'s Lifetime Achievement Award\\n2009 - Directors Guild of America Award\\' Honorary Life Member Award\\n2010 - Webby Award for Person of the Year\\n\\nBibliography\\nEach year from 1986 to 1998, Ebert published Roger Ebert\\'s Movie Home Companion (retitled Roger Ebert\\'s Video Companion for its last five installments), which collected all of his movie reviews to that point. From 1999 to 2013 (except in 2008), Ebert instead published Roger Ebert\\'s Movie Yearbook, a collection of all of his movie reviews from the previous two and a half years (for example, the 2011 edition, ISBN 978-0-7407-9769-9, covers January 2008 – July 2010.)

              " 'Rolling Stone': 'Rolling Stone is an American monthly magazine that focuses on music, politics, and popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco, California, in 1967 by Jann Wenner, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its coverage of rock music and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine broadened and shifted its focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. It has since returned to its traditional mix of content, including music, entertainment, and politics.\\nThe first magazine was released in 1967 and featured John Lennon on the cover and was published every two weeks. It is known for provocative photography and its cover photos, featuring musicians, politicians, athletes, and actors. In addition to its print version in the United States, it publishes content through Rollingstone.com and numerous international editions.\\nPenske Media Corporation is the current owner of Rolling Stone, purchasing 51 percent of the magazine in 2017 and the remaining 49 percent in 2019.\\n\\nHistory\\n1967 to 1979: Founding and early history\\nRolling Stone was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner and Ralph Gleason. To get it off the ground, Wenner borrowed $7,500 from his own family and from the parents of his soon-to-be wife, Jane Schindelheim. The first issue was released on November 9, 1967, and featured John Lennon in costume for the film How I Won the War on the cover. It was in newspaper format with a lead article on the Monterey Pop Festival. The cover price was 25¢ (equivalent to $1.92 in 2016) and it was published bi-weekly.\\nIn the first issue, Wenner explained that the title of the magazine referred to the 1950 blues song \"Rollin\\' Stone\", recorded by Muddy Waters, and Bob Dylan\\'s 1965 hit single \"Like a Rolling Stone\":\\n\\nYou\\'re probably wondering what we\\'re trying to do. It\\'s hard to say: sort of a magazine and sort of a newspaper. The name of it is Rolling Stone which comes from an old saying, \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\"\\nMuddy Waters used the name for a song he wrote. The Rolling Stones took their name from Muddy\\'s song. \"Like a Rolling Stone\" was the title of Bob Dylan\\'s first rock and roll record. We have begun a new publication reflecting what we see are the changes in rock and roll and the changes related to rock and roll.\"}} Some authors have attributed the name solely to Dylan\\'s hit single: \"At [Ralph] Gleason\\'s suggestion, Wenner named his magazine after a Bob Dylan song.\"  Rolling Stone initially identified with and reported the hippie counterculture of the era. However, it distanced itself from the underground newspapers of the time, such as Berkeley Barb, embracing more traditional journalistic standards and avoiding the radical politics of the underground press. In the first edition, Wenner wrote that Rolling Stone \"is not just about the music, but about the things and attitudes that music embraces\". In a 2017 article celebrating the publication\\'s 50th anniversary, Rolling Stone\\'s David Browne stated that the magazine\\'s name was a nod to the Rolling Stones in an addition to \"Rollin\\' Stone\" and \"Like a Rolling Stone\".The magazine\\'s long-running slogan, \"All the news that fits\", was provided by early contributor, manager and sometime editor Susan Lydon. She lifted it from an April Fools issue of the Columbia Daily Spectator which posted \"All the news that fits we print\", a parody of The New York Times\\' slogan, \"All the News That\\'s Fit to Print\". The first appearance of the rubric was in 1969.In the 1970s, Rolling Stone began to make a mark with its political coverage, with the likes of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson writing for the magazine\\'s political section. Thompson first published his most famous work Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas within the pages of Rolling Stone, where he remained a contributing editor until his death in 2005. In the 1970s, the magazine also helped launch the careers of many prominent authors, including Cameron Crowe, Lester Bangs, Joe Klein, Joe Eszterhas, Ben Fong-Torres, Patti Smith and P. J. O\\'Rourke. It was at this point that the magazine ran some of its most famous stories. The January 21, 1970, issue covered the Altamont Free Concert and the death of Meredith Hunter which won a Specialized Journalism award at the National Magazine Awards in 1971. Later in 1970, Rolling Stone published a 30,000-word feature on Charles Manson by David Dalton and David Felton, including their interview of Manson when he was in the LA County Jail awaiting trial, which won Rolling Stone its first National Magazine Award. Four years later, they also covered the Patty Hearst abduction odyssey. One interviewer, speaking for many his peers, said that he bought his first copy of the magazine upon initial arrival on his college campus, describing it as a \"rite of passage\".In 1972, Wenner assigned Tom Wolfe to cover the launch of NASA\\'s last Moon mission, Apollo 17. He published a four-part series in 1973 titled \"Post-Orbital Remorse\", about the depression that some astronauts experienced after having been in space. After the series, Wolfe began researching the whole of the space program, in what became a seven-year project from which he took time to write The Painted Word, a book on art, and to complete Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine, a collection of shorter pieces and eventually The Right Stuff.\\nRolling Stone recruited writers from smaller music magazines, including Paul Nelson from Sing Out!, who became record reviews editor from 1978 to 1983, and Dave Marsh from Creem.In 1977, the magazine moved its headquarters from San Francisco to New York City. Editor Jann Wenner said San Francisco had become \"a cultural backwater\".\\n\\n1980 to 1999: Change to entertainment magazine\\nKurt Loder joined Rolling Stone in May 1979 and spent 9 years there, including as editor. Timothy White joined as a writer from Crawdaddy and David Fricke from Musician. Tom Wolfe wrote to Wenner to propose an idea drawn from Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray: to serialize a novel. Wenner offered Wolfe around $200,000 to serialize his work. The frequent deadline pressure gave Wolfe the motivation he had sought, and from July 1984 to August 1985, he published a new installment in each biweekly issue of Rolling Stone. Later Wolfe was unhappy with his \"very public first draft\" and thoroughly revised his work, even changing his protagonist, Sherman McCoy, and published it as The Bonfire of the Vanities in 1987.\\nRolling Stone was known for its musical coverage and for Thompson\\'s political reporting and in 1985, they hired an advertising agency to refocus its image under the series \"Perception/Reality\" comparing Sixties symbols to those of the Eighties, which led to an increase in advertising revenue and pages. It also shifted to more of an entertainment magazine in the 1980s. It still had music as the main topic but began to increase its coverage of celebrities, films, and pop culture. It also began releasing its annual \"Hot Issue.\" In the 1990s, the magazine changed its format to appeal to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. This led to criticism that the magazine was emphasizing style over substance.\\n\\n2000 to 2015: Expansion of readership\\nAfter years of declining readership, the magazine experienced a major resurgence of interest and relevance with the work of two young journalists in the late 2000s, Michael Hastings and Matt Taibbi. Rob Sheffield also joined from Spin.In 2005, Dana Leslie Fields, former publisher of Rolling Stone, who had worked at the magazine for 17 years, was an inaugural inductee into the Magazine Hall of Fame.In 2009, Taibbi unleashed an acclaimed series of scathing reports on the financial meltdown of the time. He famously described Goldman Sachs as \"a great vampire squid\".Bigger headlines came at the end of June 2010. Rolling Stone caused a controversy in the White House by publishing in the July issue an article by journalist Michael Hastings entitled, \"The Runaway General\", quoting criticism by General Stanley A. McChrystal, commander of the International Security Assistance Force and U.S. Forces-Afghanistan commander, about Vice President Joe Biden and other Administration members of the White House. McChrystal resigned from his position shortly after his statements went public.In 2010, Taibbi documented illegal and fraudulent actions by banks in the foreclosure courts, after traveling to Jacksonville, Florida and sitting in on hearings in the courtroom. His article, Invasion of the Home Snatchers, also documented attempts by the judge to intimidate a homeowner fighting foreclosure and the attorney Taibbi accompanied into the court.In January 2012, the magazine ran exclusive excerpts from Hastings\\' book just prior to publication. The book, The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America\\'s War in Afghanistan, provided a much more expansive look at McChrystal and the culture of senior American military and how they become embroiled in such wars. The book reached Amazon\\'s bestseller list in the first 48 hours of release, and it received generally favorable reviews. Salon\\'s Glenn Greenwald described it as \"superb,\" \"brave\" and \"eye-opening\".In 2012, Taibbi, through his coverage of the Libor scandal, emerged as an expert on that topic, which led to media appearances outside Rolling Stone.On November 9, 2012, the magazine published its first Spanish-language section on Latino music and culture, in the issue dated November 22.\\n\\n2016 to present: New ownership\\nIn September 2016, Advertising Age reported that Wenner was in the process of selling a 49% stake of the magazine to a company from Singapore called BandLab Technologies. The new investor had no direct involvement in the editorial content of the magazine.In September 2017, Wenner Media announced that the remaining 51% of Rolling Stone magazine was up for sale. In December 2017, Penske Media acquired the remaining stake from Wenner Media. It became a monthly magazine from the July 2018 issue. On January 31, 2019, Penske acquired BandLab\\'s 49% stake in Rolling Stone, gaining full ownership of the magazine.\\n\\nCovers\\nSome artists have been featured on the cover many times, and some of these pictures went on to become iconic. The Beatles, for example, have appeared on the cover more than 30 times, either individually or as a band. The magazine is known for provocative photography and has featured musicians and celebrities on the cover throughout its history. Vanity Fair called the January 22, 1981, cover featuring John Lennon and Yoko Ono the \"Greatest Rolling Stone Cover Ever\".The first ten issues featured, in order of appearance, the following:\\n\\nJohn Lennon\\nTina Turner\\nThe Beatles\\nJimi Hendrix, Donovan & Otis Redding\\nJim Morrison\\nJanis Joplin\\nJimi Hendrix\\nMonterey Pop Festival\\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney\\nEric Clapton\\n\\nPrint format\\nThe printed format has gone through several changes. The first publications, in 1967–72, were in folded tabloid newspaper format, with no staples, black ink text, and a single color highlight that changed each edition. From 1973 onwards, editions were produced on a four-color press with a different newsprint paper size. In 1979, the bar code appeared. In 1980, it became a gloss-paper, large format (10\"×12\") magazine. Editions switched to the standard 8\"×11\" magazine size starting with the issue dated October 30, 2008. Starting with the new monthly July 2018 issue, it returned to the previous 10\"×12\" large format.\\n\\nWebsite\\nRolling Stone\\'s maintains a website where it shares similar content to its print publication.The site at one time had an extensive message-board forum. By the late 1990s, this had developed into a thriving community, with many regular members and contributors worldwide. However, the site was also plagued with numerous Internet trolls and malicious code-hackers, who vandalized the forum substantially. The magazine abruptly deleted the forum in May 2004, then began a new, much more limited message board community on their site in late 2005, only to remove it again in 2006. In March 2008, the website started a new message board section once again, then deleted it in April 2010.\\nRolling Stone devotes one of its table of contents pages to promoting material currently appearing on its website, listing detailed links to the items.\\nOn April 19, 2010, the website underwent a redesign and began featuring the complete archives of Rolling Stone. The archive was first launched under a for-pay model, but has since transitioned to a free-with-print-subscription model. In the spring of 2012, Rolling Stone launched a federated search feature which searches both the website and the archive.The website has become an interactive source of biographical information on music artists in addition to historical rankings from the magazine. Users can cross-reference lists and they are also provided with historical insights.  For example, one group that is listed on both Rolling Stone\\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and Rolling Stone\\'s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time is Toots and the Maytals, with biographical details from Rolling Stone that explain how Toots and the Maytals are responsible for coining the term \"reggae\" in their song \"Do the Reggay\". For biographical information on all artists, the website contains a directory listed alphabetically.\\n\\nGlixel\\nIn May 2016, Wenner Media announced plans to create a separate online publication dedicated to the coverage of video games and video game culture. Gus Wenner, Jann Wenner\\'s son and head of digital for the publication at the time, told The New York Times that \"gaming is today what rock \\'n\\' roll was when Rolling Stone was founded\". Glixel was originally hosted on Rolling Stone\\'s website and transitioned to its own domain by October 2016. Stories from Glixel are included on the Rolling Stone website, while writers for Rolling Stone were also able to contribute to Glixel. The site was headed by John Davison, and its offices were located in San Francisco. Rolling Stone closed down the offices in June 2017 and fired the entire staff, citing the difficulties of working with the remote site from their main New York office. Brian Crecente, founder of Kotaku and co-founder of bigger Polygon, was hired as editorial director and runs the site from the main New York office. Following the sale of Rolling Stone\\'s assets to Penske Media Corporation, the Glixel content was merged into the routine publishing of Variety, with Crecente remaining as editorial director.\\n\\nRestaurant\\nIn December 2009, the Los Angeles Times reported that the owners of Rolling Stone magazine planned to open a Rolling Stone restaurant in the Hollywood & Highland Center in Hollywood in the spring of 2010. The expectation was that the restaurant could become the first of a national chain if it was successful. As of November 2010, the \"soft opening\" of the restaurant was planned for December 2010. In 2011, the restaurant was open for lunch and dinner as well as a full night club downstairs on the weekends. The restaurant closed in February 2013.\\n\\nCriticism\\nOne major criticism of Rolling Stone involves its generational bias toward the 1960s and 1970s. One critic referred to the Rolling Stone list of the \"500 Greatest Songs\" as an example of \"unrepentant rockist fogeyism\". In further response to this issue, rock critic Jim DeRogatis, a former Rolling Stone editor, published a thorough critique of the magazine\\'s lists in a book called Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics, which featured differing opinions from many younger critics.Rolling Stone magazine has been criticized for reconsidering many classic albums that it had previously dismissed, and for frequent use of the 3.5-star rating. For example, Led Zeppelin was largely written off by Rolling Stone magazine critics during the band\\'s most active years in the 1970s, but by 2006, a cover story on the band honored them as \"the Heaviest Band of All Time\". A critic for Slate magazine described a conference at which 1984\\'s The Rolling Stone Record Guide was scrutinized. As he described it, \"The guide virtually ignored hip-hop and ruthlessly panned heavy metal, the two genres that within a few years would dominate the pop charts. In an auditorium packed with music journalists, you could detect more than a few anxious titters: How many of us will want our record reviews read back to us 20 years hence?\"The hiring of former FHM editor Ed Needham further enraged critics who alleged that Rolling Stone had lost its credibility.The 2003 \"Rolling Stone\\'s 100 Greatest Guitarists of all Time\" article, which named only two female musicians, resulted in Venus Zine answering with their own list, entitled \"The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time\".Conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg stated that Rolling Stone had \"essentially become the house organ of the Democratic National Committee\". Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner has made all of his political donations to Democrats. Rolling Stone endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Rolling Stone\\'s film critic, Peter Travers, has been criticized for his high number of repetitively used blurbs.\\n\\nTsarnaev cover\\nThe August 2013 Rolling Stone cover, featuring then-accused (later convicted) Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, drew widespread criticism that the magazine was \"glamorizing terrorism\" and that the cover was a \"slap in the face to the great city of Boston\". The online edition of the article was accompanied by a short editorial stating that the story \"falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone\\'s long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day\". The controversial cover photograph that was used by Rolling Stone had previously featured on the front page of The New York Times on May 5, 2013.In response to the outcry, New England-based CVS Pharmacy and Tedeschi Food Shops banned their stores from carrying the issue. Also refusing to sell the issue were \\nWalgreens;Rite-Aid and Kmart; Roche Bros. and Stop & Shop;H-E-B and Walmart;7-Eleven;Hy-Vee, Rutter\\'s Farm, and United Supermarkets;Cumberland Farms and Market Basket; \\nand Shaw\\'s.\\nBoston mayor Thomas Menino sent a letter to Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner, calling the cover \"ill-conceived, at best ... [it] reaffirms a message that destruction gains fame for killers and their \\'causes\\'.\"  Menino also wrote, \"To respond to you in anger is to feed into your obvious market strategy\", and that Wenner could have written about the survivors or the people who came to help after the bombings instead. In conclusion he wrote, \"The survivors of the Boston Marathon deserve Rolling Stone cover stories, though I no longer feel that Rolling Stone deserves them.\"\\n\\nUVA false rape story\\nIn the issue dated November 19, 2014, the story \"A Rape on Campus\" was run about an alleged gang rape on the campus of the University of Virginia. Separate inquiries by Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity accused by Rolling Stone of facilitating the alleged rape, and The Washington Post revealed major errors, omissions and discrepancies in the story. Reporter Sabrina Erdely\\'s story was subject to intense media criticism. The Washington Post and Boston Herald issued calls for magazine staff involved in the report to be fired. Rolling Stone subsequently issued three apologies for the story. Some suggested that legal action against the magazine by persons accused of the rape might result.On December 5, 2014, Rolling Stone\\'s managing editor, Will Dana, apologized for not fact-checking the story.  Rolling Stone commissioned an outside investigation of the story and its problems by the dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. The report uncovered journalistic failure in the UVA story and institutional problems with reporting at Rolling Stone. Rolling Stone retracted the story on April 5, 2015. On April 6, 2015, following the investigation and retraction of the story, Phi Kappa Psi announced plans to pursue all available legal action against Rolling Stone, including claims of defamation.On May 12, 2015, UVA associate dean Nicole Eramo, chief administrator for handling sexual assault issues at the school, filed a $7.5 million defamation lawsuit in Charlottesville Circuit Court against Rolling Stone and Erdely, claiming damage to her reputation and emotional distress.  Said the filing, \"Rolling Stone and Erdely\\'s highly defamatory and false statements about Dean Eramo were not the result of an innocent mistake.  They were the result of a wanton journalist who was more concerned with writing an article that fulfilled her preconceived narrative about the victimization of women on American college campuses, and a malicious publisher who was more concerned about selling magazines to boost the economic bottom line for its faltering magazine, than they were about discovering the truth or actual facts.\" On November 4, 2016, after 20 hours of deliberation, a jury consisting of eight women and two men found Rolling Stone, the magazine\\'s publisher and Erdely liable for defaming Eramo.On July 29, 2015, three graduates of the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi filed a lawsuit against Rolling Stone, its publisher Wenner Media, and a journalist for defamation and infliction of emotional distress. The same day, and just months after the controversy began, The New York Times reported that managing editor Will Dana was departing the magazine with his last date recorded as August 7, 2015. On November 9, 2015, the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity filed suit for $25 million for damages to its reputation caused by the magazine\\'s publication of this story, \"with reckless disregard for the truth\".\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nGeorge Harrison\\'s song \"This Guitar\" (1975), a lyrical sequel to his Beatles track \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" (1968), references the magazine in its second verse: \"Learned to get up when I fall / Can even climb Rolling Stone walls\". The song was written in response to some highly unfavorable reviews from Rolling Stone and other publications for Harrison\\'s 1974 North American tour and the Dark Horse album.The 2000 film Almost Famous centers on a teenage journalist writing for the magazine in the early 1970s while covering the fictional band Stillwater. The film was directed by Cameron Crowe and based on his own experiences as a young journalist for the magazine in the same time period.\"The Cover of Rolling Stone\" is a song written by Shel Silverstein and first recorded by American rock group Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show. The song satirizes success in the music business; the song\\'s narrator laments that his band, despite having the superficial attributes of a successful rock star (including drug usage, \"teenage groupies, who\\'ll do anything we say\", and a frenetic guitar solo), has been unable to \"get their pictures on the cover of the Rolling Stone\".The title track of Pink Floyd\\'s album, The Final Cut, features the line, \"Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?\"\\nIn Stephen King\\'s novel, Firestarter, the protagonists decide to tell their story to Rolling Stone.\\n\\nInternational editions\\nPublisher Steve DeLuca said the international editions typically include 50 to 80 percent of the American version of the magazine, translated in their own languages, and supplemented with local content.\\nArgentina – Published by La Nación since April 1998. This edition also circulates in Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay.

              " 'Ron Kovic': 'Ronald Lawrence Kovic (born July 4, 1946) is an American anti-war activist, writer, and former United States Marine Corps sergeant, who was wounded and paralyzed in the Vietnam War. His best selling 1976 memoir Born on the Fourth of July was made into the Academy Award–winning 1989 film directed by Oliver Stone.Kovic received the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay on January 20, 1990, 22 years to the day that he was wounded in Vietnam, and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category.\\n\\nEarly life\\nKovic was born in Ladysmith, Wisconsin, the second eldest of the six children  of Patricia Lamb and Eli Kovic. He was raised in Massapequa, New York, in a Catholic household. His family was of Croatian descent and his father served honorably in the United States Navy during World War II.  He met Lamb during the Second World War when she was serving in the United States Navy to which she enlisted not long after Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941.  She was of Irish ancestry, and a housewife. After the war, Eli Kovic and his family moved to Massapequa, New York, where he worked as a grocery clerk in an A&P food store. In high school, Ron Kovic was a wrestler and pole vaulter, and hoped to be a Major League Baseball player after graduation.His father Eli was born with the last name Kovacevic in Chisholm, Minnesota to a Croatian immigrant mother Anna Delivuk.\\n\\nU.S. Marine Corps\\nInspired by President John F. Kennedy\\'s \"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country\" inaugural address in January 1961 and after Kennedy\\'s death in November 1963, Kovic joined the United States Marine Corps after high school in September 1964. He was sent to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina, where, after twelve weeks of intensive recruit training, he was promoted to the rank of Private First Class and became the push-up champion of his battalion. Kovic was then sent to the Infantry Training Regiment (ITR) at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, for advanced combat training. He returned home to Massapequa in December, just before Christmas. After several weeks\\' leave, Kovic was assigned to the Marine Corps Barracks at Norfolk, Virginia, where he attended radio school and learned communication skills, including Morse code. He was then assigned to the Second Field Artillery Battalion, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.\\n\\nMilitary service in Vietnam\\nKovic volunteered to serve in Vietnam, and was sent to South Vietnam in December 1965 as a member of H&S Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division. In June 1966, he was transferred to Bravo Company, Second Platoon, 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division where he participated in 22 Long Range Reconnaissance Patrols in enemy territory and was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal with Combat V for valor. After a 13-month tour of duty, he returned home on January 15, 1967. He was subsequently assigned to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing at Cherry Point, North Carolina. Several months later, he volunteered to return to Vietnam for a second tour of duty.He was assigned to H&S Company, 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion, 3rd Marine Division in South Vietnam. In October 1967, according to Kovic, he accidentally shot and killed another Marine during an NVA (North Vietnamese Army) ambush near a village along the Cửa Việt River.\\nOn January 20, 1968, while leading a reconnaissance force of battalion scouts from the 1st Amtrac Battalion just north of the Cửa Việt River in the vicinity of the village of Mỹ Lộc, in the Demilitarized Zone, Kovic\\'s squad came into contact with the NVA 803rd Regiment and elements of a Viet Cong battalion that was besieging the village; he was shot by NVA soldiers while leading his rifle squad across an open area, attempting to aid the South Vietnamese Popular Force unit in the village. Deserted by most of his unit, he was shot first in the right foot, which tore out the back of his heel, then again through the right shoulder, suffering a collapsed lung and a spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down. The first Marine that tried to save him was shot through the heart and killed, before a second Marine carried Kovic to safety through heavy enemy fire. Kovic then spent a week in an intensive care ward in Da Nang. As a result of his service and injuries in the conflict, Kovic was awarded the Bronze Star with Combat \"V\" for heroism in battle and the Purple Heart.\\n\\nPost-Vietnam activism\\nBefore the end of the war in Vietnam was declared on April 30, 1975, Kovic became one of the best-known peace activists among the Vietnam veterans, and was arrested 12 times for political protesting. He attended his first peace demonstration soon after the Kent State shootings in May 1970, and gave his first speech against the war at Levittown Memorial High School in Levittown, Long Island, New York that same spring. Kovic\\'s speech that day was interrupted by a bomb threat and the auditorium was cleared.Undeterred, Kovic continued speaking to students from the school\\'s football grandstands. His first arrest was during an anti-Vietnam War demonstration at an Orange County, California draft board in the spring of 1971 when he refused to leave the office of the draft board explaining to a representative that, by sending young men to Vietnam, they were inadvertently \"condemning them to their death,\" or to be wounded and maimed like himself in a war that he had come to believe was, \"immoral and made no sense.\" He was told that, if he did not leave the draft board immediately, he would be arrested. Kovic refused to leave, and was taken away by police.In 1974, Kovic led a group of disabled Vietnam War veterans in wheelchairs on a 17-day hunger strike inside the Los Angeles office of Senator Alan Cranston. The veterans protested the \"poor treatment in America\\'s Veterans Hospitals\" and demanded better treatment for returning veterans, a full investigation of all Veterans Administration (VA) facilities, and a face-to-face meeting with head of the VA, Donald E. Johnson. The strike continued to escalate until Johnson finally agreed to fly out from Washington, D.C., and meet with the veterans. The hunger strike ended soon after that. Several months later Johnson resigned. In late August 1974, Kovic traveled to Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he spent a week in the Catholic stronghold of \"Turf Lodge,\" interviewing both political activists and residents. In the spring of 1975 Kovic, author Richard Boyle, and photo journalist Loretta Smith traveled to cover the war in Cambodia for Pacific News Service.Kovic was a speaker at the 1976 Democratic National Convention, seconding the nomination of draft resister Fritz Efaw for Vice President of the United States. Time magazine described the scene as one of the few poignant moments of the convention and many in the audience were brought to tears. On July 12, 1977, Kovic was arrested with 191 students and supporters during the anti-Gymnasium protests at Kent State University. In 1979, Ron Kovic gave a speech at The Libertarian National Convention which nominated Ed Clark for President. In 1988, Kovic was a Jesse Jackson delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1983, he published Around the World in Eight Days, a short novel about a Vietnam War veteran who wagers that he can circle the globe in eight days without the benefit of aircraft. Writing in American Book Review, Edmund Cardoni called the book \"wildly imaginative\" and noted that compared to Born on the Fourth of July, Around the World in Eight Days is \"more patently literary in the tribute it pays to the transformative power of narrative art.\"\\nFrom 1990 to 1991, Kovic took part in several anti-war demonstrations against the first Gulf War, which occurred not long after the release of his biographical film in 1989. In early May 1999, following the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Kovic met with China\\'s ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing at the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. to express his condolences and present the ambassador and his staff with two dozen red roses. He was an outspoken critic of the Iraq War.\\n\\nSince 2000\\nIn November 2003, Kovic joined protests in London against the visit of George W. Bush. He was the guest of honor at a reception held at London\\'s city hall by Mayor Ken Livingstone. The following day, he led a march of several hundred thousand demonstrators on Trafalgar Square, where a huge rally was held protesting the visit of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. Kovic attended the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. On Sunday, August 24, 2008, the day before the convention began, Kovic spoke, then led thousands in a march against the war which ended with him saying, \"In the city of Denver, we got welcomed home.\"In a new introduction to his book, Born on the Fourth of July (1976), written in March 2005, Kovic stated, \"I wanted people to understand. I wanted to share with them as nakedly and openly and intimately as possible what I had gone through, what I had endured. I wanted them to know what it really meant to be in a war, to be shot and wounded, to be fighting for my life on the intensive care ward, not the myth we had grown up believing. I wanted people to know about the hospitals and the enema room, about why I had become opposed to the war, why I had grown more and more committed to peace and nonviolence. I had been beaten by the police and arrested twelve times for protesting the war and I had spent many nights in jail in my wheelchair. I had been called a Communist and a traitor, simply for trying to tell the truth about what had happened in that war, but I refused to be intimidated.\" In 1989, on the last day of filming Born On The Fourth of July, Kovic presented actor Tom Cruise, who portrayed him in the movie, the original Bronze Star he had received, explaining to Cruise that he was giving him the medal as a gift  \"for his heroic performance.\" Time magazine reported that Oliver Stone said, \"He gave it to Tom for bravery for having gone through this experience in hell as much as any person can without actually having been there.\"\\nIn March 2007, Kovic checked into the Ernest Bors Spinal Cord Injury ward of the Veterans Administration Hospital in Long Beach, California, for an undisclosed illness.\\nOn January 20, 2008, Kovic observed the 40th anniversary of his having been shot and paralyzed in the Vietnam War. Kovic, in March 2005, said: \"The scar will always be there, a living reminder of that war, but it has also become something beautiful now, something of faith and hope and love. I have been given the opportunity to move through that dark night of the soul to a new shore, to gain an understanding, a knowledge, and entirely different vision. I now believe I have suffered for a reason and in many ways I have found that reason in my commitment to peace and nonviolence. My life has been a blessing in disguise, even with the pain and great difficulty that my physical disability continues to bring. It is a blessing to speak on behalf of peace, to be able to reach such a great number of people.\"\\nOn April 8, 2009, Kovic joined British MP George Galloway to launch Viva Palestina USA, an American branch of Viva Palestina. Kovic planned to co-lead with Galloway a humanitarian relief convoy to the Gaza Strip in early July 2009. On December 6, 2009 Kovic spoke honoring Bruce Springsteen at the 32nd annual Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, D.C. On December 22, 2009, Kovic, Oliver Stone, and friends celebrated the 20th anniversary of the filming of Born on the Fourth of July at a dinner party in Torrance, California. In April 2010, Kovic traveled to Rome, Italy, as a member of the Council for Dignity, Forgiveness, and Reconciliation. Between April 19–26, he attended meetings at Rome\\'s City Hall with other international peace activists, diplomats and academics, to discuss the need for conflict resolution and other more peaceful, nonviolent alternatives to war as a way of solving the world\\'s many conflicts. On April 21, 2010, he spoke of his journey from war to peace, forgiveness, and reconciliation before Rome\\'s mayor, Gianni Alemanno, and other civic leaders at Rome\\'s Ara Pacis (Altar of Augustan Peace).\\nOn July 4, 2016 Akashic Books published the 40th anniversary edition of Born on the Fourth of July, with a foreword by Bruce Springsteen, in conjunction with Kovic\\'s latest book, Hurricane Street. Naming it a Top 10 Pick for Spring 2016, Publishers Weekly reported that Kovic \"writes an impassioned and timely memoir about the 1974 American Veterans Movement that will strike a chord with veterans and their families today.\"\\nDespite its creator\\'s fatalism, Born On the Fourth of July has left ripples. Stone expressed great admiration for Kovic, praising him for effecting change in America\\'s VA hospitals, and actively protesting both Gulf Wars. \"He\\'s one of the strongest men I\\'ve ever met in my life,\" Stone said. \"I don\\'t know how he\\'s able to go through what he does every day.\" Born on the Fourth of July received a National Book Award nomination. Professor of Literature Purchase College, SUNY Elise Lemire has stated that Kovics book Born on the Fourth of July, \"stands alongside Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms as our country\\'s two greatest works of antiwar literature.\"\\nKovic lives in Redondo Beach, California, where he writes, paints, plays the piano, and gardens. He has never married, although he did have a relationship with Connie Panzarino (author of The Me in the Mirror).\\n\\nLegacy\\nBruce Springsteen wrote the song \"Shut Out the Light\" after reading Kovic\\'s memoir and then meeting him. Tom Paxton, the folk singer/political activist, wrote the song \"Born on the Fourth of July\", which is on his 1977 New Songs from the Briarpatch album, and met Kovic backstage at the Bottom Line Club in New York City the same year.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nKovic is the uncle of internet personality Adam Kovic.\\n\\nFilms\\n1973 – Operation Last Patrol.

              " 'San Francisco Chronicle': 'The San Francisco Chronicle is a newspaper serving primarily the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California. It was founded in 1865 as The Daily Dramatic Chronicle by teenage brothers Charles de Young and Michael H. de Young. The paper is owned by the Hearst Corporation, which bought it from the de Young family in 2000. It is the only major daily paper covering the city and county of San Francisco.\\nThe paper benefited from the growth of San Francisco and had the largest newspaper circulation on the West Coast of the United States by 1880. Like other newspapers, it has experienced a rapid fall in circulation in the early 21st century and was ranked 24th by circulation nationally for the six months to March 2010.\\nIn 1994, the newspaper launched the SFGATE website, including both content from the paper and other sources. In 2013, the newspaper launched its own namesake website, SFChronicle.com, and began the separation of the SFGATE and Chronicle brands, which today are two separately run entities.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe Chronicle was founded by brothers Charles and M. H. de Young in 1865 as The Daily Dramatic Chronicle, funded by a borrowed $20 gold piece. Their brother Gustavus was named with Charles on the masthead. Within 10 years, it had the largest circulation of any newspaper west of the Mississippi River. The paper\\'s first office was in a building at the corner of Bush and Kearney Streets. The brothers then commissioned a building from Burnham and Root at 690 Market Street at the corner of Third and Kearney Streets to be their new headquarters, in what became known as Newspaper Row. The new building, San Francisco\\'s first skyscraper, was completed in 1889.  It was damaged in the 1906 earthquake, but it was rebuilt under the direction of William Polk, Burnham\\'s associate in San Francisco. That building, known as the \"Old Chronicle Building\" or the \"DeYoung Building\", still stands and was restored in 2007. It is a historic landmark and is the location of the Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences.In 1924, the Chronicle commissioned a new headquarters at 901 Mission Street on the corner of 5th Street in what is now the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood of San Francisco. It was designed by Charles Peter Weeks and William Peyton Day in the Gothic Revival architecture style, but most of the Gothic Revival detailing was removed in 1968 when the building was re-clad with stucco. This building remains the Chronicle\\'s headquarters in 2017, although other concerns are located there as well.Between World War II and 1971, new editor Scott Newhall took a bold and somewhat provocative approach to news presentation. Newhall\\'s Chronicle included investigative reporting by such journalists as Pierre Salinger, who later played a prominent role in national politics, and Paul Avery, the staffer who pursued the trail of the self-named \"Zodiac Killer\", who sent a cryptogram in three sections in letters to the Chronicle and two other papers during his murder spree in the late 1960s. It also featured such colorful columnists as Pauline Phillips, who wrote under the name \"Dear Abby,\" \"Count Marco\" (Marc Spinelli), Stanton Delaplane, Terence O\\'Flaherty, Lucius Beebe, Art Hoppe,  Charles McCabe, and Herb Caen.\\nThe newspaper grew in circulation to become the city\\'s largest, overtaking the rival San Francisco Examiner. The demise of other San Francisco dailies through the late 1950s and early 1960s left the Examiner and the Chronicle to battle for circulation and readership superiority.\\n\\nJoint operating agreement\\nThe competition between the Chronicle and Examiner took a financial toll on both papers until the summer of 1965, when a merger of sorts created a joint operating agreement under which the Chronicle became the city\\'s sole morning daily while the Examiner changed to afternoon publication (which ultimately led to a declining readership).\\nThe newspapers were officially owned by the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which managed sales and distribution for both newspapers and was charged with ensuring that one newspaper\\'s circulation did not grow at the expense of the other. Revenue was split equally, which led to a situation widely understood to benefit the Examiner, since the Chronicle, which had a circulation four times larger than its rival, subsidized the afternoon newspaper.The two newspapers produced a joint Sunday edition, with the Examiner publishing the news sections and the Sunday magazine, and the Chronicle responsible for the tabloid-sized entertainment section and the book review. From 1965 on the two papers shared a single classified-advertising operation. This arrangement stayed in place until the Hearst Corporation took full control of the Chronicle in 2000.\\n\\nPush into the suburbs\\nBeginning in the early 1990s, the Chronicle began to face competition beyond the borders of San Francisco. The newspaper had long enjoyed a wide reach as the de facto \"newspaper of record\" in Northern California, with distribution along the Central Coast, the Inland Empire, and even as far as Honolulu, Hawaii. There was little competition in the Bay Area suburbs and other areas that the newspaper served, but as Knight-Ridder consolidated the San Jose Mercury News in 1975; purchased the Contra Costa Times (now East Bay Times) in 1995; and as the Denver-based Media News Group made a rapid purchase of the remaining newspapers on the East Bay by 1985, the Chronicle realized it had to step up its suburban coverage.\\nThe Chronicle launched five zoned sections to appear in the Friday edition of the paper. The sections covered San Francisco and four different suburban areas. They each featured a unique columnist, enterprise pieces, and local news specific to the community. The newspaper added 40 full-time staff positions to work in the suburban bureaus. Despite the push to focus on suburban coverage, the Chronicle was hamstrung by the Sunday edition, which, being produced by the San Francisco-centric \"un-Chronicle\" Examiner, had none of the focus on the suburban communities that the Chronicle was striving to cultivate.\\n\\nSale to Hearst\\nThe de Young family controlled the paper, via the Chronicle Publishing Company, until July 27, 2000, when it was sold to Hearst Communications, Inc., which owned the Examiner. Following the sale, the Hearst Corporation transferred the Examiner to the Fang family, publisher of the San Francisco Independent and AsianWeek, along with a $66-million subsidy. Under the new owners, the Examiner became a free tabloid, leaving the Chronicle as the only daily broadsheet newspaper in San Francisco.\\nIn 1949, the de Young family founded KRON-TV (Channel 4), the Bay Area\\'s third television station. Until the mid-1960s, the station (along with KRON-FM), operated from the basement of the Chronicle Building, on Mission Street. KRON moved to studios at 1001 Van Ness Avenue (on the former site of St. Mary\\'s Cathedral, which burned down in 1962). KRON was sold to Young Broadcasting in 2000 and, after years of being San Francisco\\'s NBC affiliate, became an independent station on January 1, 2002, when NBC—tired of Chronicle\\'s repeated refusal to sell KRON to the network and, later, Young\\'s asking price for the station being too high—purchased KNTV in San Jose from Granite Broadcasting Corporation for $230 million.\\n\\nSince the Hearst Corporation took ownership in 2000 the Chronicle has made periodic changes to its organization and design, but on February 1, 2009, as the newspaper began its 145th year of publication, the Chronicle Sunday edition introduced a redesigned paper featuring a modified logo, new section, and page organization, new features, bolder, colored section-front banners and new headline and text typography. The frequent bold-faced, all-capital-letter headlines typical of the Chronicle\\'s front page were eliminated. Editor Ward Bushee\\'s note heralded the issue as the start of a \"new era\" for the Chronicle.\\nOn July 6, 2009, the paper unveiled some alterations to the new design that included yet newer section fronts and wider use of color photographs and graphics. In a special section publisher, Frank J. Vega described new, state-of-the-art printing operations enabling the production of what he termed \"A Bolder, Brighter Chronicle.\"  The newer look was accompanied by a reduction in size of the broadsheet. Such moves are similar to those made by other prominent American newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and Orlando Sentinel, which in 2008 unveiled radically new designs even as changing reader demographics and general economic conditions necessitated physical reductions of the newspapers.\\n\\nOn November 9, 2009, the Chronicle became the first newspaper in the nation to print on high-quality glossy paper. The high-gloss paper is used for some section fronts and inside pages.\\n\\nStaff\\nThe current publisher of the Chronicle is Bill Nagel.  Audrey Cooper was named editor-in-chief in January 2015 and was the first woman to hold the position. In June 2020 she left to be the editor-in-chief of WNYC, New York City. In August 2020, Hearst named Emilio Garcia-Ruiz the publication’s editor in chief. Ann Killion  has written for Sports Illustrated. Carl Nolte is a journalist and columnist. Tom Stienstra is a columnist.\\n\\nWeb\\nThe online versions of the newspaper are at SFGate.com (free) and SFChronicle.com (premium). As well as publishing the San Francisco Chronicle online, SFGate and SFChronicle.com add other features not available in the print version, such as blogs and podcasts. SFGate was one of the earliest major market newspaper websites to be launched, having done so in 1994, at the time of The Newspaper Guild strike; meanwhile the union published its own news website, San Francisco Free Press. Cross its \"ecosystem of solutions\" (San Francisco Chronicle, SFGate, SFChronicle.com, 46Mil,dms, core {} audience, The Story Studio, and Vision SF)  it has over 33 million unique visitors each month (of these SFGATE - SFDMA accounts for 59.6 Million Pageviews, 3.0 Million Unique Visitors; SFGATE - GLOBAL accounts for 136.1 Million Pageviews, 27.2 Million Unique Visitors; SFCHRONICLE - SFDMA accounts for 6.5 Million Pageviews, 1.6 Million Unique Visitors; SFCHRONICLE - GLOBAL accounts for 14.9 Million Pageviews, 5.4 Million Unique Visitors). SFGate has a weekly unduplicated audience of 983,798 and sfchronicle.com has a weekly unduplicated audience of 306,535.\\n\\nPraise, criticism, and features\\nThe paper has received the Pulitzer Prize on a number of occasions. Despite an illustrious and long history, the paper\\'s news reportage is not as extensive as in the past. The current day Chronicle has followed the trend of other American newspapers, devoting increasing attention to local and regional news and cultural and entertainment criticism to the detriment of the paper\\'s traditionally strong national and international reporting, though the paper does maintain a Washington, D.C., bureau. This increased focus on local news is a response to the competition from other Bay Area newspapers including the resurrected San Francisco Examiner, the Oakland Tribune, the East Bay Times (formerly Contra Costa Times and the San Jose Mercury News.\\nLance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada received the 2004 George Polk Award for Sports Reporting.  Fainaru-Wada and Williams were recognized for their work on uncovering the BALCO scandal, which linked San Francisco Giants star Barry Bonds to performance-enhancing drugs. While the two above-named reporters broke the news, they are by no means the only sports writers of note at the Chronicle. The Chronicle\\'s sports section, edited by Al Saracevic and called Sporting Green as it is printed on green-tinted pages, is staffed by a dozen writers. The section\\'s best-known writers are its columnists: Bruce Jenkins, Ann Killion, Scott Ostler, Saracevic and Tom Stienstra. Its baseball coverage is anchored by Henry Schulman, John Shea, and Susan Slusser, the first female president of the Baseball Writers\\' Association of America (BBWAA).\\nThe Chronicle\\'s Sunday arts and entertainment insert section is called Datebook, and has for decades been printed on pink-tinted paper in a tabloid format. Movie reviews (for many years written by nationally known critic Mick LaSalle) feature a unique rating system: instead of stars or a \"thumbs up\" system, the Chronicle has for decades used a small cartoon icon, sitting in a movie theater seat, known as the \"Little Man,\" explained in 2008 by the Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert: \"...the only rating system that makes any sense is the Little Man of the San Francisco Chronicle, who is seen (1) jumping out of his seat and applauding wildly; (2) sitting up happily and applauding; (3) sitting attentively; (4) asleep in his seat; or (5) gone from his seat.\"Another area of note is the architecture column by John King; the Chronicle is still one of the few American papers to present a regular column on architectural issues. The paper also has regular weekly sections devoted to Food & Home and Style.\\n\\nChallenges\\nCirculation has fallen sharply since the dot-com boom peaked from around 1997 to 2001. The Chronicle\\'s daily readership dropped by 16.6% between 2004 and 2005 to 400,906; The Chronicle fired one quarter of its newsroom staff in a cost-cutting move in May 2007. Newspaper executives pointed to growth of SFGate, the online website with 5.2 million unique visitors per month - fifth among U.S. newspaper websites in 2007.\\nIn February 2009, Hearst chief executive Frank A. Bennack Jr., and Hearst President Steven R. Swartz, announced that the Chronicle had lost money every year since 2001 and more than $50 million in 2008. Without major concessions from employees and other cuts, Hearst would put the papers up for sale and if no buyer was found, shut the paper. San Francisco would have become the first major American city without a daily newspaper. The cuts were made.\\nIn spite of – or perhaps because of – the threats, the loss of readers and advertisers accelerated. On October 26, 2009, the Audit Bureau of Circulations reported that the Chronicle had suffered a 25.8% drop in circulation for the six-month period ending September 2009, to 251,782 subscribers, the largest percentage drop in circulation of any major newspaper in the United States. Chronicle publisher Frank Vega said the drop was expected as the paper moved to earn more from higher subscription fees from fewer readers. In May 2013, Vega retired and was replaced as publisher by former Los Angeles Times publisher Jeffrey M. Johnson. SFGate, the main digital portal for the San Francisco Chronicle, registered 19 million unique visitors in January 2015, making it the seventh-ranked newspaper website in the United States.\\n\\nPublishers\\nM.

The Saturn Awards were devised by Dr. Donald A. Reed, who felt that films within those genres were never given the appreciation they deserved. The physical award is a representation of the planet Saturn, surrounded with a ring of film. The award was initially and is still sometimes loosely referred to as a Golden Scroll. The award for Best Actor was first introduced in 1976 for the 1974 and 1975 years, to reward a lead performance by a male actor in film.\\nThe record for most awards is held by Robert Downey, Jr. with four wins, followed by and Mark Hamill with three, with Jeff Bridges and Harrison Ford with two each. Tom Cruise is the most nominated actor in the category with eleven nominations, followed by Downey, Jr. and Arnold Schwarzenegger with seven. Arnold Schwarzenegger holds the record for most nominations without a victory.  Anthony Hopkins and Martin Landau are the only actors to have won the Saturn Award for Best Actor and an Academy Award for the same role; however, Landau won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and not Best Actor.

Although a commercial failure, Shattered Glass received acclaim from critics, with particular praise for Christensen\\'s and Sarsgaard\\'s performances.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 1998, Stephen Glass is an associate editor at The New Republic. Among the youngest of the magazine\\'s staff, Glass enjoys popularity with his colleagues for his entertaining stories. Glass serves under editor Michael Kelly, whom the writers hold loyalty towards. However, conflict between Kelly and publisher Marty Peretz results in Peretz firing Kelly. Reporter Charles Lane is promoted by Peretz to replace Kelly despite being disliked by the staff.\\nGlass writes a story entitled \"Hack Heaven\" that details a teenage hacker being hired by a large software firm he infiltrated. The story reaches Forbes Digital Tool where reporter Adam Penenberg finds no corroborating evidence for what Glass described. When contacted by Penenberg about being unable to reach the individuals in his story, Glass provides a number with a Palo Alto area code for the firm. After Lane calls the number, he briefly speaks with an individual identifying as the firm\\'s chairman. Glass and Lane also partake in a conference call with the Forbes staff which further erodes the story\\'s credibility and prompts Glass to claim he was tricked by his sources.\\nLane, looking to protect Glass from the Forbes staff, has Glass take him to a convention center and restaurant where the story took place, but learns that both were closed during the events Glass wrote about. With the story contradicted by this information, Glass tells Lane he had only relied on sources for information and falsified his first-hand experiences to improve the story. Lane decides to suspend Glass instead of firing him due to his popularity, but upon discovering that Glass\\' brother lives in Palo Alto, he realizes that Glass had his brother pose as the firm\\'s chairman. After confronting Glass with this knowledge, Lane re-reads Glass\\' previous stories and comes to the revelation that they were also falsified. With his deception exposed, Glass is fired by Lane.\\nDespite initial pushback, Lane receives support from The New Republic staff for bringing Glass\\' deception to light, while the magazine\\'s attorney questions Glass over which stories of his were fabricated. Closing titles reveal that Penenberg\\'s article on Glass was hailed as a breakthrough for internet journalism, The New Republic determined that 27 of Glass\\' 41 stories were either partially or completely fabricated, Kelly was killed while covering the Iraq War, Glass earned a Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown and wrote a novel paralleling his own life, and Lane joined The Washington Post.\\n\\nCast\\nAdditionally, Louis Philippe Dandenault, Morgan Kelly, Christian Tessier, James Berlingieri, and Brett Watson appear as the Young Republicans described in one of Glass\\' stories. In Glass\\' depiction of \"Hack Heaven\", Owen Roth plays Ian Restil, Bill Rowat plays George Sims, Michele Scarabelli plays Ian\\'s mother, and Terry Simpson plays Joe Hiert. Alec Shumpert, a fictional associate editor at George, is played by Andrew Airlie. Mark Camacho appears as Glass\\' attorney and Lynne Adams appears as a companion of Kelly. Caroline Goodall portrays Highland Park High School teacher Mrs. Duke in the classroom sequences imagined by Glass. Making uncredited appearances are Sean Cullen as The New Republic\\'s attorney and the film\\'s editor Jeffrey Ford as the voice of a security guard at the magazine\\'s office.\\n\\nProduction\\nProducer Craig Baumgarten, working with HBO executive Gaye Hirsch, optioned H.G. Bissinger\\'s Vanity Fair magazine article about Stephen Glass for an HBO original movie. They hired screenwriter Billy Ray based on the script he had written for the TNT film Legalese. Ray grew up with Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as his heroes and studied journalism for a year. It was this love for journalism that motivated him to make Shattered Glass.A sudden change in management put the film into turnaround and it remained inactive for two years until Cruise/Wagner Productions bought it from HBO. They took it to Lionsgate and Ray asked the studio if he could direct in addition to writing it. The challenge for Ray was to make the subject matter watchable because, according to the filmmaker, \"watching people write is deadly dull ... in a film like this, dialogue is what a character is willing to reveal about himself, and the camera is there to capture everything else\". The breakthrough for Ray came when he realized that the film\\'s real protagonist was not Glass but Chuck Lane. According to Ray, \"as fascinating as Stephen Glass is by the end of the movie people would want to kill themselves – you just can\\'t follow him all the way\". He used the Bissinger article as a starting point, which gave him a line of dialogue on which to hook the entire character of Glass: \"Are you mad at me?\" According to Ray, \"you can build an entire character around that notion, and we did\".The character of Caitlin Avey is an amalgamation of Glass\\' friends and The New Republic allies Hanna Rosin and Jonathan Chait.To prepare for the film, Ray interviewed and re-interviewed key figures for any relevant details. He signed some of them as paid consultants and gave several approval over the script. Early on, he spent a considerable amount of time trying to earn the trust of the people who had worked with Glass and get them to understand that he was going to be objective with the subject matter. The real Michael Kelly was so unhappy about how he was portrayed in Bissinger\\'s article that he threatened to sue when Ray first contacted him about the film and refused for two years to read Ray\\'s script, which he eventually approved. Ray attempted to contact Glass through his lawyers but was unsuccessful. Lionsgate lawyers asked Ray to give them an annotated script where he had to footnote every line of dialogue and every assertion and back them up with corresponding notes.The night before principal photography began in Montreal, Ray screened All the President\\'s Men for the cast and crew. He shot both halves of the film differently – in the first half, he used hand-held cameras in the scenes that took place in the offices of The New Republic, but when the Forbes editors begin to question Glass, the camerawork was more stable.Ray\\'s original cut of the film was a much more straightforward account of events but while editing the film he realized that it was not good enough. He raised additional funds to shoot the high school scenes that bookend the film.On April 3, 2003, a little more than six months before the film was released, Michael Kelly was killed while reporting on the invasion of Iraq. The film is dedicated to his memory.\\n\\nRelease\\nShattered Glass premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the Telluride Film Festival, the Boston Film Festival, the Woodstock Film Festival, the Mill Valley Film Festival, and the Austin Film Festival before opening on eight screens in New York City and Los Angeles on October 31, 2003. It grossed $77,540 on its opening weekend. It eventually earned $2,220,008 in North America and $724,744 in other  markets for a total worldwide box office of $2,944,752.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 91% \"Certified Fresh\" rating, based on 172 reviews, with an average rating of 7.68/10. The site\\'s consensus states: \"A compelling look at Stephen Glass\\' fall from grace.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".A. O. Scott of The New York Times described the film as \"a serious, well-observed examination of the practice of journalism,\" and \"an astute and surprisingly gripping drama.\" He added, \"A more showily ambitious film might have tried to delve into Glass\\'s personal history in search of an explanation for his behavior, or to draw provocative connections between that behavior and the cultural and political climate of the times. Such a movie would also have been conventional, facile and ultimately false. Mr. Ray knows better than to sensationalize a story about the dangers of sensationalism. Shattered Glass is good enough to be true\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and felt the film was well-cast and \"deserves comparison with All the President\\'s Men among movies about journalism\". In a dissenting review from The Village Voice, J. Hoberman dismissed the film as \"self-important yet insipid,\" and asks, \"Shattered Glass begs a larger question: What sort of culture elevates Glass for his entertainment value, punishes him for being too entertaining, rewards his notoriety, and then resurrects him again as a moral object lesson?\"Sarsgaard\\'s performance as Charles Lane was singled out by several critics for praise.  USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote of him: \"Sarsgaard deserves more credit than he\\'ll probably get for his multi-layered performance\". Premiere\\'s Glenn Kenny wrote, \"it\\'s Peter Sarsgaard, as the editor who serves Glass his just desserts [sic], who walks away with the picture, metamorphosing his character\\'s stiffness into a moral indignation that\\'s jolting and, finally, invigorating\". His performance ended up winning numerous awards, including \"Best Supporting Actor\" citations from the Boston Society of Film Critics, Kansas City Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics, Online Film Critics Society, San Francisco Film Critics Circle, and the Toronto Film Critics Association, as well as nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards and the Golden Globes. The A.V. Club placed his portrayal of Chuck Lane at number six on a list of the best performances of the decade.Stephen Glass saw the film and, when reflecting about the experience, he said, \"It was very painful for me. It was like being on a guided tour of the moments of my life I am most ashamed of\".\\n\\nAwards and nominations\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nShattered Glass at IMDb\\nShattered Glass at Box Office Mojo\\nShattered Glass at Rotten Tomatoes\\nShattered Glass at Metacritic\\nShattered Glass on MUBI',\n",

              " 'Stanley Kubrick': 'Stanley Kubrick (; July 26, 1928 – March 7, 1999) was an American film director, producer, screenwriter, and photographer. He is frequently cited as one of the greatest filmmakers in cinematic history. His films, which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories, cover a wide range of genres, and are noted for their realism, dark humor, unique cinematography, extensive set designs, and evocative use of music.\\nKubrick was raised in the Bronx, New York City, and attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. He received average grades, but displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school. After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he began making short films on a shoestring budget, and made his first major Hollywood film, The Killing, for United Artists in 1956. This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas—the war picture Paths of Glory (1957) and the historical epic Spartacus (1960).\\nCreative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of the Hollywood industry, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first productions in Britain were two films with Peter Sellers, Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964).\\nA demanding perfectionist, Kubrick assumed control over most aspects of the filmmaking process, from direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging scenes, working in close coordination with his actors and other collaborators. He often asked for several dozen retakes of the same shot in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts. Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick\\'s films broke new ground in cinematography. The scientific realism and innovative special effects of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) were without precedent in the history of cinema, and the film earned him his only personal Oscar, for Best Visual Effects. Steven Spielberg has referred to the film as his generation\\'s \"big bang\"; it is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. For the 18th-century period film Barry Lyndon (1975), Kubrick obtained lenses developed by Zeiss for NASA, to film scenes under natural candlelight. With The Shining (1980), he became one of the first directors to make use of a Steadicam for stabilized and fluid tracking shots. While many of Kubrick\\'s films were controversial and initially received mixed reviews upon release—particularly A Clockwork Orange (1971), which Kubrick pulled from circulation in the UK following a mass media frenzy—most were nominated for Oscars, Golden Globes, or BAFTA Awards, and underwent critical reevaluations. His last film, Eyes Wide Shut, was completed shortly before his death in 1999 at the age of 70.\\n\\nEarly life\\nKubrick was born on July 26, 1928, in the Lying-In Hospital at 307 Second Avenue in Manhattan, New York City to a Jewish family. He was the first of two children of Jacob Leonard Kubrick (May 21, 1902 – October 19, 1985), known as Jack or Jacques, and his wife Sadie Gertrude Kubrick (née Perveler; October 28, 1903 – April 23, 1985), known as Gert. His sister Barbara Mary Kubrick was born in May 1934. Jack Kubrick, whose parents and paternal grandparents were of Polish-Jewish, Austrian-Jewish, and Romanian-Jewish origin, was a homeopathic doctor, graduating from the New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1927, the same year he married Kubrick\\'s mother, the child of Austrian-Jewish immigrants. Kubrick\\'s great-grandfather, Hersh Kubrick (also spelled Kubrik or Kubrike), arrived at Ellis Island via Liverpool by ship on December 27, 1899, at the age of 47, leaving behind his wife and two grown children, one of whom was Stanley\\'s grandfather Elias, to start a new life with a younger woman. Elias Kubrick followed in 1902. At Stanley\\'s birth the Kubricks lived in an apartment at 2160 Clinton Avenue in the Bronx. His parents had been married in a Jewish ceremony, but Kubrick did not have a religious upbringing and would later profess an atheistic view of the universe. His father earned a good income as a physician and by the standards of the West Bronx the family was fairly wealthy.Soon after his sister\\'s birth, Kubrick began schooling in Public School 3 in the Bronx and moved to Public School 90 in June 1938. His IQ was discovered to be above average but his attendance was poor, and he missed 56 days in his first term alone, as many as he attended. He displayed an interest in literature from a young age and began reading Greek and Roman myths and the fables of the Grimm brothers which \"instilled in him a lifelong affinity with Europe\". He spent most Saturdays during the summer watching the New York Yankees and would later photograph two boys watching the game in an assignment for Look magazine to emulate his own childhood excitement with baseball. When Kubrick was 12 his father Jack taught him chess. The game remained a lifelong interest of Kubrick\\'s, appearing in many of his films. Kubrick, who later became a member of the United States Chess Federation, explained that chess helped him develop \"patience and discipline\" in making decisions. At the age of 13, Kubrick\\'s father bought him a Graflex camera, triggering a fascination with still photography. He befriended a neighbor, Marvin Traub, who shared his passion for photography. Traub had his own darkroom where he and the young Kubrick would spend many hours perusing photographs and watching the chemicals \"magically make images on photographic paper\". The two indulged in numerous photographic projects for which they roamed the streets looking for interesting subjects to capture and spent time in local cinemas studying films. Freelance photographer Weegee (Arthur Fellig) had a considerable influence on Kubrick\\'s development as a photographer; Kubrick would later hire Fellig as the special stills photographer for Dr. Strangelove (1964). As a teenager Kubrick was also interested in jazz, and briefly attempted a career as a drummer.Kubrick attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. One of his classmates was Edith Gormezano, later known as the singer Eydie Gormé. Though he joined the school\\'s photographic club, which permitted him to photograph the school\\'s events in their magazine, he was a mediocre student, with a meager 67/D+ grade average. Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945 but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated any hope of higher education. Later in life Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of contemporary American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and student interest. His father was disappointed in his son\\'s failure to achieve the excellence in school of which he knew Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the family library at home, while at the same time permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.\\n\\nPhotographic career\\nWhile still in high school Kubrick was chosen as an official school photographer. In the mid-1940s, since he was not able to gain admission to day session classes at colleges, he briefly attended evening classes at the City College of New York. Eventually he sold a photographic series to Look magazine, having brought a photo to Helen O\\'Brian, the head of the photographic department, who then purchased it for £25. It was printed on June 26, 1945. Kubrick supplemented his income by playing chess \"for quarters\" in Washington Square Park and various Manhattan chess clubs.\\n\\nIn 1946, he became an apprentice photographer for Look and later a full-time staff photographer. G. Warren Schloat, Jr., another new photographer for the magazine at the time, recalled that he thought Kubrick lacked the personality to make it as a director in Hollywood, remarking, \"Stanley was a quiet fellow. He didn\\'t say much. He was thin, skinny, and kind of poor—like we all were.\" Kubrick quickly became known for his story-telling in photographs. His first, published on April 16, 1946, was entitled \"A Short Story from a Movie Balcony\" and staged a fracas between a man and a woman, during which the man is slapped in the face, caught genuinely by surprise. In another assignment, 18 pictures were taken of various people waiting in a dental office. It has been said retrospectively that this project demonstrated an early interest of Kubrick in capturing individuals and their feelings in mundane environments. In 1948, he was sent to Portugal to document a travel piece, and covered the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Sarasota, Florida. Kubrick, a boxing enthusiast, eventually began photographing boxing matches for the magazine. His earliest, \"Prizefighter\", was published on January 18, 1949, and captured a boxing match and the events leading up to it, featuring Walter Cartier. On April 2, 1949, he published a photo essay, named \"Chicago-City of Extremes\" in Look, which displayed his talent early on for creating atmosphere with imagery, including a photograph taken above a congested Chicago street at night. The following year, on July 18, 1950, the magazine published his photo essay, \"Working Debutante – Betsy von Furstenberg\", which featured a Pablo Picasso portrait of Angel F. de Soto in the background. Kubrick was also assigned to photograph numerous jazz musicians, from Frank Sinatra and Erroll Garner to George Lewis, Eddie Condon, Phil Napoleon, Papa Celestin, Alphonse Picou, Muggsy Spanier, Sharkey Bonano, and others.Kubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz on May 28, 1948. They lived together in a small apartment at 36 West 16th Street, off Sixth Avenue just north of Greenwich Village. During this time, Kubrick began frequenting film screenings at the Museum of Modern Art and the cinemas of New York City. He was inspired by the complex, fluid camerawork of the director Max Ophüls, whose films influenced Kubrick\\'s later visual style, and by the director Elia Kazan, whom he described as America\\'s \"best director\" at that time, with his ability of \"performing miracles\" with his actors. Friends began to notice that Kubrick had become obsessed with the art of filmmaking—one friend, David Vaughan, observed that Kubrick would scrutinize the film at the cinema when it went silent, and would go back to reading his paper when people started talking. He also spent many hours reading books on film theory and writing down notes. Sergei Eisenstein\\'s theoretical writings had a profound impact on Kubrick, and he took a great number of notes from books in the library of Arthur Rothstein, the photographic technical director of Look magazine.\\n\\nFilm career\\nShort films (1951–1953)\\nKubrick shared a love of film with his school friend Alexander Singer, who after graduating from high school had the intention of directing a film version of Homer\\'s Iliad. Through Singer, who worked in the offices of the newsreel production company, The March of Time, Kubrick learned that it could cost $40,000 to make a proper short film, money he could not afford. He had $1500 in savings and managed to produce a few short documentaries fueled by encouragement from Singer. He began learning all he could about filmmaking on his own, calling film suppliers, laboratories, and equipment rental houses.Kubrick decided to make a short film documentary about boxer Walter Cartier, whom he had photographed and written about for Look magazine a year earlier. He rented a camera and produced a 16-minute black-and-white documentary, Day of the Fight. Kubrick found the money independently to finance it. He had considered asking Montgomery Clift to narrate it, whom he had met during a photographic session for Look, but settled on CBS news veteran Douglas Edwards. According to Paul Duncan the film was \"remarkably accomplished for a first film\", and used a backward tracking shot to film a scene in which Cartier and his brother walk towards the camera, a device which later became one of Kubrick\\'s characteristic camera movements. Vincent Cartier, Walter\\'s brother and manager, later reflected on his observations of Kubrick during the filming. He said, \"Stanley was a very stoic, impassive but imaginative type person with strong, imaginative thoughts. He commanded respect in a quiet, shy way. Whatever he wanted, you complied, he just captivated you. Anybody who worked with Stanley did just what Stanley wanted\". After a score was added by Singer\\'s friend Gerald Fried, Kubrick had spent $3900 in making it, and sold it to RKO-Pathé for $4000, which was the most the company had ever paid for a short film at the time. Kubrick described his first effort at filmmaking as having been valuable since he believed himself to have been forced to do most of the work, and he later declared that the \"best education in film is to make one\".\\nInspired by this early success, Kubrick quit his job at Look and visited professional filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about the technical aspects of filmmaking. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker because of the number of bad films he had seen, remarking, \"I don\\'t know a goddamn thing about movies, but I know I can make a better film than that\". He began making Flying Padre (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally going to be called \"Sky Pilot\", a pun on the slang term for a priest. During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in Flying Padre are later echoed in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein\\'s Battleship Potemkin (1925) and Ivan the Terrible (1944/1958).Flying Padre was followed by The Seafarers (1953), Kubrick\\'s first color film, which was shot for the Seafarers International Union in June 1953. It depicted the logistics of a democratic union and focused more on the amenities of seafaring other than the act. For the cafeteria scene in the film, Kubrick chose a dolly shot to establish the life of the seafarer\\'s community; this kind of shot would later become a signature technique. The sequence of Paul Hall, secretary-treasurer of the SIU Atlantic and gulf district, speaking to members of the union echoes scenes from Eisenstein\\'s Strike (1925) and October (1928). Day of the Fight, Flying Padre and The Seafarers constitute Kubrick\\'s only surviving documentary works; some historians believe he made others.\\n\\nEarly feature work (1953–1955)\\nAfter raising $1000 showing his short films to friends and family, Kubrick found the finances to begin making his first feature film, Fear and Desire (1953), originally running with the title The Trap, written by his friend Howard Sackler. Kubrick\\'s uncle, Martin Perveler, a Los Angeles pharmacy owner, invested a further $9000 on condition that he be credited as executive producer of the film. Kubrick assembled several actors and a small crew totaling 14 people (five actors, five crewmen, and four others to help transport the equipment) and flew to the San Gabriel Mountains in California for a five-week, low-budget shoot.   Later renamed The Shape of Fear before finally being named Fear and Desire, it is a fictional allegory about a team of soldiers who survive a plane crash and are caught behind enemy lines in a war. During the course of the film, one of the soldiers becomes infatuated with an attractive girl in the woods and binds her to a tree. This scene is noted for its close-ups on the face of the actress. Kubrick had intended for Fear and Desire to be a silent picture in order to ensure low production costs; the added sounds, effects, and music ultimately brought production costs to around $53,000, exceeding the budget. He was bailed out by producer Richard de Rochemont on the condition that he help in de Rochemont\\'s production of a five-part television series about Abraham Lincoln on location in Hodgenville, Kentucky.Fear and Desire was a commercial failure, but garnered several positive reviews upon release. Critics such as the reviewer from The New York Times believed that Kubrick\\'s professionalism as a photographer shone through in the picture, and that he \"artistically caught glimpses of the grotesque attitudes of death, the wolfishness of hungry men, as well as their bestiality, and in one scene, the wracking effect of lust on a pitifully juvenile soldier and the pinioned girl he is guarding\". Columbia University scholar Mark Van Doren was highly impressed by the scenes with the girl bound to the tree, remarking that it would live on as a \"beautiful, terrifying and weird\" sequence which illustrated Kubrick\\'s immense talent and guaranteed his future success. Kubrick himself later expressed embarrassment with Fear and Desire, and attempted over the years to keep prints of the film out of circulation. During the production of the film, Kubrick almost killed his cast with poisonous gasses by mistake.Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick began working on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the commercial failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer\\'s Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer\\'s involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like Fear and Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick\\'s family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.Alfred Hitchcock\\'s Blackmail (1929) directly influenced the film with the painting laughing at a character, and Martin Scorsese has, in turn, cited Kubrick\\'s innovative shooting angles and atmospheric shots in Killer\\'s Kiss as an influence on Raging Bull (1980). Actress Irene Kane, the star of Killer\\'s Kiss, observed: \"Stanley\\'s a fascinating character. He thinks movies should move, with a minimum of dialogue, and he\\'s all for sex and sadism\". Killer\\'s Kiss met with limited commercial success and made very little money in comparison with its production budget of $75,000. Critics have praised the film\\'s camerawork, but its acting and story are generally considered mediocre.\\n\\nHollywood success and beyond (1956–1962)\\nWhile playing chess in Washington Square, Kubrick met producer James B. Harris, who considered Kubrick \"the most intelligent, most creative person I have ever come in contact with.\" The two formed the Harris-Kubrick Pictures Corporation in 1955. Harris purchased the rights to Lionel White\\'s novel Clean Break for $10,000 and Kubrick wrote the script, but at Kubrick\\'s suggestion, they hired film noir novelist Jim Thompson to write the dialog for the film—which became The Killing (1956)—about a meticulously planned racetrack robbery gone wrong. The film starred Sterling Hayden, with whom Kubrick had been impressed in The Asphalt Jungle (1950).Kubrick and Harris moved to Los Angeles from New York City and signed with the Jaffe Agency to shoot the picture, which became Kubrick\\'s first full-length feature film shot with a professional cast and crew. The Union in Hollywood stated that Kubrick would not be permitted to be both the director and the cinematographer of the movie, so veteran cinematographer Lucien Ballard was hired for the shooting. Kubrick agreed to waive his fee for the production, which was shot in just 24 days on a budget of $330,000. He clashed with Ballard during the shooting, and on one occasion Kubrick threatened to fire Ballard following a camera dispute, despite being only 27 years old at the time and 20 years Ballard\\'s junior. Hayden recalled that Kubrick was \"cold and detached. Very mechanical, always confident. I\\'ve worked with few directors who are that good\".The Killing failed to secure a proper release across the United States; the film made little money, and was promoted only at the last minute, as a second feature to the Western movie Bandido! (1956). Several contemporary critics lauded the film, with a reviewer for Time comparing its camerawork to that of Orson Welles. Today, critics generally consider The Killing to be among the best films of Kubrick\\'s early career; its nonlinear narrative and clinical execution also had a major influence on later directors of crime films, including Quentin Tarantino. Dore Schary of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was highly impressed as well, and offered Kubrick and Harris $75,000 to write, direct, and produce a film, which ultimately became Paths of Glory (1957).\\n\\nPaths of Glory, set during World War I, is based on Humphrey Cobb\\'s 1935 antiwar novel, which Kubrick had read while waiting in his father\\'s office. Schary was familiar with the novel, but stated that MGM would not finance another war picture, given their backing of the anti-war film The Red Badge of Courage (1951). After Schary was fired by MGM in a major shake-up, Kubrick and Harris managed to interest Kirk Douglas in playing Colonel Dax. The film, shot in Munich, from January 1957, follows a French army unit ordered on an impossible mission, and follows with a war trial of three soldiers, arbitrarily chosen, for misconduct. Dax is assigned to defend the men at Court Martial. For the battle scene, Kubrick meticulously lined up six cameras one after the other along the boundary of no-man\\'s land, with each camera capturing a specific field and numbered, and gave each of the hundreds of extras a number for the zone in which they would die. Kubrick himself operated an Arriflex camera for the battle, zooming in on Douglas. Paths of Glory became Kubrick\\'s first significant commercial success, and established him as an up-and-coming young filmmaker. Critics praised the film\\'s unsentimental, spare, and unvarnished combat scenes and its raw, black-and-white cinematography. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote: \"The close, hard eye of Mr Kubrick\\'s sullen camera bores directly into the minds of scheming men and into the hearts of patient, frightened soldiers who have to accept orders to die\". Despite the praise, the Christmas release date was criticized, and the subject was controversial in Europe. The film was banned in France until 1974 for its \"unflattering\" depiction of the French military, and was censored by the Swiss Army until 1970.\\n\\nMarlon Brando contacted Kubrick, asking him to direct a film adaptation of the Charles Neider western novel, The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones, featuring Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. Brando was impressed, saying that \"Stanley is unusually perceptive, and delicately attuned to people. He has an adroit intellect, and is a creative thinker—not a repeater, not a fact-gatherer. He digests what he learns and brings to a new project an original point of view and a reserved passion\". The two worked on a script for six months, begun by a then unknown Sam Peckinpah. Many disputes broke out over the project, and in the end, Kubrick distanced himself from what would become One-Eyed Jacks (1961).In February 1959, Kubrick received a phone call from Kirk Douglas asking him to direct Spartacus (1960), based on the true life story of the historical figure Spartacus and the events of the Third Servile War. Douglas had acquired the rights to the novel by Howard Fast and blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo began penning the script. It was produced by Douglas, who also starred as rebellious slave Spartacus, and cast Laurence Olivier as his foe, the Roman general and politician Marcus Licinius Crassus. Douglas hired Kubrick for a reported fee of $150,000 to take over direction soon after he fired director Anthony Mann. Kubrick had, at 31, already directed four feature films, and this became his largest by far, with a cast of over 10,000 and a budget of $6 million. At the time, this was the most expensive film ever made in America, and Kubrick became the youngest director in Hollywood history to make an epic. It was the first time that Kubrick filmed using the anamorphic 35mm horizontal Super Technirama process to achieve ultra-high definition, which allowed him to capture large panoramic scenes, including one with 8,000 trained soldiers from Spain representing the Roman army. Disputes broke out during the filming. Kubrick complained about not having full creative control over the artistic aspects, insisting on improvising extensively during the production. Kubrick and Douglas were also at odds over the script, with Kubrick angering Douglas when he cut all but two of his lines from the opening 30 minutes. Despite the on-set troubles, Spartacus took $14.6 million at the box office in its first run. The film established Kubrick as a major director, receiving six Academy Award nominations and winning four; it ultimately convinced him that if so much could be made of such a problematic production, he could achieve anything. Spartacus also marked the end of the working relationship between Kubrick and Douglas.\\n\\nCollaboration with Peter Sellers (1962–1964)\\nLolita\\nKubrick and Harris made a decision to film Kubrick\\'s next movie Lolita (1962) in England, due to clauses placed on the contract by producers Warner Bros. that gave them complete control over every aspect of the film, and the fact that the Eady plan permitted producers to write off the costs if 80% of the crew were British. Instead, they signed a $1 million deal with Eliot Hyman\\'s Associated Artists Productions, and a clause which gave them the artistic freedom that they desired. Lolita, Kubrick\\'s first attempt at black comedy, was an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov, the story of a middle-aged college professor becoming infatuated with a 12-year-old girl. Stylistically, Lolita, starring Peter Sellers, James Mason, Shelley Winters, and Sue Lyon, was a transitional film for Kubrick, \"marking the turning point from a naturalistic cinema ... to the surrealism of the later films\", according to film critic Gene Youngblood. Kubrick was deeply impressed by the chameleon-like range of actor Peter Sellers and gave him one of his first opportunities to improvise wildly during shooting, while filming him with three cameras.Lolita was shot over 88 days on a budget of $2 million at Elstree Studios, between October 1960 and March 1961. Kubrick often clashed with Shelley Winters, whom he found \"very difficult\" and demanding, and nearly fired at one point. Because of its provocative story, Lolita was Kubrick\\'s first film to generate controversy; he was ultimately forced to comply with censors and remove much of the erotic element of the relationship between Mason\\'s Humbert and Lyon\\'s Lolita which had been evident in Nabokov\\'s novel. The film was not a major critical or commercial success upon release, earning $3.7 million at the box office on its opening run. Lolita has since become acclaimed by film critics. Social historian Stephen E. Kercher documented that the film \"demonstrated that its director possessed a keen, satiric insight into the social landscape and sexual hang-ups of cold war America\", while Jon Fortgang of Film4 wrote: \"Lolita, with its acute mix of pathos and comedy, and Mason\\'s mellifluous delivery of Nabokov\\'s sparkling lines, remains the definitive depiction of tragic transgression\".\\n\\nDr. Strangelove\\nKubrick\\'s next project was Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), another satirical black comedy. Kubrick became preoccupied with the issue of nuclear war as the Cold War unfolded in the 1950s, and even considered moving to Australia because he feared that New York City might be a likely target for the Russians. He studied over 40 military and political research books on the subject and eventually reached the conclusion that \"nobody really knew anything and the whole situation was absurd\".After buying the rights to the novel Red Alert, Kubrick collaborated with its author, Peter George, on the script. It was originally written as a serious political thriller, but Kubrick decided that a \"serious treatment\" of the subject would not be believable, and thought that some of its most salient points would be fodder for comedy. Kubrick\\'s longtime producer-and-friend, James B. Harris, thought the film should be serious, and the two parted ways, amicably, over this disagreement -- Harris going on to produce and direct the serious cold-war thriller The Bedford Incident.  Kubrick and Red Alert author George then reworked the script as a satire (provisionally titled \"The Delicate Balance of Terror\") in which the plot of Red Alert was situated as a film-within-a-film made by an alien intelligence, but this idea was also abandoned, and Kubrick decided to make the film as \"an outrageous black comedy\". \\nJust before filming began, Kubrick hired noted journalist and satirical author Terry Southern to transform the script into its final form, a black comedy, loaded with sexual innuendo, becoming a film which showed Kubrick\\'s talents as a \"unique kind of absurdist\" according to the film scholar Abrams. Southern made major contributions to the final script, and was co-credited (above Peter George) in the film\\'s opening titles; his perceived role in the writing later led to a public rift between Kubrick and Peter George, who subsequently complained in a letter to Life magazine that Southern\\'s intense but relatively brief (November 16 to December 28, 1962) involvement with the project was being given undue prominence in the media, while his own role as the author of the film\\'s source novel, and his ten-month stint as the script\\'s co-writer, were being downplayed – a perception Kubrick evidently did little to address.Kubrick found that Dr. Strangelove, a $2 million production which employed what became the \"first important visual effects crew in the world\", would be impossible to make in the U.S. for various technical and political reasons, forcing him to move production to England. It was shot in 15 weeks, ending in April 1963, after which Kubrick spent eight months editing it. Peter Sellers again agreed to work with Kubrick, and ended up playing three different roles in the film.Upon release, the film stirred up much controversy and mixed opinions. The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther worried that it was a \"discredit and even contempt for our whole defense establishment ... the most shattering sick joke I\\'ve ever come across\",  while Robert Brustein of Out of This World in a February 1970 article called it a \"juvenalian satire\". Kubrick responded to the criticism, stating: \"A satirist is someone who has a very skeptical view of human nature, but who still has the optimism to make some sort of a joke out of it. However brutal that joke might be\". Today, the film is considered to be one of the sharpest comedy films ever made, and holds a near perfect 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 91 reviews as of November 2020. It was named the 39th-greatest American film and third-greatest American comedy film of all time by the American Film Institute, and in 2010, it was named the sixth-best comedy film of all time by The Guardian.\\n\\nGround-breaking cinema (1965–1971)\\nKubrick spent five years developing his next film, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), having been highly impressed with science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke\\'s novel Childhood\\'s End, about a superior race of alien beings who assist mankind in eliminating their old selves. After meeting Clarke in New York City in April 1964, Kubrick made the suggestion to work on his 1948 short story The Sentinel, about a monolith which is found on the Moon which alerts aliens of mankind. That year, Clarke began writing the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the screenplay was written by Kubrick and Clarke in collaboration. The film\\'s theme, the birthing of one intelligence by another, is developed in two parallel intersecting stories on two very different time scales. One depicts evolutionary transitions between various stages of man, from ape to \"star child\", as man is reborn into a new existence, each step shepherded by an enigmatic alien intelligence seen only in its artifacts: a series of seemingly indestructible eons-old black monoliths. In space, the enemy is a supercomputer known as HAL  who runs the spaceship, a character which novelist Clancy Sigal described as being \"far, far more human, more humorous and conceivably decent than anything else that may emerge from this far-seeing enterprise\".Kubrick spent a great deal of time researching for the film, paying particular attention to accuracy and detail in what the future might look like. He was granted permission by NASA to observe the spacecraft being used in the Ranger 9 mission for accuracy. Filming commenced on December 29, 1965, with the excavation of the monolith on the moon, and footage was shot in Namib Desert in early 1967, with the ape scenes completed later that year. The special effects team continued working diligently until the end of the year to complete the film, taking the cost to $10.5 million. 2001: A Space Odyssey was conceived as a Cinerama spectacle and was photographed in Super Panavision 70, giving the viewer a \"dazzling mix of imagination and science\" through ground-breaking effects, which earned Kubrick his only personal Oscar, an Academy Award for Visual Effects. Louise Sweeney of The Christian Science Monitor called the film the \"ultimate trip\" while praising one of the scenes where the viewer moves through space while witnessing a vibrant mix of lighting, color, and patterns. Kubrick said of the concept of the film in an interview with Rolling Stone: \"On the deepest psychological level, the film\\'s plot symbolized the search for God, and finally postulates what is little less than a scientific definition of God. The film revolves around this metaphysical conception, and the realistic hardware and the documentary feelings about everything were necessary in order to undermine your built-in resistance to the poetical concept\".Upon release in 1968, 2001: A Space Odyssey was not an immediate hit among critics, who faulted its lack of dialog, slow pacing, and seemingly impenetrable storyline. The film appeared to defy genre convention, much unlike any science-fiction movie before it, and clearly different from any of Kubrick\\'s earlier films or stories. Kubrick was particularly outraged by a scathing review from Pauline Kael, who called it \"the biggest amateur movie of them all\", with Kubrick doing \"really every dumb thing he ever wanted to do\". Despite mixed reviews from critics at that time, 2001: A Space Odyssey gradually gained popularity and earned $31 million worldwide by the end of 1972. Today, it is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, and is a staple on All Time Top 10 lists. Baxter describes the film as \"one of the most admired and discussed creations in the history of cinema\", and Steven Spielberg has referred to it as \"the big bang of his film making generation\". For biographer Vincent LoBrutto it \"positioned Stanley Kubrick as a pure artist ranked among the masters of cinema\".\\n\\nAfter completing 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick searched for a project that he could film quickly on a more modest budget. He settled on A Clockwork Orange (1971) at the end of 1969, an exploration of violence and experimental rehabilitation by law enforcement authorities, based around the character of Alex (portrayed by Malcolm McDowell). Kubrick had originally received a copy of Anthony Burgess\\'s novel of the same name from Terry Southern while they were working on Dr. Strangelove, but had rejected it on the grounds that Nadsat, a street language for young teenagers, was too difficult to comprehend. The decision to make a film about the degeneration of youth reflected contemporary concerns in 1969; the New Hollywood movement was creating a great number of films that depicted the sexuality and rebelliousness of young people. This influenced Kubrick, in Baxter\\'s opinion. A Clockwork Orange was shot over 1970–1971 on a budget of £2 million. Kubrick abandoned his use of CinemaScope in the filming, deciding that the 1.66:1 widescreen format was, in the words of Baxter, an \"acceptable compromise between spectacle and intimacy\", and favored his \"rigorously symmetrical framing\", which \"increased the beauty of his compositions\". The film heavily features \"pop erotica\" of the period, including a giant white plastic set of male genitals, decor which Kubrick had intended to give it a \"slightly futuristic\" look. McDowell\\'s role in Lindsay Anderson\\'s if.... (1968) was crucial to his casting as Alex, and Kubrick professed that he probably would not have made the film if McDowell had been unavailable.\\n\\nBecause of its depiction of teenage violence, A Clockwork Orange became one of the most controversial films of its time, and part of an ongoing debate about violence and its glorification in cinema. It received an X rating, or certificate, in both the UK and US, on its release just before Christmas 1971, though many critics saw much of the violence depicted in the film as satirical, and less violent than Straw Dogs, which had been released a month earlier. Kubrick personally pulled the film from release in the United Kingdom after receiving death threats following a series of copycat crimes based on the film; it was thus completely unavailable legally in the UK until after Kubrick\\'s death, and not re-released until 2000. John Trevelyan, the censor of the film, personally considered A Clockwork Orange to be \"perhaps the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I\\'ve ever seen,\" and believed it to present an \"intellectual argument rather than a sadistic spectacle\" in its depiction of violence, but acknowledged that many would not agree. Negative media hype over the film notwithstanding, A Clockwork Orange received four Academy Award nominations, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, and was named by the New York Film Critics Circle as the Best Film of 1971. After William Friedkin won Best Director for The French Connection that year, he told the press: \"Speaking personally, I think Stanley Kubrick is the best American film-maker of the year. In fact, not just this year, but the best, period\".\\n\\nPeriod and horror filming (1972–1980)\\nBarry Lyndon (1975) is an adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray\\'s The Luck of Barry Lyndon (also known as Barry Lyndon), a picaresque novel about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish rogue and social climber. John Calley of Warner Bros. agreed in 1972 to invest $2.5 million into the film, on condition that Kubrick approach major Hollywood stars, to ensure it of success. Like previous films, Kubrick and his art department conducted an enormous amount of research, and he went from knowing very little about the 18th century at the start of the production to becoming an expert on it. Extensive photographs were taken of locations and artwork in particular, and paintings were meticulously replicated from works of the great masters of the period in the film. The film was shot on location in Ireland, beginning in the autumn of 1973, at a cost of $11 million with a cast and crew of 170. The decision to shoot in Ireland stemmed from the fact that it still retained many buildings from the 18th century period which England lacked. The production was problematic from the start, plagued with heavy rain and political strife involving Northern Ireland at the time. After Kubrick received death threats from the IRA in the New Year of 1974 due to the shooting scenes with English soldiers, he fled Ireland with his family on a ferry from Dún Laoghaire under an assumed identity and resumed filming in England.\\n\\nBaxter notes that Barry Lyndon was the film which made Kubrick notorious for paying scrupulous attention to detail, often demanding twenty or thirty retakes of the same scene to perfect his art. Often considered to be his most authentic-looking picture, the cinematography and lighting techniques that Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott used in Barry Lyndon were highly innovative. Interior scenes were shot with a specially adapted high-speed f/0.7 Zeiss camera lens originally developed for NASA to be used in satellite photography. The lenses allowed many scenes to be lit only with candlelight, creating two-dimensional, diffused-light images reminiscent of 18th-century paintings. Cinematographer Allen Daviau states that the method gives the audience a way of seeing the characters and scenes as they would have been seen by people at the time. Many of the fight scenes were shot with a hand-held camera to produce a \"sense of documentary realism and immediacy\".Barry Lyndon found a great audience in France, but was a box office failure, grossing just $9.5 million in the American market, not even close to the $30 million Warner Bros. needed to generate a profit. The pace and length of Barry Lyndon at three hours put off many American critics and audiences, but the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four, including Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, and Best Musical Score, more than any other Kubrick film. As with most of Kubrick\\'s films, Barry Lyndon\\'s reputation has grown through the years and it is now considered to be one of his best, particularly among filmmakers and critics. Numerous polls, such as The Village Voice (1999), Sight & Sound (2002), and Time (2005), have rated it as one of the greatest films ever made. As of March 2019, it has a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 64 reviews. Roger Ebert referred to it as \"one of the most beautiful films ever made ... certainly in every frame a Kubrick film: technically awesome, emotionally distant, remorseless in its doubt of human goodness\".\\n\\nThe Shining, released in 1980, was adapted from the novel of the same name by bestselling horror writer Stephen King. The Shining was not the only horror film to which Kubrick had been linked; he had turned down the directing of both The Exorcist (1973) and Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977), despite once saying in 1966 to a friend that he had long desired to \"make the world\\'s scariest movie, involving a series of episodes that would play upon the nightmare fears of the audience\". The film stars Jack Nicholson as a writer who takes a job as a winter caretaker of a large and isolated hotel in the Rocky Mountains. He spends the winter there with his wife, played by Shelley Duvall, and their young son, who displays paranormal abilities. During their stay, they confront both Jack\\'s descent into madness and apparent supernatural horrors lurking in the hotel. Kubrick gave his actors freedom to extend the script, and even improvise on occasion, and as a result, Nicholson was responsible for the \\'Here\\'s Johnny!\\' line and scene in which he\\'s sitting at the typewriter and unleashes his anger upon his wife. So determined to produce perfection was Kubrick, he often demanded up to 70 or 80 retakes of the same scene. Duvall, who Kubrick also intentionally isolated and argued with often, was forced to perform the iconic and exhausting baseball bat scene 127 times. Afterwards, Duvall presented Kubrick with clumps of hair that had fallen out due to the extreme stress of filming. The bar scene with the ghostly bartender was shot 36 times, while the kitchen scene between the characters of Danny (Danny Lloyd) and Halloran (Scatman Crothers) ran to 148 takes. The aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel were shot at Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon, while the interiors of the hotel were shot at Elstree Studios in England between May 1978 and April 1979. Cardboard models were made of all of the sets of the film, and the lighting of them was a massive undertaking, which took four months of electrical wiring. Kubrick made extensive use of the newly invented Steadicam, a weight-balanced camera support, which allowed for smooth hand-held camera movement in scenes where a conventional camera track was impractical. According to Garrett Brown, Steadicam\\'s inventor, it was the first picture to use its full potential.Five days after release on May 23, 1980, Kubrick ordered the deletion of a final scene, in which the hotel manager Ullman (Barry Nelson) visits Wendy (Shelley Duvall) in hospital, believing it to have been unnecessary after witnessing the audience excitement in cinemas at the climax of the film. The Shining opened to strong box office takings, earning $1 million on the first weekend and earning $30.9 million in America alone by the end of the year. The original critical response was mixed, and King himself detested the film and disliked Kubrick. Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the \"eerie way\" in which Kubrick turned an \"enormous building into something cramped and claustrophobic\", which would \"undoubtedly amount to one of the screen\\'s scarier haunted houses\". The Shining is now considered to be a horror classic, and the American Film Institute has ranked it as the 27th greatest thriller film of all time.\\n\\nLater work and final years (1981–1999)\\nKubrick met author Michael Herr through mutual friend David Cornwell (novelist John le Carré) in 1980, and became interested in his book Dispatches, about the Vietnam War. Herr had recently written Martin Sheen\\'s narration for Apocalypse Now (1979). Kubrick was also intrigued by Gustav Hasford\\'s Vietnam War novel The Short-Timers. With the vision in mind to shoot what would become Full Metal Jacket (1987), Kubrick began working with both Herr and Hasford separately on a script. He eventually found Hasford\\'s novel to be \"brutally honest\" and decided to shoot a film which closely follows the novel. All of the film was shot at a cost of $17 million within a 30-mile radius of his house between August 1985 and September 1986, later than scheduled as Kubrick shut down production for five months following a near-fatal accident with a jeep involving Lee Ermey. A derelict gasworks in Beckton in the London Docklands area posed as the ruined city of Huế, which makes the film visually very different from other Vietnam War films. Around 200 palm trees were imported via 40-foot trailers by road from North Africa, at a cost of £1000 a tree, and thousands of plastic plants were ordered from Hong Kong to provide foliage for the film. Kubrick explained he made the film look realistic by using natural light, and achieved a \"newsreel effect\" by making the Steadicam shots less steady,  which reviewers and commentators thought contributed to the bleakness and seriousness of the film.According to critic Michel Ciment, the film contained some of Kubrick\\'s trademark characteristics, such as his selection of ironic music, portrayals of men being dehumanized, and attention to extreme detail to achieve realism. In a later scene, United States Marines patrol the ruins of an abandoned and destroyed city singing the theme song to the Mickey Mouse Club as a sardonic counterpoint. The film opened strongly in June 1987, taking over $30 million in the first 50 days alone, but critically it was overshadowed by the success of Oliver Stone\\'s Platoon, released a year earlier. Co-star Matthew Modine stated one of Kubrick\\'s favorite reviews read: \"The first half of FMJ is brilliant. Then the film degenerates into a masterpiece.\" Roger Ebert was not particularly impressed with it, awarding it a mediocre 2.5 out of 4. He concluded: \"Stanley Kubrick\\'s Full Metal Jacket is more like a book of short stories than a novel\", a \"strangely shapeless film from the man whose work usually imposes a ferociously consistent vision on his material\".Kubrick\\'s final film was Eyes Wide Shut (1999), starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a Manhattan couple on a sexual odyssey. Tom Cruise portrays a doctor who witnesses a bizarre masked quasireligious orgiastic ritual at a country mansion, a discovery which later threatens his life. The story is based on Arthur Schnitzler\\'s 1926 Freudian novella Traumnovelle (Dream Story in English), which Kubrick relocated from turn-of-the-century Vienna to New York City in the 1990s. Kubrick said of the novel: \"A difficult book to describe—what good book isn\\'t. It explores the sexual ambivalence of a happy marriage and tries to equate the importance of sexual dreams and might-have-beens with reality. All of Schnitzler\\'s work is psychologically brilliant\". Kubrick was almost 70, but worked relentlessly for 15 months to get the film out by its planned release date of July 16, 1999. He commenced a script with Frederic Raphael, and worked 18 hours a day, while maintaining complete confidentiality about the film.Eyes Wide Shut, like Lolita and A Clockwork Orange before it, faced censorship before release. Kubrick sent an unfinished preview copy to the stars and producers a few months before release, but his sudden death on March 7, 1999, came a few days after he finished editing. He never saw the final version released to the public, but he did see the preview of the film with Warner Bros., Cruise, and Kidman, and had reportedly told Warner executive Julian Senior that it was his \"best film ever\". At the time, critical opinion of the film was mixed, and it was viewed less favorably than most of Kubrick\\'s films. Roger Ebert awarded it 3.5 out of 4 stars, comparing the structure to a thriller and writing that it is \"like an erotic daydream about chances missed and opportunities avoided\", and thought that Kubrick\\'s use of lighting at Christmas made the film \"all a little garish, like an urban sideshow\". Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post disliked the film, writing that it \"is actually sad, rather than bad. It feels creaky, ancient, hopelessly out of touch, infatuated with the hot taboos of his youth and unable to connect with that twisty thing contemporary sexuality has become.\"\\n\\nA.I. Artificial Intelligence and unrealized projects\\nA.I. Artificial Intelligence\\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Kubrick collaborated with Brian Aldiss on an expansion of his short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" into a three-act film. It was a futuristic fairy tale about a robot that resembles and behaves as a child, and his efforts to become a \\'real boy\\' in a manner similar to Pinocchio. Kubrick approached Spielberg in 1995 with the AI script with the possibility of Steven Spielberg directing it and Kubrick producing it. Kubrick reportedly held long telephone discussions with Spielberg regarding the film, and, according to Spielberg, at one point stated that the subject matter was closer to Spielberg\\'s sensibilities than his.Following Kubrick\\'s death in 1999, Spielberg took the various drafts and notes left by Kubrick and his writers and composed a new screenplay based on an earlier 90-page story treatment by Ian Watson written under Kubrick\\'s supervision and according to Kubrick\\'s specifications. In association with what remained of Kubrick\\'s production unit, he directed the movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) which was produced by Kubrick\\'s longtime producer (and brother-in-law) Jan Harlan. Sets, costumes, and art direction were based on the works of conceptual artist Chris Baker, who had also done much of his work under Kubrick\\'s supervision.Spielberg was able to function autonomously in Kubrick\\'s absence, but said he felt \"inhibited to honor him\", and followed Kubrick\\'s visual schema with as much fidelity as he could, according to author Joseph McBride. Spielberg, who once referred to Kubrick as \"the greatest master I ever served\", now with production underway, admitted, \"I felt like I was being coached by a ghost.\" The film was released in June 2001. It contains a posthumous production credit for Stanley Kubrick at the beginning and the brief dedication \"For Stanley Kubrick\" at the end. John Williams\\'s score contains many allusions to pieces heard in other Kubrick films.\\n\\nNapoleon\\nFollowing 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick originally planned to make a film about the life of the French emperor Napoleon. Fascinated by his life and own \"self-destruction\", Kubrick spent a great deal of time planning the film\\'s development, and had conducted about two years of extensive research into Napoleon\\'s life, reading several hundred books and gaining access to Napoleon\\'s personal memoirs and commentaries. He also tried to see every film ever made about Napoleon and found none of them appealing, including Abel Gance\\'s 1927 film which is generally considered to be a masterpiece, but for Kubrick, a \"really terrible\" movie. LoBrutto states that Napoleon was an ideal subject for Kubrick, embracing Kubrick\\'s \"passion for control, power, obsession, strategy, and the military\", while Napoleon\\'s psychological intensity and depth, logistical genius and war, sex, and the evil nature of man were all ingredients which deeply appealed to Kubrick.Kubrick drafted a screenplay in 1961, and envisaged making a \"grandiose\" epic, with up to 40,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. He had intended hiring the armed forces of an entire country to make the film, as he considered Napoleonic battles to be \"so beautiful, like vast lethal ballets\", with an \"aesthetic brilliance that doesn\\'t require a military mind to appreciate\". He wanted them to be replicated as authentically as possible on screen. Kubrick had sent research teams to scout for locations across Europe, and commissioned screenwriter and director Andrew Birkin, one of his young assistants on 2001, to the Isle of Elba, Austerlitz, and Waterloo, taking thousands of pictures for his later perusal. Kubrick approached numerous stars to play leading roles, including Audrey Hepburn for Empress Josephine, a part which she could not accept due to semiretirement.\\nBritish actors David Hemmings and Ian Holm were considered for the lead role of Napoleon, before Jack Nicholson was cast. The film was well into preproduction and ready to begin filming in 1969 when MGM cancelled the project. Numerous reasons have been cited for the abandonment of the project, including its projected cost, a change of ownership at MGM, and the poor reception that the 1970 Soviet film about Napoleon, Waterloo, received. In 2011, Taschen published the book, Stanley Kubrick\\'s Napoleon: The Greatest Movie Never Made, a large volume compilation of literature and source documents from Kubrick, such as scene photo ideas and copies of letters Kubrick wrote and received. In March 2013, Steven Spielberg, who previously collaborated with Kubrick on A.I. Artificial Intelligence and is a passionate admirer of his work, announced that he would be developing Napoleon as a TV miniseries based on Kubrick\\'s original screenplay.\\n\\nOther projects\\nIn the 1950s, Kubrick and Harris developed a sitcom starring Ernie Kovacs and a film adaption of the book I Stole $16,000,000, but nothing came of them. Tony Frewin, an assistant who worked with the director for a long period of time, revealed in a 2013 Atlantic article: \"He [Kubrick] was limitlessly interested in anything to do with Nazis and desperately wanted to make a film on the subject.\" Kubrick had intended making a film about the life story of Dietrich Schulz-Koehn, a Nazi officer who used the pen name \"Dr. Jazz\" to write reviews of German music scenes during the Nazi era. Kubrick had been given a copy of the Mike Zwerin book Swing Under the Nazis after he had finished production on Full Metal Jacket, the front cover of which featured a photograph of Schulz-Koehn. A screenplay was never completed and Kubrick\\'s film adaptation plan was never initiated. The unfinished Aryan Papers, based on Louis Begley\\'s debut novel Wartime Lies, was a factor in the abandonment of the project. Work on Aryan Papers depressed Kubrick enormously, and he eventually decided that Steven Spielberg\\'s Schindler\\'s List (1993) covered much of the same material.According to biographer John Baxter, Kubrick had shown an interest in directing a pornographic film based on a satirical novel written by Terry Southern, titled Blue Movie, about a director who makes Hollywood\\'s first big-budget porn film. Baxter claims that Kubrick concluded that he did not have the patience or temperament to become involved in the porn industry, and Southern stated that Kubrick was \"too ultra conservative\" towards sexuality to have gone ahead with it, but liked the idea. Kubrick was unable to direct a film of Umberto Eco\\'s Foucault\\'s Pendulum as Eco had given his publisher instructions to never sell the film rights to any of his books after his dissatisfaction with the film version of The Name of the Rose. Also, when the film rights to Tolkien\\'s The Lord of the Rings were sold to United Artists, the Beatles approached Kubrick to direct them in a film based on the books, but Kubrick was unwilling to produce a film based on a very popular book. Director Peter Jackson has reported that Tolkien was against the involvement of the Beatles.\\n\\nCareer influences\\nAnyone who has ever been privileged to direct a film knows that, although it can be like trying to write War and Peace in a bumper car at an amusement park, when you finally get it right, there are not many joys in life that can equal the feeling.\\nAs a young man, Kubrick was fascinated by the films of Soviet filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. Kubrick read Pudovkin\\'s seminal theoretical work, Film Technique, which argues that editing makes film a unique art form, and it needs to be employed to manipulate the medium to its fullest. Kubrick recommended this work to others for many years. Thomas Nelson describes this book as \"the greatest influence of any single written work on the evolution of [Kubrick\\'s] private aesthetics\". Kubrick also found the ideas of Konstantin Stanislavski to be essential to his understanding the basics of directing, and gave himself a crash course to learn his methods.Kubrick\\'s family and many critics felt that his Jewish ancestry may have contributed to his worldview and aspects of his films. After his death, both his daughter and wife stated that he was not religious, but \"did not deny his Jewishness, not at all\". His daughter noted that he wanted to make a film about the Holocaust, the Aryan Papers, having spent years researching the subject. Most of Kubrick\\'s friends and early photography and film collaborators were Jewish, and his first two marriages were to daughters of recent Jewish immigrants from Europe. British screenwriter Frederic Raphael, who worked closely with Kubrick in his final years, believes that the originality of Kubrick\\'s films was partly because he \"had a (Jewish?) respect for scholars\". He declared that it was \"absurd to try to understand Stanley Kubrick without reckoning on Jewishness as a fundamental aspect of his mentality\".\\n\\nWalker notes that Kubrick was influenced by the tracking and \"fluid camera\" styles of director Max Ophüls, and used them in many of his films, including Paths of Glory and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Kubrick noted how in Ophuls\\' films \"the camera went through every wall and every floor\". He once named Ophüls\\' Le Plaisir (1952) as his favorite film. According to film historian John Wakeman, Ophüls himself learned the technique from director Anatole Litvak in the 1930s, when he was his assistant, and whose work was \"replete with the camera trackings, pans and swoops which later became the trademark of Max Ophüls\". Geoffrey Cocks believes that Kubrick was also influenced by Ophüls\\' stories of thwarted love and a preoccupation with predatory men, while Herr notes that Kubrick was deeply inspired by G. W. Pabst, who earlier tried, but was unable to adapt Schnitzler\\'s Traumnovelle, the basis of Eyes Wide Shut. Film critic Robert Kolker sees the influence of Welles\\' moving camera shots on Kubrick\\'s style. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick identified with Welles and that this influenced the making of The Killing, with its \"multiple points of view, extreme angles, and deep focus\".Kubrick admired the work of Ingmar Bergman and expressed it in personal letter: \"Your vision of life has moved me deeply, much more deeply than I have ever been moved by any films. I believe you are the greatest film-maker at work today [...], unsurpassed by anyone in the creation of mood and atmosphere, the subtlety of performance, the avoidance of the obvious, the truthfulness and completeness of characterization. To this one must also add everything else that goes into the making of a film; [...] and I shall look forward with eagerness to each of your films.\" \\nWhen the American magazine Cinema asked Kubrick in 1963 to name his favorite films, he listed Italian director Federico Fellini\\'s I Vitelloni as number one in his Top 10 list.\\n\\nDirecting techniques\\nPhilosophy\\nKubrick\\'s films typically involve expressions of an inner struggle, examined from different perspectives.\\nHe was very careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and to leave them open to interpretation. He explained in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna:\\n\\n\"One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture\\'s finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, \\'Now, what is it that you were trying to say in that picture?\\' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, \\'I meant what I said.\\' If I could have said it any differently, I would have\".\\nKubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can be appreciated both by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual, because their \"emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects\". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction experienced by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a 1975 Time magazine interview, Kubrick further stated: \"The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves.\" He also said: \"Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious\".\\n\\nDiane Johnson, who co-wrote the screenplay for The Shining with Kubrick, notes that he \"always said that it was better to adapt a book rather than write an original screenplay, and that you should choose a work that isn\\'t a masterpiece so you can improve on it. Which is what he\\'s always done, except with Lolita\". When deciding on a subject for a film, there were many aspects that he looked for, and he always made films which would \"appeal to every sort of viewer, whatever their expectation of film\". According to his co-producer Jan Harlan, Kubrick mostly \"wanted to make films about things that mattered, that not only had form, but substance\". Kubrick believed that audiences quite often were attracted to \"enigmas and allegories\" and did not like films in which everything was spelled out clearly.Sexuality in Kubrick\\'s films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations. Baxter states that Kubrick explores the \"furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: voyeurism, domination, bondage and rape\" in his films. He further points out that films like A Clockwork Orange are \"powerfully homoerotic\", from Alex walking about his parents\\' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being \"made up with doll-like false eyelashes\", to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid (Aubrey Morris). British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick\\'s films appear to be \"preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil\", and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as \"black as coal\", questioning his outlook on humanity. A few of his pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as Lolita and Dr. Strangelove; many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining \"the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us\". Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost \"obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one\".\\nKubrick stated that \"there is no deliberate pattern to the stories that I have chosen to make into films. About the only factor at work each time is that I try not to repeat myself\". As a result, Kubrick was often misunderstood by critics, and only once did he have unanimously positive reviews upon the release of a film—for Paths of Glory.\\n\\nWriting and staging scenes\\nFilm author Patrick Webster considers Kubrick\\'s methods of writing and developing scenes to fit with the classical auteur theory of directing, allowing collaboration and improvisation with the actors during filming. Malcolm McDowell recalled Kubrick\\'s collaborative emphasis during their discussions and his willingness to allow him to improvise a scene, stating that \"there was a script and we followed it, but when it didn\\'t work he knew it, and we had to keep rehearsing endlessly until we were bored with it\".\\nOnce Kubrick was confident in the overall staging of a scene, and felt the actors were prepared, he would then develop the visual aspects, including camera and lighting placement. Walker believes that Kubrick was one of \"very few film directors competent to instruct their lighting photographers in the precise effect they want\". Baxter believes that Kubrick was heavily influenced by his ancestry and always possessed a European perspective to filmmaking, particularly the Austro-Hungarian empire and his admiration for Max Ophuls and Richard Strauss.Gilbert Adair, writing in a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that \"Kubrick\\'s approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression\". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a \"visual filmmaker\", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it \"more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals\" as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: \"I think you have to view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it\\'s only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing\". Kubrick also said: \"I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience\\'s skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don\\'t have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools.\"\\n\\nDirecting\\nKubrick was notorious for demanding multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman explains that the large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a \"deeper place\". Kubrick\\'s high take ratio was considered by some critics as \"irrational\"; he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: \"Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try\" ...\"When you make a movie, it takes a few days just to get used to the crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you\\'re accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself\". He also told biographer Michel Ciment: \"It\\'s invariably because the actors don\\'t know their lines, or don\\'t know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he\\'s thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I\\'m not sure that the early takes aren\\'t just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera.\"Kubrick would devote his personal breaks to having lengthy discussions with actors. Among those who valued his attention was Tony Curtis, star of Spartacus, who said Kubrick was his favorite director, adding, \"his greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors.\" He further added, \"Kubrick had his own approach to film-making. He wanted to see the actor\\'s faces. He didn\\'t want cameras always in a wide shot twenty-five feet away, he wanted close-ups, he wanted to keep the camera moving. That was his style.\" Similarly, Malcolm McDowell recalls the long discussions he had with Kubrick to help him develop his character in A Clockwork Orange, noting that on set he felt entirely uninhibited and free, which is what made Kubrick \"such a great director\". Kubrick also allowed actors at times to improvise and to \"break the rules\", particularly with Peter Sellers in Lolita, which became a turning point in his career as it allowed him to work creatively during the shooting, as opposed to the preproduction stage.\\nDuring an interview, Ryan O\\'Neal recalled Kubrick\\'s directing style: \"God, he works you hard. He moves you, pushes you, helps you, gets cross with you, but above all he teaches you the value of a good director. Stanley brought out aspects of my personality and acting instincts that had been dormant ... My strong suspicion [was] that I was involved in something great\". He further added that working with Kubrick was \"a stunning experience\" and that he never recovered from working with somebody of such magnificence.\\n\\nCinematography\\nKubrick credited the ease with which he filmed scenes to his early years as a photographer. He rarely added camera instructions in the script, preferring to handle that after a scene is created, as the visual part of film-making came easiest to him. Even in deciding which props and settings would be used, Kubrick paid meticulous attention to detail and tried to collect as much background material as possible, functioning rather like what he described as \"a detective\". Cinematographer John Alcott, who worked closely with Kubrick on four of his films, and won an Oscar for Best Cinematography on Barry Lyndon, remarked that Kubrick \"questions everything\", and was involved in the technical aspects of film-making including camera placement, scene composition, choice of lens, and even operating the camera which would usually be left to the cinematographer. Alcott considered Kubrick to be the \"nearest thing to genius I\\'ve ever worked with, with all the problems of a genius\".\\n\\nAmong Kubrick\\'s innovations in cinematography are his use of special effects, as in 2001, where he used both slit-scan photography and front-screen projection, which won Kubrick his only Oscar for special effects. Some reviewers have described and illustrated with video clips, Kubrick\\'s use of \"one-point perspective\", which leads the viewer\\'s eye towards a central vanishing point. The technique relies on creating a complex visual symmetry using parallel lines in a scene which all converge on that single point, leading away from the viewer. Combined with camera motion it could produce an effect that one writer describes as \"hypnotic and thrilling\". The Shining was among the first half-dozen features to use the then-revolutionary Steadicam (after the 1976 films Bound for Glory, Marathon Man and Rocky). Kubrick used it to its fullest potential, which gave the audience smooth, stabilized, motion-tracking by the camera. Kubrick described Steadicam as being like a \"magic carpet\", allowing \"fast, flowing, camera movements\" in the maze in The Shining which otherwise would have been impossible.Kubrick was among the first directors to use video assist during filming. At the time he began using it in 1966, it was considered cutting-edge technology, requiring him to build his own system. Having it in place during the filming of 2001, he was able to view a video of a take immediately after it was filmed. On some films, such as Barry Lyndon, he used custom made zoom lenses, which allowed him to start a scene with a close-up and slowly zoom out to capture the full panorama of scenery and to film long takes under changing outdoor lighting conditions by making aperture adjustments while the cameras rolled. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick\\'s technical knowledge about lenses \"dazzled the manufacturer\\'s engineers, who found him to be unprecedented among contemporary filmmakers\". For Barry Lyndon he also used a specially adapted high-speed (f/0.7) Zeiss camera lens, originally developed for NASA, to shoot numerous scenes lit only with candlelight. Actor Steven Berkoff recalls that Kubrick wanted scenes to be shot using \"pure candlelight\", and in doing so Kubrick \"made a unique contribution to the art of filmmaking going back to painting ... You almost posed like for portraits.\" LoBrutto notes that cinematographers all over the world wanted to know about Kubrick\\'s \"magic lens\" and that he became a \"legend\" among cameramen around the world.\\n\\nEditing and music\\nKubrick spent extensive hours editing, often working seven days a week, and more hours a day as he got closer to deadlines. For Kubrick, written dialogue was one element to be put in balance with mise en scène (set arrangements), music, and especially, editing. Inspired by Pudovkin\\'s treatise on film editing, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often \"re-direct\" a film, and he remarked: \"I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of filmmaking ... Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art form—a point so important it cannot be overstressed ... It can make or break a film\". Biographer John Baxter stated that \"Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line. Then over months ... he arranged and rearranged the tens of thousands of scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing\".Kubrick\\'s attention to music was an aspect of what many referred to as his \"perfectionism\" and extreme attention to minute details, which his wife Christiane attributed to an addiction to music. In his last six films, Kubrick usually chose music from existing sources, especially classical compositions. He preferred selecting recorded music over having it composed for a film, believing that no hired composer could do as well as the public domain classical composers. He also felt that building scenes from great music often created the \"most memorable scenes\" in the best films. In one instance, for a scene in Barry Lyndon which was written into the screenplay as merely, \"Barry duels with Lord Bullingdon\", he spent forty-two working days in the editing phase. During that period, he listened to what LoBrutto describes as \"every available recording of seventeenth-and eighteenth- century music, acquiring thousands of records to find Handel\\'s sarabande used to score the scene\". Jack Nicholson likewise observed his attention to music for his films, stating that Kubrick \"listened constantly to music until he discovered something he felt was right or that excited him\".Kubrick is credited with introducing Hungarian composer György Ligeti to a broad Western audience by including his music in 2001, The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut. According to Baxter, the music in 2001 was \"at the forefront of Kubrick\\'s mind\" when he conceived the film. During earlier screening he played music by Mendelssohn and Vaughan Williams, and Kubrick and writer Clarke had listened to Carl Orff\\'s transcription of Carmina Burana, consisting of 13th century sacred and secular songs. Ligeti\\'s music employed the new style of micropolyphony, which used sustained dissonant chords that shift slowly over time, a style he originated. Its inclusion in the film became a \"boon for the relatively unknown composer\" partly because it was introduced alongside background by Johann Strauss and Richard Strauss.In addition to Ligeti, Kubrick also enjoyed a collaboration with composer Wendy Carlos, whose 1968 album Switched-On Bach—which re-interpreted baroque music through the use of a Moog synthesizer—caught his attention. In 1971, Carlos composed and recorded music for the soundtrack of A Clockwork Orange. Additional music not used in the film was released in 1972 as Wendy Carlos\\'s Clockwork Orange. Kubrick later collaborated with Carlos on The Shining (1980). The opening of the film, in which the camera follows Jack Torrance\\'s yellow VW beetle through the mountains to the Overlook Hotel, employs Carlos\\' eerie rendering of \"Dies Irae\" (Day of Wrath) from Hector Berlioz\\'s Symphonie Fantastique.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nKubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz, a caricaturist, on May 29, 1948, when he was nineteen years old. They had attended Taft High School together and had lived in the same apartment block on Shakespeare Avenue. The couple lived together in Greenwich Village and divorced three years later in 1951. He met his second wife, the Austrian-born dancer and theatrical designer Ruth Sobotka, in 1952. They lived together in New York City\\'s East Village beginning in 1952, married in January 1955, and moved to Hollywood in July 1955, where she played a brief part as a ballet dancer in Kubrick\\'s film, Killer\\'s Kiss (1955). The following year she was art director for his film, The Killing (1956). They divorced in 1957.During the production of Paths of Glory in Munich in early 1957, Kubrick met and romanced the German actress Christiane Harlan, who played a small though memorable role in the film. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and the couple remained together for 40 years, until his death in 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together: Anya Renata (April 6, 1959 – July 7, 2009) and Vivian Vanessa (born August 5, 1960). In 1959 they settled into a home at 316 South Camden Drive in Beverly Hills with Harlan\\'s daughter, Katherina, aged six. They also lived in New York City, during which time Christiane studied art at the Art Students League of New York, later becoming an independent artist. The couple moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 to make Lolita, and Kubrick hired Peter Sellers to star in his next film, Dr. Strangelove. Sellers was unable to leave the UK, so Kubrick made Britain his permanent home thereafter. The move was quite convenient to Kubrick, since he shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine, and he and Christiane had become alarmed with the increase in violence in New York City.\\n\\nIn 1965 the Kubricks bought Abbots Mead on Barnet Lane, just south-west of the Elstree/Borehamwood studio complex in England. Kubrick worked almost exclusively from this home for 14 years where, with some exceptions, he researched, invented special effects techniques, designed ultra-low light lenses for specially modified cameras, pre-produced, edited, post-produced, advertised, distributed and carefully managed all aspects of four of his films. In 1978, Kubrick moved into Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, a mainly 18th-century stately home, which was once owned by a wealthy racehorse owner, about 30 mi (50 km) north of London and a 10-minute drive from his previous home at Abbotts Mead. His new home became a workplace for Kubrick and his wife, \"a perfect family factory\" as Christiane called it, and Kubrick converted the stables into extra production rooms besides ones within the home that he used for editing and storage.A workaholic, Kubrick rarely took a vacation or left England during the forty years before his death. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick\\'s confined way of living and desire for privacy has led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, similar to those of Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, and J. D. Salinger. Michael Herr, Kubrick\\'s co-screenwriter on Full Metal Jacket, who knew him well, considers his \"reclusiveness\" to be myth: \"[He] was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless you believe that a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house. Stanley saw a lot of people ... he was one of the most gregarious men I ever knew, and it didn\\'t change anything that most of this conviviality went on over the phone.\"  LoBrutto states that one of the reasons he acquired a reputation as a recluse was that he insisted in remaining near his home, but the reason for this was that for Kubrick there were only three places on the planet he could make high quality films with the necessary technical expertise and equipment: Los Angeles, New York City or around London. He disliked living in Los Angeles, and thought London a superior film production center to New York City.As a person, Kubrick was described by Norman Lloyd as \"a very dark, sort of a glowering type who was very serious\". Marisa Berenson, who starred in Barry Lyndon, fondly recalled: \"There was great tenderness in him and he was passionate about his work. What was striking was his enormous intelligence, but he also had a great sense of humor. He was a very shy person and self-protective, but he was filled with the thing that drove him twenty-four hours of the day.\" Kubrick was particularly fond of machines and technical equipment, to the point that his wife Christiane once stated that \"Stanley would be happy with eight tape recorders and one pair of pants\". Kubrick had obtained a pilot\\'s license in August 1947; some have claimed that he later developed a fear of flying, stemming from an incident in the early 1950s when a colleague had been killed in a plane crash. Kubrick had been sent the charred remains of his camera and notebooks which, according to Duncan, traumatized him for life. Kubrick also had a strong mistrust of doctors and medicine, especially those he did not know, and on one occasion he had a dentist from the Bronx flown to London to treat him.\\n\\nDeath\\nOn March 7, 1999, six days after screening a final cut of Eyes Wide Shut for his family and the stars, Kubrick died in his sleep at the age of 70, suffering a heart attack. His funeral was held five days later at his home estate at Childwickbury Manor, with only close friends and family in attendance, totaling approximately 100 people. The media were kept a mile away outside the entrance gate. Alexander Walker, who attended the funeral, described it as a \"family farewell, ... almost like an English picnic\", with cellists, clarinetists and singers providing song and music from many of his favorite classical compositions. Kaddish, the Jewish prayer typically said by mourners and in other contexts, was recited. A few of his obituaries mentioned his Jewish background. Among those who gave eulogies were Terry Semel, Jan Harlan, Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. He was buried next to his favorite tree on the estate. In her book dedicated to Kubrick, his wife Christiane included one of his favorite quotations of Oscar Wilde: \"The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young.\"\\n\\nLegacy\\nCultural impact\\nPart of the New Hollywood film-making wave, Kubrick\\'s films are considered by film historian Michel Ciment to be \"among the most important contributions to world cinema in the twentieth century\", and he is frequently cited as one of the greatest and most influential directors in the history of cinema. Leading directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Wes Anderson, George Lucas, James Cameron, Terry Gilliam, the Coen brothers, Ridley Scott, and George A. Romero, have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration, and additionally in the case of Spielberg and Scott, collaboration. On the DVD of Eyes Wide Shut, Steven Spielberg comments that the way Kubrick \"tells a story is antithetical to the way we are accustomed to receiving stories\" and that \"nobody could shoot a picture better in history\". Orson Welles, one of Kubrick\\'s greatest personal influences and all-time favorite directors, said that: \"Among those whom I would call \\'younger generation\\', Kubrick appears to me to be a giant.\" Akira Kurosawa, another director Kubrick admired, remarked, \"He made many masterpieces.\"Kubrick continues to be cited as a major influence by many directors, including Christopher Nolan, Todd Field, David Fincher, Guillermo del Toro, David Lynch, Lars von Trier, Tim Burton, Michael Mann, and Gaspar Noé. Many filmmakers imitate Kubrick\\'s inventive and unique use of camera movement and framing, as well as his use of music, including Frank Darabont. Paul Thomas Anderson, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, stated, \"it\\'s so hard to do anything that doesn\\'t owe some kind of debt to what Stanley Kubrick did with music in movies. Inevitably, you\\'re going to end up doing something that he\\'s probably already done before. It can all seem like we\\'re falling behind whatever he came up with.\"Artists in fields other than film have also expressed admiration for Kubrick. English musician and poet PJ Harvey, in an interview about her 2011 album Let England Shake, argued that \"something about [...] what is not said in his films...there\\'s so much space, so many things that are silent – and somehow, in that space and silence everything becomes clear. With every film, he seems to capture the essence of life itself, particularly in films like Paths of Glory, [2001: A Space Odyssey], Barry Lyndon...those are some of my favorites.\" The music video for Kanye West\\'s 2010 song \"Runaway\" was inspired by Eyes Wide Shut. Pop singer Lady Gaga\\'s concert shows have included the use of dialogue, costumes, and music from A Clockwork Orange.\\n\\nTributes\\nIn 2000, BAFTA renamed their Britannia lifetime achievement award the \"Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award\", joining the likes of D. W. Griffith, Laurence Olivier, Cecil B. DeMille, and Irving Thalberg, all of whom have annual awards named after them. Kubrick won this award in 1999, and subsequent recipients have included George Lucas, Warren Beatty, Tom Cruise, Robert De Niro, Clint Eastwood, and Daniel Day-Lewis. Many people who worked with Kubrick on his films created the 2001 documentary Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures, produced and directed by Kubrick\\'s brother-in-law, Jan Harlan, who had executive produced Kubrick\\'s last four films.The first public exhibition of material from Kubrick\\'s personal archives was presented jointly in 2004 by the Deutsches Filmmuseum and Deutsches Architekturmuseum in Frankfurt, Germany, in cooperation with Christiane Kubrick and Jan Harlan / The Stanley Kubrick Estate. In 2009, an exhibition of paintings and photos inspired by Kubrick\\'s films was held in Dublin, Ireland, entitled \"Stanley Kubrick: Taming Light\". On October 30, 2012, an exhibition devoted to Kubrick opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and concluded in June 2013. Exhibits include a wide collection of documents, photographs and on-set material assembled from 800 boxes of personal archives that were stored in Kubrick\\'s home-workplace in the UK. Many celebrities attended and spoke at the museum\\'s pre-opening gala, including Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Jack Nicholson, while Kubrick\\'s widow, Christiane, appeared at the pre-gala press review. In October 2013, the Brazil São Paulo International Film Festival paid tribute to Kubrick, staging an exhibit of his work and a retrospective of his films. The exhibit opened at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in late 2014 and ended in January 2015.Kubrick is widely referenced in popular culture, and the TV series The Simpsons is said to contain more references to Kubrick films than any other pop culture phenomenon. When the Directors Guild of Great Britain gave Kubrick a lifetime achievement award, they included a cut-together sequence of all the homages from the show. Several works have been created that related to Kubrick\\'s life, including the made-for-TV mockumentary Dark Side of the Moon (2002), which is a parody of the pervasive conspiracy theory that Kubrick had been involved with the faked footage of the NASA moon landings during the filming of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Colour Me Kubrick (2005) was authorized by Kubrick\\'s family and starred John Malkovich as Alan Conway, a con artist who had assumed Kubrick\\'s identity in the 1990s. In the 2004 film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, Kubrick was portrayed by Stanley Tucci; the film documents the filming of Dr. Strangelove.In April 2018, the month that marked the 50th anniversary of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the International Astronomical Union named the largest mountain of Pluto\\'s moon Charon after Kubrick.From October 2019 through the beginning of March 2020, the Skirball Cultural Center hosted an exhibition called Through a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs, a show focusing on Kubrick\\'s early career.\\n\\nSee also\\nHawk Films\\nStanley Kubrick Archive\\nStanley Kubrick bibliography\\nStanley Kubrick\\'s Boxes\\nStanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures\\nFilmworker, a documentary with Leon Vitali about his work with Kubrick\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nSources\\nExternal links\\nStanley Kubrick at IMDb\\nStanley Kubrick Collection\\nStanley Kubrick at the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame\\nThe Films of Stanley Kubrick on YouTube, movie clip compilation, 4 minutes',\n",

              " 'Steven Spielberg': 'Steven Allan Spielberg (; born December 18, 1946) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. He began his career in the New Hollywood era, and is one of the most commercially successful directors in history. Spielberg is the recipient of various accolades, including two Academy Awards for Best Director, a Kennedy Center honor, and a Cecil B. DeMille Award.\\nSpielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He later moved to California and studied film in college. After directing television episodes and several minor films for Universal Studios, he became a household name for directing 1975\\'s summer blockbuster Jaws. He then directed box office hits Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and the adventure films in the Indiana Jones series. Spielberg later explored drama in The Color Purple (1985), and Empire of the Sun (1987).\\nAfter a brief setback, the director returned with the acclaimed Jurassic Park and Schindler\\'s List (both 1993). In 1998, he directed the World War II epic Saving Private Ryan, which was both a critical and commercial success. Spielberg continued in the 2000s with science fiction, including Artificial Intelligence (2001) and Minority Report (2002). He made a comeback with several children\\'s films, and historical dramas such as Lincoln (2012) and The Post (2017).\\nIn addition to filmmaking, he co-founded Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks, and has served as a producer for many television series and films. Spielberg is also known for his long time collaboration with composer John Williams, with whom he has worked for all but five of his feature films. Some of his works are among the highest-grossing films of all time, and seven have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\\n\\nEarly life and background\\nSteven Allan Spielberg was born on December 18, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother, Leah (née Posner, later Adler; January 12, 1920 – February 21, 2017), was a restaurateur and concert pianist, and his father, Arnold Spielberg (February 6, 1917 – August 25, 2020), was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers. His family were Orthodox Jewish. Spielberg\\'s paternal grandparents were Jews from Ukraine, who settled in Cincinnati in the 1900s; his grandmother was from Sudylkiv, and his grandfather was from Kamianets-Podilskyi. Spielberg has three younger sisters: Anne, Sue and Nancy. In 1952, his family moved to Haddon Township, New Jersey after his father was hired by RCA. Spielberg attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957, in classes taught by Rabbi Albert L. Lewis.In early 1957, the family moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Spielberg had a bar mitzvah ceremony when he was thirteen. His family was involved in the synagogue and had many Jewish friends. Of the Holocaust, he said that his parents \"talked about it all the time, and so it was always on my mind.\" His father had lost between sixteen and twenty relatives in the Holocaust. Spielberg found it difficult accepting his heritage; he said: \"It isn\\'t something I enjoy admitting [...] but when I was seven, eight, nine years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parents\\' Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times.\" Spielberg also suffered from anti-Semitism: \"In high school, I got smacked and kicked around. Two bloody noses. It was horrible.\" He grew away from Judaism during adolescence, after his family had moved to various neighborhoods and found themselves to be the only Jews.At age 12, he made his first home movie: a train wreck involving his toy Lionel trains. In 1958, he became a Boy Scout and fulfilled a requirement for the photography merit badge by making a nine-minute, 8 mm film titled The Last Gunfight. He eventually attained the rank of Eagle Scout. Spielberg used his father\\'s movie camera to make amateur features, and began taking the camera along on every Scout trip. At age 13, Spielberg made a 40-minute war film, titled Escape to Nowhere, with a cast of school classmates. The film won first prize in a statewide competition. Throughout his early teens, and after entering high school, Spielberg made about fifteen or twenty 8 mm \"adventure\" films.In Phoenix, Spielberg watched films at the local theatre every Saturday. Some of the films he cited as early influences include King of the Monsters (1956), Captains Courageous (1937), Pinocchio (1940), and Lawrence of Arabia (1962), which he cited as \"the film that set me on my journey\". He attended Arcadia High School in 1961 for three years. He wrote and directed his first independent film in 1963, a 140-minute science fiction adventure called Firelight, which would later inspire Close Encounters of The Third Kind. The film was mainly funded by his father, which had a budget of under $600, and was shown in a local theatre for one evening. In the summer of 1964, he worked as an unpaid assistant at Universal Studios\\' editorial department. His family later moved to Saratoga, California where he attended Saratoga High School, graduating in 1965. A year later, his parents divorced. Spielberg moved to Los Angeles to stay with his father, while his three sisters and mother remained in Saratoga. He was not interested in academics; he aspired to be only a filmmaker. He applied to the University of Southern California\\'s film school but was turned down because of his mediocre grades. He then applied and enrolled at California State University, Long Beach, where he became a brother of Theta Chi Fraternity.In 1968, Universal gave Spielberg the opportunity to write and direct a short film for theatrical release, the 26-minute, 35 mm Amblin\\'. Studio vice-president Sidney Sheinberg was impressed by the award-winning film, and offered Spielberg a seven-year directing contract. A year later, he dropped out of college to begin directing television productions for Universal. It made him the youngest director to be signed a long-term plan with a major Hollywood studio. Spielberg returned to Long Beach in 2002 to complete his Bachelor of Arts in Film and Electronic Media.\\n\\nCareer\\n1969–1974: Entering film and television\\nSpielberg\\'s first professional job came when he was hired to direct one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of Night Gallery, written by Rod Serling and starring Joan Crawford. Crawford was \"speechless, and then horrified\" at the thought of a young and inexperienced newcomer directing her. Spielberg attempted to impress his colleagues with fancy camerawork, but executives ordered him to shoot it quickly. His contributions were not well received, thus Spielberg took a short break from the studio. However, Crawford said of the director:\\n\\nWhen I began to work with Steven, I understood everything. It was immediately obvious to me, and probably everyone else, that here was a young genius. I thought maybe more experience was important, but then I thought of all of those experienced directors who didn\\'t have Steven\\'s intuitive inspiration and who just kept repeating the same old routine performances. That was called \"experience.\" I knew then that Steven Spielberg had a brilliant future ahead of him. Hollywood doesn\\'t always recognize talent, but Steven\\'s was not going to be overlooked. I told him so in a note I wrote him. I wrote to Rod Serling, too. I was so grateful that he had approved Steven as the director. I told him he had been totally right.\\nIn the early 1970s, Spielberg unsuccessfully tried to raise finance for his own low-budget films. He turned to writing screenplays with other writers, and then directing television episodes. These included the series: Marcus Welby, M.D., The Name of the Game  (\"L.A. 2017\"), Columbo, Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law and The Psychiatrist. Although unsatisfied with this work, Spielberg used the opportunity to experiment with his techniques and learn about filmmaking. The director earned good reviews and impressed producers; he was earning a steady income and relocated to Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles.\\nBased on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four television films. The first was Duel (1971), adapted from Richard Matheson\\'s short story of the same title. It is about a psychotic tanker truck driver who chases a terrified salesman (Dennis Weaver) down a highway. Impressed with the film, executives decided to promote the film on television. Reviews were mainly positive, and Universal asked Spielberg to shoot more scenes so that Duel could be released to international markets. Several films followed soon after: Something Evil (1972), and Savage (1973). Both features gained mixed reviews.\\nIn 1974, Spielberg made his debut in a theatrical film, The Sugarland Express, about a married couple on the run, desperate to regain custody of their baby from foster parents. Based on a true story, the film would mark the first of many collaborations with composer John Williams; the director was impressed with his previous soundtracks. The film opened to four hundred theatres in the U.S. to positive reviews, and The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \"a major new director is on the horizon.\" Although the film was honored for Best Screenplay at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, it was not commercial success. Spielberg blamed Universal\\'s inconsistent marketing for its poor box office results.\\n\\n1975–1983: Film breakthrough\\nProducers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown took a chance with Spielberg, and gave him the opportunity to direct Jaws (1975), a horror-thriller based on the Peter Benchley novel of the same title. In the film, a great white shark attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town, prompting police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss). Filming proved to be challenging; Spielberg almost drowned and escaped being crushed from boats. The filming schedule overran by a hundred days, and Universal also threatened to cancel production. Against expectations, the film was a critical success; Jaws won three Academy Awards, in Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound, and grossed more than $470 million worldwide. It also set the domestic box office record, leading to what the press described as \"Jawsmania\", and making Spielberg a household name. After watching the unconventional, off-center camera techniques of Jaws, Alfred Hitchcock praised \"young Spielberg\", for thinking outside of the visual dynamics of the theater, saying \"He\\'s the first one of us who doesn\\'t see the proscenium arch\".After the success of Jaws, the director turned down an offer to make its sequel, Jaws 2. Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about UFOs: Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). During filming, Spielberg used 65 mm film for the best picture quality, and a new live-action recording system so that the recordings could be duplicated later. One of the rare films both written and directed by himself, Close Encounters was very popular with film-goers, and Spielberg received his first Best Director nomination from the Academy Awards. It also earned six more nominations, winning Best Cinematography, and Best Sound Effects Editing. A Special Edition version of the film, featuring both shortened and newly added scenes, was released theatrically in 1980.\\nHis next film was 1979\\'s big-budget action-comedy 1941, about Californians preparing for a Japanese invasion after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Spielberg was conscious about doing comedy as he had no prior experience in it, however, he was keen on tackling a lighthearted genre. Universal and Columbia agreed to co-finance the film. Upon release, it grossed over $92.4 million worldwide, but most critics including the studio heads disliked the film. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Champlin described 1941 as \"the most conspicuous waste since the last major oil spill, which it somewhat resembles\". Another critic wrote \"1941 isn\\'t simply a silly slur against any particular race, sex, or generation—it makes war against all humanity.\"\\nNext, Spielberg collaborated with Star Wars creator  George Lucas on an action adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), the first film in the Indiana Jones franchise. The title character was played by Harrison Ford (whom Lucas had previously cast in his Star Wars films as Han Solo). Ford was Spielberg\\'s first choice for the role. Filmed in North Africa, the shoot was difficult but Spielberg said that the experience helped him with his business acumen. The film was a successful at the box office, and won five Academy Awards; Spielberg received his second nomination for Best Director, and Best Picture. Raiders of the Lost Ark was considered by Spielberg and Lucas as a homage to the serials of the 1930s and 1940s. Spielberg started to co-produce films, including 1982\\'s Poltergeist, and directed the segment \"Kick The Can\" in The Twilight Zone. In a previous segment, Vic Morrow and two child actors were killed in a stunt helicopter crash. Spielberg was not directing or present during the incident, and was cleared of any wrongdoing by the National Transportation Safety Board.A year later, Spielberg returned to science fiction with E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). It is the story of a young boy (Henry Thomas) and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. Spielberg shot the film mostly in sequence to keep the children spontaneous towards the climax. E.T. premiered at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival to an ecstatic reaction; producer Kathleen Kennedy recalled, \"You couldn\\'t hear the end of the movie because people were on their feet stomping and yelling [...] It was one of the most amazing experiences.\" A special screening was organized for President Reagan and his wife Nancy, who were emotional by the end of the film. E.T. grossed $700 million worldwide, and spawned a range of merchandise which would eventually earn up to $1 billion. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning Best Sound Effects, Best Special Effects, and Best Music.His next directorial feature was the Raiders of the Lost Ark prequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). Working once again with George Lucas and Harrison Ford, the film was shot in the United States, Sri Lanka and China. This film and Gremlins led to the creation of the PG-13 rating because some of the material was not suitable for children under 13. Temple of Doom was rated PG-13 by the MPAA; some scenes depicted children working in the mines. The director later said that he was unhappy with the Temple of Doom because it did not have his \"personal touches and love\". Nonetheless, the film was a blockbuster hit, and won an Academy Award for Best Special Effects. It was on this project that Spielberg also met his future wife, actress Kate Capshaw, who played Willie Scott in the film.\\n\\n1984–1990: From producing to directing\\nIn 1984, Spielberg, Frank Marshall, and Kathleen Kennedy founded production company Amblin Entertainment. Between 1984 and 1990, Spielberg served as either producer or executive producer on nineteen feature films; these include:The Goonies, The Money Pit, Joe Versus the Volcano, *batteries not included, Back to the Future, Cape Fear, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. In some films, such as Harry and the Hendersons and Young Sherlock Holmes, the title \"Steven Spielberg Presents\" would be shown in the opening credits. Much of Spielberg\\'s producing work was aimed at children and teens, including cartoons such as Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, and Freakazoid!, and Family Dog. Spielberg also produced the Don Bluth animations, An American Tail and The Land Before Time.Beginning in 1985, NBC offered Spielberg a two-year contract on a television series, Amazing Stories; the show was marketed as a blend of The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. NBC gave the director complete creative control, and a budget of $1 million for each episode. After two seasons and disappointing ratings, the show was not renewed. Although Spielberg\\'s involvement as a producer would vary widely from project to project, director Robert Zemeckis said that Spielberg would always \"respect the filmmaker\\'s vision\". Over the years, Spielberg\\'s record as a producer brought mixed critical and commercial performance. In 1992, Spielberg began to scale back producing, saying \"Producing has been the least fulfilling aspect of what I\\'ve done in the last decade.\" In 1994, he found success for producing the successful medical drama ER.In the early 1980s, Spielberg befriended WarnerMedia CEO Steve Ross, which eventually resulted in the director making films for Warner Bros. In 1985, Spielberg directed The Color Purple, an adaptation of Alice Walker\\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same title, about a generation of empowered African-American women during depression-era America. It was the director\\'s first film on a serious topic; he expressed reservations about tackling the project: \"It\\'s the risk of being judged-and accused of not having the sensibility to do character studies.\" Starring Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, the film was a box office hit and critics started to take Spielberg\\'s foray into the dramatic genre seriously. Roger Ebert rated it as the best film of the year. The film also received eleven Academy Award nominations, and Spielberg won Best Director from the Director\\'s Guild of America.As China underwent economic reform and opened up to the American film industry, Spielberg managed to shoot the first American film in Shanghai since the 1930s. Empire of the Sun (1987), an adaptation of J. G. Ballard\\'s autobiographical novel of the same title, starred John Malkovich and a young Christian Bale. The film tells the story of Jamie Graham (Bale), a young boy who goes from living in a wealthy British family in Shanghai, to becoming a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp during World War II. Critical consensus was mixed at the time of release; criticism ranged from the \"overwrought\" plot, to Spielberg\\'s downplaying of \"disease and starvation\". However, critic Andrew Sarris called it the best film of the year and later included it among the best of the decade. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, but was a commercial disappointment at the box office. The New York Times thought it was overlooked by audiences; Spielberg recalled that Empire of the Sun was one of his most enjoyable films to make.After those two serious films, Spielberg intended to direct the comedy Rain Man, but instead directed the third Indiana Jones film to meet his contractual obligations: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Producer George Lucas, and Harrison Ford returned for the film. Spielberg cast Sean Connery in a supporting role as Henry Jones, Sr. As a result of the mixed reaction to 1984\\'s Temple of Doom, the director toned down the darkness and violence in the third installment. Last Crusade gained mostly respectful reviews and was a box office success, earning $474 million; it was his biggest hit since 1982\\'s E.T. Biographer Joseph McBride wrote that it was a comeback for Spielberg, and the director acknowledged the amount he has learned from making all three Indiana Jones films.\\nAlso in 1989, he reunited with Richard Dreyfuss in the romantic drama Always, about a daredevil pilot who extinguishes forest fires. It is a modern remake of one of Spielberg\\'s childhood favorite films, 1943\\'s A Guy Named Joe. The story was personal to him, and he said \"As a child I was very frustrated, and maybe I saw my own parents [in A Guy Named Joe]. I was also short of girlfriends. And it stuck with me.\" Spielberg had discussed the film with Dreyfuss back in 1975, with up to twelve drafts being written before filming commenced. Always was not commercially successful and received mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of the New York Times wrote, \"Always is filled with big, sentimental moments, it lacks the intimacy to make any of this very moving.\"\\n\\n1991–1998: Critical and commercial success\\nAfter a brief setback in which the director felt \"artistically stalled\", he returned in 1991 with Hook, about a middle-aged Peter Pan, played by Robin Williams, who returns to Neverland. During filming, Williams, co-stars Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts clashed on set due to their personalities; Spielberg told the 60 Minutes program that he would never work with Roberts again. Nominated for five Academy Awards, the studio enjoyed the film but most critics did not, calling it \"bloated\". Writing for The Washington Post, Hal Hinson described the film as \"too industrially organized\", and thought it was mundane. At the box office, it earned over $300 million worldwide from a $70 million budget. In 1993, Spielberg served as an executive producer for the NBC science fiction series seaQuest DSV; the show was not a hit.In 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with Jurassic Park, based on the 1990 novel of the same title by Michael Crichton, and a screenplay by the latter and David Koepp. Jurassic Park is set on a fictional island near Costa Rica, where a team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of de-extinct dinosaurs. In a departure from his usual order of planning, Spielberg and the designers storyboarded certain sequences from the novel early on. The film also used computer-generated imagery provided by Industrial Light & Magic; Jurassic Park was completed on time and became the highest-grossing film at the time, and won three Academy Awards. The film\\'s dominance during its theatrical run, as well as Spielberg\\'s $250 million salary, caused the director to be self-conscious of his own success.\\nAlso in 1993, Spielberg directed Schindler\\'s List, about Oskar Schindler, a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust. Based on Schindler\\'s Ark by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally, Spielberg waited ten years to make the film as he did not feel \"mature\" enough. He wanted to embrace his heritage, and after the birth of his son, Max, he said that \"it greatly affected me [...] A spirit began to ignite in me, and I became a Jewish dad\". Filming commenced on March 1, 1993 in Poland, while Spielberg was still editing Jurassic Park in the evenings. To make filming \"bearable\", the director brought his wife and children with him. While Schindler\\'s List was praised by most critics, some reviewers, including filmmaker Claude Lanzmann, criticized the film for its weak representation of the Holocaust. Imre Kertész, a Hungarian author and concentration camp survivor, called Schindler\\'s List kitsch, saying \"I regard as kitsch any representation of the Holocaust that is incapable of understanding or unwilling to understand the organic connection between our own deformed mode of life and the very possibility of the Holocaust.\" Against expectations, the film was a commercial success, and Spielberg used his percentage of profits to start the Shoah Foundation, a non-profit organization that archives testimonies of Holocaust survivors. Schindler\\'s List won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and Spielberg\\'s first as Best Director. It also won seven BAFTAs, and three Golden Globes. According to the American Film Institute, Schindler\\'s List is one of the 100 best American films ever made.In 1994, Spielberg took a break from directing to spend more time with his family, and setup his new film studio, DreamWorks, with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. More creative control and distribution improvements were the main reasons why Spielberg wanted his own studio; he and his partners compared themselves to the founders of United Artists back in 1919. Investors included Microsoft founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates. After founding DreamWorks, Spielberg continued to operate Amblin Entertainment and direct films for other studios. Besides film, the director helped design a Jurassic Park-themed attraction at Universal Orlando in Florida. The workload of filmmaking and operating a studio raised questions about his commitments, but Spielberg maintained that \"this is all fitting nicely into my life and I\\'m still home by six and I\\'m still home on the weekends.\"After his break, he returned to directing with a sequel to Jurassic Park: The Lost World: Jurassic Park. A loose adaptation of Michael Crichton\\'s novel, The Lost World, the plot follows mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and his researchers who study dinosaurs at a Jurassic Park island, and are confronted by another team with a different agenda. This time, Spielberg wanted the onscreen creatures to be more realistic than in the first film; he used 3D storyboards, computer imagery and robotic puppets. Budgeted at $73 million, The Lost World: Jurassic Park opened in May 1997 and was one of the highest grossing films of the year. The Village Voice critic opined that The Lost World was \"better crafted but less fun\" that the first film, while The Guardian wrote \"It looks like a director on autopilot [...] The special effects brook no argument.\"His 1997 feature, Amistad, his first released under DreamWorks, was based on the true story of the events in 1839 aboard the slave ship La Amistad. Producer Debbie Allen, who had read the book Amistad I in 1978, thought Spielberg would be perfect to direct. Spielberg was hesitant taking on the project, afraid that it will be compared to Schindler\\'s List, but he said, \"I\\'ve never planned my career [...] In the end I do what I think I gotta do.\" Starring Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Djimon Hounsou and Matthew McConaughey, the director used Allen\\'s ten years worth of research to reenact the difficult historical scenes. The film struggled to find an audience, and underperformed at the box office; Spielberg admitted that \"[Amistad] became too much of a history lesson.\"The director\\'s 1998 release was World War II epic Saving Private Ryan, about a group of U.S. soldiers led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) sent to bring home a paratrooper whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours of the Normandy landing. Filming took place in England, and U.S. Marine Dale Dye was hired to train the actors and keep them in character during the combat scenes. Halfway through filming, Spielberg reminded the cast that they were making a tribute to thank \"your grandparents and my dad, who fought in [the war]\". Upon release, critics praised the direction and its realistic portrayal of war. The film grossed a successful $481 million worldwide, and Spielberg won a second Academy Award for Best Director. In August 1999, Spielberg and Hanks were awarded the Distinguished Public Service Medal from Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen.\\n\\n1999–2007: Further directorial work\\nIn 2001, Spielberg and Tom Hanks produced Band of Brothers, a miniseries based on Stephen Ambrose\\'s book of the same title. The ten-part HBO series follows Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division\\'s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The series won a Golden Globe for Best Miniseries. Also in that year, Spielberg returned to film with A.I. Artificial Intelligence, a loose adaptation of the 1969 short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" by Brian Aldiss. Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick had first asked Spielberg to direct the feature in 1979. Spielberg tried to make it in the style that Kubrick would have done, with mixed results according to some reviewers. The plot revolves around an android called David (Haley Joel Osment) who wants to be a real boy. Critics thought Spielberg directed with \"sentimentality\", and Roger Ebert wrote, \"Here is one of the most ambitious films of recent years [...] but it miscalculates in asking us to invest our emotions in a character, a machine.\" The film won five Saturn Awards, and grossed $236 million worldwide.Spielberg and Tom Cruise collaborated for the futuristic neo-noir Minority Report (2002), based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, about a group of investigators who try to prevent crimes before they are committed. The film received critical acclaim. Roger Ebert named Minority Report as the best film of 2002, and praised its vision of the future. Homewer, critic Todd McCarthy thought there was not enough action.  The film earned over $358 million worldwide. The director\\'s next 2002 feature, Catch Me If You Can is about the adventures of a young con artist (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). Christopher Walken and Tom Hanks also star. It is set in the 1960s; Spielberg said, \"I have always loves movies about sensational rogues-they break the law, but you just have to love them for the moxie.\" At the 75th Academy Awards, Walken and John Williams were nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Score, respectively. The film was a critical and commercial success.The director worked with Tom Hanks again, along with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci in 2004\\'s The Terminal, a lighthearted comedy about an Eastern European man stranded in an airport. Although The Terminal was praised for its production design, the film received mixed reviews but it was a commercial success. In 2005, Spielberg directed a modern adaptation of War of the Worlds, a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks, based on H. G. Wells\\' book of the same title; Spielberg had been a fan of the book and the 1953 film. Starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, the film follows an American dock worker who is forced to look after his children, from whom he lives separately, as he struggles to protect and reunite them with their mother when extraterrestrials invade Earth. The director used storyboards to help the actors react to computer imagery that they could not see, and used natural lighting and camerawork to avoid an \"over stylized\" science fiction picture. Upon release, the film was box office hit, grossing over $600 million worldwide.Spielberg\\'s Munich (2005), is about eleven Israeli athletes who were kidnapped and murdered in the 1972 Munich massacre. The film is based on Vengeance, a book by Canadian journalist George Jonas. It was previously adapted for the screen in the 1986 television film Sword of Gideon. Spielberg, who personally remembers the incident, sought advice from former President Bill Clinton, among others, before making the film because he did not want to cause further problems in the Middle East. Although the film garnered mostly positive reviews, some critics perceived it as anti-Semitic; it is one of Spielberg\\'s most controversial films to date. Munich received five Academy Awards nominations: Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director for Spielberg. It was his sixth Best Director nomination, and fifth Best Picture nomination.In the mid-2000s, Spielberg scaled down his directing career and became selective about film projects to undertake. In December 2005, Spielberg and his partners sold DreamWorks to media conglomerate Viacom (now known as ViacomCBS). The sale was finalized in February 2006. In June 2006, Spielberg planned to make Interstellar, but abandoned the project, which was eventually directed by Christopher Nolan. During this time, Spielberg remained active as a producer; he produced 2005\\'s Memoirs of a Geisha, an adaptation of the novel by Arthur Golden. Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis co-produced Monster House (2006), marking their eighth collaboration. He also worked with Clint Eastwood for the first time, co-producing 2006\\'s Flags of Our Fathers, and Letters from Iwo Jima, with Robert Lorenz. Spielberg served as executive producer for 2007\\'s Disturbia, and the Transformers film series. In that same year, Spielberg and Mark Burnett co-produced On the Lot, a reality and competition show about filmmaking.\\n\\n2008–2015: Return to film\\nThe director returned to the Indiana Jones series in 2008 with the fourth installment titled Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Released nineteen years after Last Crusade, the film is set in 1957, pitting Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) against Soviet agents led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), searching for a telepathic crystal skull. Principal photography was complete in October 2007, and the film was released on May 22, 2008. This was his first film not released by DreamWorks since 1997. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, but some fans were disappointed by the introduction of alien life which was uncharacteristic of the previous films. Writing for The Age, Tom Ryan praised Spielberg and George Lucas for their realistic 1950s setting—\"The energy on display is impressive\". It was a box office success, grossing $790 million worldwide.\\nIn early 2009, Spielberg shot the first film in a planned trilogy of motion capture films based on The Adventures of Tintin, written by Belgian artist Hergé.The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, was co-produced by Peter Jackson, and released in 2011; it was entirely computer animated. It premiered on October 22 in Brussels, Belgium. The film was released in North American theaters on December 21, in Digital 3D and IMAX. It received generally positive reviews from critics, and grossed over $373 million worldwide. The Adventures of Tintin won Best Animated Feature at the 69th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first non-Pixar film to win the award since the category was introduced.Spielberg followed up with War Horse, shot in England in the summer of 2010. It was released four days after The Adventures of Tintin, on December 25, 2011. The film is based on the novel of the same title by Michael Morpurgo, published in 1982, and follows the long friendship between a British boy and his horse Joey before and during World War I. Distributed by Walt Disney Studios, with whom DreamWorks made a distribution deal in 2009, War Horse was the first of four consecutive Spielberg films released by Disney. War Horse had an acclaimed response from critics, and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. In his review for Salon magazine, Andrew O\\'Hehir wrote, \"at this point in his career Spielberg is pursuing personal goals, and everything that\\'s terrific and overly flat and tooth-rottingly sweet about War Horse reflects that.\"Spielberg returned to the World War II theme, co-producing the 2010 miniseries The Pacific, with Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman. The miniseries is centered on the battles in the Pacific Theater. The following year, Spielberg co-created Falling Skies, a science fiction series on the TNT network, with Robert Rodat. Spielberg also produced the 2011 Fox series Terra Nova. Terra Nova begins in the year 2149 when all life on the planet Earth is threatened with extinction resulting in scientists opening a door that allows people to travel back 85 million years to prehistoric times. In that same year, he produced J. J. Abrams\\' thriller, Super 8.Spielberg directed the historical drama Lincoln (2012), starring Daniel Day-Lewis as President Abraham Lincoln, and Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln. Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin\\'s book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, the film describes the final four months of Lincoln\\'s life. Written by Tony Kushner, the film was shot in Richmond, Virginia, in late 2011, and was released in the U.S. in November 2012. Lincoln was acclaimed, it earned more than $250 million worldwide, and was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won Best Production Design, and Day-Lewis won Best Actor for his portrayal of Lincoln. The critic from The Irish Times complimented the direction: \"Against the odds, Spielberg makes something genuinely exciting of the backstage wheedling.\"It was announced on May 2, 2013 that Spielberg would direct American Sniper, but he left the project before production began. Instead, he directed 2015\\'s Bridge of Spies, a Cold War thriller based on the 1960 U-2 incident, and focusing on James B. Donovan\\'s negotiations with the Soviets for the release of pilot Gary Powers after his aircraft was shot down over Soviet territory. The screenplay was by the Coen brothers, and the film starred Tom Hanks as Donovan, as well as Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, and Alan Alda. It was filmed in the fall of 2014 in New York City, Berlin and Wroclaw, and was released on October 16. Bridge of Spies was popular with critics, and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture; Rylance won Best Supporting Actor, becoming the second actor to win for a performance directed by Spielberg. Spielberg had planned to shoot a $200 million adaptation of Daniel H. Wilson\\'s novel Robopocalypse, adapted for the screen by Drew Goddard. Like Lincoln, it was to be released by Disney in the U.S. and Fox overseas. Spielberg postponed production indefinitely in January 2013. In March 2018, it was announced that the film will be directed by Michael Bay.\\n\\n2016–present\\nIn 2016, the director made The BFG, an adaptation of Roald Dahl\\'s children\\'s book, starring newcomer Ruby Barnhill, and Rylance as the titular Big Friendly Giant. DreamWorks bought the rights in 2010, and John Madden had intended to direct. The film was the last to be written by E.T. screenwriter Melissa Mathison before her death. It was co-produced and released by Walt Disney Pictures, marking the first Disney-branded film to be directed by Spielberg. The BFG premiered as an out-of-competition entry at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, and received a wide release in the U.S. on July 1, 2016. The BFG welcomed fair reviews; Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune compared certain scenes to the works of earlier filmmakers, while Toronto Sun\\'s Liz Braun thought that there were \"moments of wonder and delight [...] but not nearly enough\".\\nA year later, Spielberg directed The Post, an account of The Washington Post\\'s printing of the Pentagon Papers. Starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, production began in New York on May 30, 2017. Spielberg stated his attraction to the project: \"When I read the first draft of the script, this wasn\\'t something that could wait three years or two years—this was a story I felt we needed to tell today.\" The film received a wide release on January 12, 2018. The Post gained positive reception; the critic from the Associated Press thought \"Spielberg infuses every scene with tension and life and the grandeur of the ordinary that he’s always been so good at conveying.\" In 2017, Spielberg and other filmmakers were featured in the Netflix documentary series Five Came Back, which discussed the contributions of directors Frank Capra, John Ford, John Huston, George Stevens and William Wyler, about their war-related works. Spielberg also served as an executive producer.Spielberg directed 2018\\'s science fiction Ready Player One, adapted from the novel of the same title by Ernest Cline. It stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg, and Mark Rylance. The plot takes place in 2045 when much of humanity uses virtual reality to escape the real world. Ready Player One began production in July 2016, and was to be released by Warner Bros. on December 15, 2017, but was moved to March 2018 to avoid competition with Star Wars: The Last Jedi. It premiered at the 2018 South by Southwest film festival. Several critics enjoyed the action scenes, but thought the film was too long and overused the 1980s nostalgia. Spielberg is directing West Side Story, a film adaptation of the musical of the same name. Writer Tony Kushner stated in July 2017 that he was adapting the show\\'s book for Spielberg, although the score would remain unchanged, as would the late 1950s setting. The film is set for a December 2021 release.Spielberg was set to film an adaptation of David Kertzer\\'s The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara in early 2017, for release at the end of that year, but production has been postponed. It was first announced in 2014, with Tony Kushner adapting the book for the screen. Mark Rylance, in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg, was announced to star in the role of Pope Pius IX. Spielberg saw more than 2,000 kids to play the role of Edgardo Mortara.\\n\\nProspective projects\\nIn May 2009, Spielberg bought the rights to the life story of Martin Luther King, Jr., with the intention of being involved as both the producer and director. However, the purchase was made from the King estate, led by son Dexter, while the two other surviving children, the Reverend Bernice and Martin III, immediately threatened to sue, not having given their approvals to the project. As of 2015, Spielberg is attached to direct an adaptation of American photojournalist Lynsey Addario\\'s memoir It\\'s What I Do, with Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role. In April 2018, it was announced that Spielberg would direct a film adaptation of the Blackhawk comic book series. Warner Bros. will distribute the film, with David Koepp writing the script.In January 2013, HBO confirmed that it was developing a third World War II miniseries based on the book Masters of the Air by Donald L. Miller with Spielberg and Tom Hanks. NME reported in March 2017 that production was progressing under the working title The Mighty Eighth. In March 2013, Spielberg announced that he was developing a miniseries based on the life of Napoleon. In May 2016, it was announced that Cary Fukunaga is in talks to direct the miniseries for HBO, from a script by David Leland based on extensive research materials accumulated by Stanley Kubrick over the years.Spielberg will executive produce Cortes, a historical miniseries written by Steven Zaillian about the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire, and Hernán Cortés\\'s relationship with Aztec ruler Montezuma. The script is based on an earlier one from 1965 by Oscar-winner Dalton Trumbo. Javier Bardem will play the lead role of explorer Hernán Cortés. Spielberg was previously attached to direct the project as a feature film.Spielberg had planned to direct the fifth installment of the Indiana Jones series. The film is set to star Harrison Ford and will be produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. In 2016, it was announced that it would be written by David Koepp, with a release by Disney on July 19, 2019. After a change of filming and release dates, it was postponed again when Jonathan Kasdan was announced as the film\\'s new writer. Soon after, a new release date of July 9, 2021 was announced. In May 2019, Dan Fogelman was hired to write a new script, and that Kasdan\\'s story, focused on the Nazi gold train, would not be used. In February 2020, it was reported that Spielberg will not direct, but will remain as a producer.\\n\\nOther ventures\\nThe director has been an avid gamer since 1974; in 2005, Spielberg collaborated with Electronic Arts (EA) on several games including one for the Wii called Boom Blox, and its sequel Boom Blox Bash Party). He is also the creator of EA\\'s Medal of Honor series. In 1996, Spielberg helped create and design of LucasArts\\' adventure game The Dig. He also collaborated with software publishers Knowledge Adventure on the game Steven Spielberg\\'s Director\\'s Chair, which was released in 1996; Spielberg appears in the game to direct the player.Spielberg played many of LucasArts adventure games, including the first Monkey Island games. He owns a Wii, a PlayStation 3, a PSP, and an Xbox 360, and enjoys playing first-person shooters such as the Medal of Honor series and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. He has also dislikes the use of cutscenes in games, and thinks that natural storytelling is a challenge for game developers.\\n\\nFilmmaking\\nInfluences\\nSpielberg has cited Frank Capra\\'s It\\'s A Wonderful Life (1946) as an influence on \"family, community and suburbia\". He enjoyed the work of Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, John Ford, Stanley Kubrick and John Frankenheimer. In college, he was inspired by foreign films directed by Ingmar Bergman, Jacques Tati and François Truffaut. Truffaut was one of his favorite directors. Spencer Tracy has also influenced the characters of Spielberg\\'s films, as did The Twilight Zone series.\\n\\nMethod and themes\\nSpielberg often uses storyboards to visualize the sequences, with the exceptions being in E.T. and The Color Purple. After the experience of filming Jaws, the director learned to leave special effect scenes until last, and exclude the media from filming locations. Spielberg prefers to shoot quickly, with large amounts of coverage (from single-shot to multi-shot setups), so that he will have many options in the editing room. From the beginning of his career, Spielberg\\'s shooting style consisted of extreme high and low camera angles, long takes, and handheld cameras. The director also favors the use of wide-angle lens for creating depth, and by the time he was making Minority Report, Spielberg was more confident with elaborate camera movements.\\nIn an interview with The Tech in 2015, Spielberg described how he chooses the film projects he would work on:[Sometimes], a story speaks to me, even if it doesn\\'t speak to any of my collaborators or any of my partners, who look at me and scratch their heads and say, \\'Gee, are you sure you wanna get into that trench for a year and a half?\\' I love people challenging me that way because it\\'s a real test about my own convictions and [whether] I can be the standing man of my own life and take a stand on a subject that may not be popular, but that I would be proud to add to the body of my work. That\\'s pretty much the litmus test that gets me to say, \\'Yeah, I\\'ll direct that one.\\'Spielberg\\'s films contain many similar themes throughout his work. One of his most pertinent themes revolves around \"ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.\" The ordinary people often have limitations, but they succeed in becoming a \"hero\". A consistent theme in his family-friendly work is a childlike sense of wonder and faith, and \"the goodness in humanity will prevail.\" He has also explored the importance of childhood, loss of innocence, and the need for parental figures. In exploring the parent-child relationship, there is usually a flawed or irresponsible father figure. This theme personally resonates with the director\\'s childhood. Exploring extraterrestrial life is another aspect to his work. Spielberg described himself as like an \"alien\" during childhood, and this interest came from his father, a science fiction fan.\\n\\nNotable Collaborators\\nJanusz Kamiński has served as a cinematographer on 19 of Spielberg\\'s films. As Spielberg\\'s career evolved from action to drama films, he and Kamiński adopted more handheld camerawork, as evidenced in Schindler\\'s List and Amistad. Michael Khan has edited all of Spielberg\\'s films, except for one, since the 1970s. The director has also worked consistently with production designer Rick Carter, and writer David Koepp. Producer Kathleen Kennedy is one of the director\\'s longest serving collaborators. Spielberg also displays loyalty to his actors, casting them repeatedly including: Harrison Ford, Mark Rylance, Richard Dreyfuss, and Tom Hanks.The Sugarland Express was the beginning of a long-time collaboration between Spielberg and composer John Williams. Williams would return to compose all but five of Spielberg\\'s feature films (the exceptions are Twilight Zone: The Movie, The Color Purple, Bridge of Spies, Ready Player One and West Side Story). Williams won three of his five Academy Awards for his work on Spielberg\\'s films (Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and Schindler\\'s List). While making Schindler\\'s List, the director approached Williams about composing the score. After seeing a rough, unedited cut, Williams was impressed, and said that composing would be too challenging. He said to Spielberg, \"You need a better composer than I am for this film.\" Spielberg responded, \"I know. But they\\'re all dead!\" In 2016, Spielberg presented Williams with the 44th AFI Life Achievement Award, the first to be awarded to a composer.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nSpielberg met actress Amy Irving in 1976 when she auditioned for Close Encounters of the Third Kind. After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer Julia Phillips, \"I met a real heartbreaker last night.\" Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved into what she described as his \"bachelor funky\" house. They broke up in 1979. In 1984, they renewed their romance and married in November 1985. Their son, Max, was born on June 13 of that year. In 1989, the couple divorced; they agreed to live near each other to share custody of their son. Their divorce settlement is one of the most expensive in history.Spielberg met actress Kate Capshaw when he cast her in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. They married on October 12, 1991; Capshaw converted to Judaism before their marriage. Spielberg said he rediscovered \"the honor of being a Jew\" when they married. He said, \"Kate is Protestant and she insisted on converting to Judaism. She spent a year studying, did the \"mikveh,\" the whole thing. She chose to do a full conversion before we were married in 1991, and she married me after becoming a Jew. I think that, more than anything else, brought me back to Judaism.\" He credits her for the family\\'s level of observance; \"This shiksa goddess has made me a better Jew than my own parents\", he said. He and his family live in Pacific Palisades, California, and East Hampton, New York.He has seven children: Jessica Capshaw (born August 9, 1976), Max Samuel Spielberg (born June 13, 1985), Sasha Rebecca Spielberg (born May 14, 1990), Sawyer Avery Spielberg (born March 10, 1992), and Destry Allyn Spielberg (born December 1, 1996). He has two adopted children: Theo Spielberg (born August 21, 1988), and Mikaela George (born February 28, 1996).In 1997, a man named Jonathan Norman stalked and attempted to enter Spielberg\\'s home; Norman was jailed for 25 years. In 2001, Spielberg was stalked by conspiracy theorist and former social worker Diana Napolis. She accused him, and actress Jennifer Love Hewitt, of installing a mind-control device in her brain, and being part of a satanic cult. Napolis was committed to a mental institution, and plead guilty to stalking. She was released on probation with a condition that she have no contact with either Spielberg or Hewitt.In 2013, Spielberg purchased the 282-foot (86 m) mega-yacht The Seven Seas for US$182 million. He has put it up for sale and has made it available for charter. At US$1.2 million per month, it is one of the most expensive charters on the market. He has ordered a new 300-foot (91 m) yacht at a reported US$250 million.\\n\\nPolitical views\\nSpielberg has usually supported U.S. Democratic Party candidates. He has donated over $800,000 to the Democratic party and its nominees. He has been a close friend of former President Bill Clinton and worked with the President for the USA Millennium celebrations. He directed an 18-minute film for the project, scored by John Williams and entitled The American Journey. It was shown at America\\'s Millennium Gala on December 31, 1999, in the National Mall at the Reflecting Pool at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Spielberg endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election; he donated $1 million to Priorities USA Action.\\n Spielberg resigned as a member of the national advisory board of the Boy Scouts of America in 2001 because he disagreed with the organization\\'s anti-homosexuality stance. In 2007, the Arab League voted to boycott Spielberg\\'s movies after he donated $1 million for relief efforts in Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War. On February 20, 2007, Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen invited Democrats to a fundraiser for Barack Obama.In February 2008, Spielberg resigned as advisor to the 2008 Summer Olympics in response to the Chinese government\\'s inaction over the War in Darfur. Spielberg said in a statement, \"I find that my conscience will not allow me to continue business as usual [...] Sudan\\'s government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these on-going crimes, but the international community, and particularly China, should be doing more.\" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) respected Spielberg\\'s decision but IOC president Jacques Rogge expressed disappointment: \"[Spielberg] certainly would have brought a lot to the opening ceremony in terms of creativity.\" Chinese state media called the director\\'s comments \"unfair\".In September 2008, Spielberg and his wife offered their support to same-sex marriage by issuing a statement following their donation of $100,000 to the \"No on Proposition 8\" campaign fund, a figure equal to the amount of money Brad Pitt donated to the same campaign less than a week prior. In 2018, Spielberg and his wife Kate donated $500,000 to the March for Our Lives student demonstration in favor of gun control in the United States.\\n\\nLegacy\\nA notable figure of the New Hollywood era, Spielberg is one of the most commercially successful film directors in history. In 1996, Life magazine named Spielberg the most influential person of his generation. In 2003, Premiere magazine ranked him first place in the list of 100 Most Powerful People in Movies. In 2005, Empire magazine ranked him number one on a list of the greatest film directors of all time. In 2013, Time magazine listed him as one of the 100 Most Important People of the Century. According to Forbes\\' magazine of Most Influential Celebrities of 2014, Spielberg was ranked at first place.

Spielberg\\'s films have also influenced directors J. J. Abrams, Paul Thomas Anderson, Neill Blomkamp, Guillermo del Toro, Roland Emmerich, Peter Jackson, Kal Ng, Robert Rodriguez, John Sayles, Ridley Scott, John Singleton, Kevin Smith, and Gareth Edwards.Film critic Tom Shone said of Spielberg, \"If you have to point to any one director of the last twenty-five years in whose work the medium of film was most fully itself – where we found out what it does best when left to its own devices, it has to be that guy.\" Jess Cagle, former editor of Entertainment Weekly, called Spielberg \"...arguably (well, who would argue?) the greatest filmmaker in history.\" Stephen Rowley writing for Senses of Cinema, discussed Spielberg\\'s strengths as a filmmaker, saying \"there is a welcome complexity of tone and approach in these later films that defies the lazy stereotypes often bandied about his films\", and that \"Spielberg continues to take risks, with his body of work continuing to grow more impressive and ambitious\", concluding that he has only received \"limited, begrudging recognition\" from critics.Spielberg\\'s critics have argued that his films are overly sentimental and tritely moralistic. In Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, Peter Biskind wrote that the director is \"infantilizing the audience, reconstituting the spectator as child, then overwhelming him and her with sound and spectacle, obliterating irony, aesthetic self-consciousness, and critical reflection.\" Critic Ray Carney and actor Crispin Glover claimed that Spielberg\\'s films lack depth and do not take risks. Critic Pauline Kael, who enjoyed Spielberg\\'s films in the 1970s, expressed disappointment in his later work, stating that \"he\\'s become, I think, a very bad director.... And I\\'m a little ashamed for him, because I loved his early work.... [H]e turned to virtuous movies. And he\\'s become so uninteresting now.... I think that he had it in him to become more of a fluid, far-out director. But, instead, he\\'s become a melodramatist.\" Filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard opined that Spielberg was partly responsible for the lack of artistic merit in mainstream cinema, and accused Spielberg of using Schindler\\'s List to profit from a tragedy. In defense of Spielberg, critic Roger Ebert said \"Has Godard or any other director living or dead done more than Spielberg, with his Holocaust Project, to honor and preserve the memories of the survivors?\"Seven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\": Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Jurassic Park, Schindler\\'s List, and Saving Private Ryan.\\n\\nAwards and recognition\\nSpielberg has won three Academy Awards. He received seven nominations for Best Director, and won twice (for Schindler\\'s List and Saving Private Ryan). His third was in Best Picture, for Schindler\\'s List. In 1987, he was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his work as a creative producer.

              " 'Taps (film)': 'Taps is a 1981 American drama film starring George C. Scott and Timothy Hutton, with Ronny Cox, Tom Cruise, Sean Penn, and Evan Handler in supporting roles.  Hutton was nominated for a Golden Globe award in 1982. The film was directed by Harold Becker from a screenplay by Robert Mark Kamen, James Lineberger, and Darryl Ponicsan, based on Devery Freeman\\'s 1979 novel Father Sky. The original music score was composed by Maurice Jarre. It was filmed at Valley Forge Military Academy and College.\\nThe film follows a group of military school students who decide to take over their school to save it from closing. It was Penn\\'s first film role, and Cruise\\'s second and his first major role following a brief appearance in Endless Love a few months earlier.\\n\\nPlot\\nBunker Hill Military Academy has just concluded another school year. Cadet Brian Moreland (Timothy Hutton), a junior, meets privately with the academy commandant, retired Brigadier General Harlan Bache (George C. Scott). Bache promotes Moreland to Cadet Major, the paramount rank at BHMA. Bache also reflects on the time when he was a cadet at West Point (Moreland\\'s intended college), as well as a graduate of BHMA prior to that, and how he dreads his forthcoming retirement. Moreland is congratulated first by his best friend Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer (Sean Penn), as well as by Cadet Captain David Shawn (Tom Cruise) and Cadet Lieutenant Edward West (Evan Handler). Shawn leads a celebration in the hallway. The commencement proceeds, with a parade and a pass in review.\\nFollowing the ceremonies, General Bache announces that BHMA\\'s board of trustees is selling the school to real estate developers. The school will remain open for one year in order to allow the seniors to graduate and give the underclassmen time to apply to other schools. The delay gives many cadets hope that BHMA can be saved. Bache also hopes that the institute can be saved, as he remarks to Moreland, \"We are here, and the condos are not\".\\nThe graduation ceremony is followed by a ball that evening. Outside the gates, a brawl erupts when several local teenagers harass the cadets, which escalates into one local assaulting a sentry. General Bache tries to break up the fight, but his service pistol is seized by one of the teens and the weapon discharges, killing a second teen. Although the magazine had been removed, a round was still in the chamber. Bache is arrested and charged with manslaughter. However, the trauma of the event combined with the arrest triggered a heart attack and Bache is hospitalized in critical condition. The board of trustees closes BHMA immediately.\\nSince Bache is ill, Moreland meets with the officers of the cadet corps and they take control of Bunker Hill. The Dean of Students (Jess Osuna) arrives with the local Sheriff (James Handy) to empty the armory. They find the weapons in the hands of an armed cadre led by Major Moreland, who demands to meet with General Bache and the trustees so that BHMA will be kept open. The Dean and Sheriff are escorted off the campus by armed cadets, who secure the perimeter.\\nAt the same time, cadets are sent to a local warehouse for the purpose of restocking BHMA\\'s provisions, but one of the trucks breaks down on the way back. As Dwyer is attempting to fix the engine, townies surround the truck, demanding vengeance for the death of their friend. After Dwyer is accosted and Pierce is pulled out of the stalled truck Shawn fires several bursts from his M16 into the air, dispersing the mob. The cadets abandon the stalled truck, fleeing the scene in the second truck, ramming a police car that was blocking their path. The State police surround the campus, but Moreland orders and Shawn oversees a defense of the wall which turns into a standoff. \\nMoreland reveals to Dwyer that he has been at Bunker Hill since the age of 12 after his mother died in an army hospital. Moreland says his father permitted him to cry for only fifteen minutes. Dwyer comes to a better understanding of Moreland - that he regards Bunker Hill as his home and General Bache as a surrogate father, and is now facing the loss of both.\\nA delegation of parents and trustees is admitted. The parents include Moreland\\'s father (Wayne Tippit), a master sergeant in the US Army, who bluntly orders his son to end the standoff. He fails to sway Moreland. The conversation between Moreland and his father becomes increasingly heated when Moreland\\'s father speaks derisively of General Bache, and culminates with Moreland being struck in the face by his father.  \\nTo show the police and parents that none of the boys are being held against their will, Moreland assembles the cadets and offers them a chance to walk out. They all choose to stay. The siege grows more tense when the National Guard, led by Colonel Kerby (Ronny Cox), arrives. Kerby admires the academy and does not wish to see it closed. He even offers to help Moreland fight for the academy, provided that they do it through legal means and not by force of arms.  He warns Moreland that his loyalty is to the state legislature, which has been inundated with calls from concerned families and from locals who are scared by the standoff. Despite the Colonel\\'s diplomatic approach, he fails to sway Moreland.\\nThe next morning, it is discovered that eleven cadets have fled. Moreland assembles the battalion, to whom he again offers the opportunity to leave. Led by Lt. West, a number of the cadets discard their weapons and leave. Dwyer, upset by Moreland’s behavior berates Moreland for living in a fantasy that he and Bache created and makes reference to the relationship being homosexual. This ends up in a fight between the two with Shawn holding anyone back that might attempt to break the two up. At this point The Authorities shut off the power to the campus thus ending the fight between the two upper-classmen. Moreland tells Dwyer he does not have to stay on just out of loyalty to him as a friend, but Dwyer just tells him \"don\\'t worry.\" And Dwyer does stay on after this through the end.\\nWhile restarting the school\\'s gasoline-powered generator, Cadet Pierce (Giancarlo Esposito) is burned. An ambulance is permitted to enter and take the injured Pierce away. Colonel Kerby once again tries to reason with Moreland, and Moreland agrees, provided he be brought to the hospital and Bache orders him to stand down. Kerby says that Bache died the night before. Upon hearing the news, Moreland ceases negotiations with Kerby.\\nThe cadets hold a military memorial service in his honor, to include a riderless horse. Even Kerby and the Guardsmen stand at attention at the front gates.\\nThe next night, a tank approaches the main gate. Two young cadets, Derek (John P. Navin Jr.) and Charlie (Brendan Ward), Moreland’s underclassman, are on sentry duty. Derek, the older of the two, panics and rushes to surrender. Charlie tries to stop him. Derek drops his rifle, which goes off as it hits the ground. The Guardsmen open fire. Derek safely reaches the gate, but Charlie is killed.\\nCharlie\\'s death weakens Moreland\\'s resolve and Dwyer persuades him to end the occupation. They muster the cadets and order them to stand down. Everyone complies except Shawn, who opens fire from the barracks with an M60 machine gun. As the Guardsmen return fire, Dwyer and Moreland rush inside to stop Shawn. When Moreland attempts to stop Shawn, a volley of bullets from the Guardsmen hits the building and kills both of them. Dwyer carries Moreland\\'s body out of the barracks as Kerby, the National Guardsmen, and the remaining Cadets look on.\\n\\nCast\\nReception\\nFilm review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 68% of the 25 sampled critics gave the film a positive review and that it got an average score of 6.2/10. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars (out of four), comparing the film to the classic novel Lord of the Flies (1954).The film earned North American rentals of $20.5 million.\\n\\nHome media\\nThe film was released on DVD on March 5, 2002 and also was released on Blu-ray on May 3, 2011.\\n\\nSee also\\nList of American films of 1981\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nTaps at IMDb\\nTaps at Box Office Mojo',\n",
              " 'The Color of Money': 'The Color of Money is a 1986 American sports drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and released by Touchstone Pictures. The film was created from a screenplay by Richard Price, based on the 1984 novel of the same name by Walter Tevis. The film stars Paul Newman and Tom Cruise, with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Helen Shaver, and John Turturro in supporting roles. It features an original score by Robbie Robertson.\\nThe film continues the story of pool hustler and stakehorse Edward \"Fast Eddie\" Felson from Tevis\\' first novel, The Hustler (1959), with Newman reprising his role from the 1961 film adaptation. It begins more than 25 years after the events of the previous film, with Eddie retired from the pool circuit. Newman won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, his first Oscar win after eight nominations, seven of them for Best Actor. \\nThe film centered around the game of nine-ball, a pool variant played for high stakes. A challenge nine-ball match was named after it in 1997 at which Efren Reyes defeated Earl Strickland to win the largest single match purse in pool history of $100K.\\n\\nPlot\\n“Fast” Eddie Felson is a former pool hustler turned successful liquor salesman in Chicago. He still stakes bets for players, including fellow hustler Julian, who is outmatched at nine-ball by the young and charismatic Vincent Lauria. Recognizing Vincent’s skill, and his girlfriend Carmen’s inexperience at luring players to lose money, Eddie tells the couple of their excellent potential for hustling.\\nCarmen visits Eddie alone to inquire about his interest in Vincent. Finding him working at Child World, Eddie invites Vincent to leave the next day for six weeks of hustling on the road, culminating in a nine-ball tournament in Atlantic City. Manipulating Vincent’s insecurities about Carmen and giving him a valuable Balabushka cue stick, Eddie persuades him to accept his offer. Eddie’s abrupt departure upsets Julian, as well as Eddie’s girlfriend Janelle.\\nVincent and Carmen hit the road with Eddie in his Cadillac, visiting a series of pool halls. Serving as Vincent’s stakehorse, Eddie attempts to teach him the art of hustling, but Vincent chafes at having to play below his ability. At a pool hall run by his old acquaintance Orvis, Eddie becomes fed up with Vincent’s arrogance and leaves him. Rebuking Carmen for her advances toward him, Eddie reminds her they are partners with a mutual business interest in Vincent. Eddie returns to find Vincent grandstanding to “Werewolves of London”, beating the pool hall’s best player but scaring off a wealthier mark. Eddie and Vincent talk frankly, agreeing Vincent must curb his ego if they are to succeed.\\nEddie and Carmen struggle to rein in Vincent’s showboating, and his jealousy when they pose as lovers during a scam. After a string of successful games, Vincent plays the famed Grady Seasons, but is directed by Eddie to dump the game, to inflate the odds against Vincent in Atlantic City. Goaded by Grady, Vincent almost fails to throw the game, and Eddie is inspired to play again. After some success, Eddie is taken by a pool shark named Amos. Humiliated, Eddie leaves Vincent and Carmen with enough money to make it to Atlantic City, taking the Balabushka.\\nEddie refines his skills at Orvis’ pool hall, gets into shape by swimming laps, and gets a pair of corrective lens sunglasses. On a winning streak, he enters the Atlantic City tournament and runs into Vincent and Carmen, overhearing them arrange a bet with another player. Eddie, winning against Julian; and Vincent, beating Grady, are set to face each other. Janelle arrives to support Eddie, who triumphs against Vincent. As Eddie and Janelle celebrate, Vincent and Carmen surprise Eddie with $8,000 – his “cut” of Vincent’s winnings from intentionally losing their match.\\nIn his semifinal match, Eddie sees his reflection in the two-ball; disgruntled, he forfeits the game and returns Vincent’s money. With plans to live with Janelle, and determined to win legitimately, Eddie faces Vincent in a private match, declaring \"I\\'m back!\"\\n\\nCast\\nPaul Newman as Eddie \\'Fast Eddie\\' Felson\\nTom Cruise as Vincent Lauria\\nMary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Carmen\\nHelen Shaver as Janelle\\nJohn Turturro as Julian\\nBill Cobbs as Orvis\\nForest Whitaker as Amos\\n\\nProduction\\nThe Color of Money is an American sports film directed by Martin Scorsese and was released by Touchstone Pictures. The film was created from a screenplay by Richard Price, based on the 1984 novel of the same name by Walter Tevis. Although Tevis did author a screenplay, adapting the storyline from his novel, the filmmakers decided not to use it, instead crafting an entirely different story under Tevis\\' title.Scorsese has cited the influence of techniques and lighting in the 1947 Powell-Pressburger Black Narcissus in making the film. In particular he states that the extreme close ups of Tom Cruise around the pool table were inspired by those of the nuns in that film. Lead star Paul Newman said that the best advice he was given by Scorsese was to \"try not to be funny\". Cruise performed most of his own pool shots. An exception was a jump shot over two balls to pot another. Scorsese believed Cruise could learn the shot, but that it would take too long, so the shot was performed for him by professional player Mike Sigel. Cruise mentioned that to prepare for the role, he bought a pool table for his apartment and practiced for hours on end. Standing in for the extremely valuable \"Balabushka\" cue in the movie was actually a Joss J-18 (which later became the Joss 10-N7), made to resemble a classic Balabushka.Sigel was a technical director, and he and fellow player Ewa Mataya Laurance served as technical consultants and shot performers on the film. Absent from the film is the character Minnesota Fats, played by Jackie Gleason in The Hustler. Newman later said that he had wanted the character to appear, but that none of the attempts to include him fit well into the story that was being written. According to Scorsese, Gleason apparently agreed with Newman\\'s opinion that Minnesota Fats was not essential to the film\\'s story. Scorsese said that Gleason was presented a draft of the script that had Fats worked into the narrative, but that upon reading it, Gleason declined to reprise the role because he felt that the character seemed to have been added as \"an afterthought\".\\n\\nSoundtrack\\nThe soundtrack to the motion picture was released by MCA Records in 1986.Track listing:\\n\\nRelease\\nThe Color of Money held its world premiere at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City in New York, on 8 October 1986. The film was commercially released in the United States on 17 October 1986. The American release was limited to only select theaters throughout the country, with the film opening in more theaters during the next four weeks of its initial release. After its run, the film grossed $52,293,982 domestically. The film was first released on DVD on 14 March 2000. The film was later released on Blu-ray on 5 June 2012. Neither of the releases contain any special features pertaining to the film itself.\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nThe film received positive critical response upon its release, though some critics thought that the film was an inferior followup to The Hustler. Based on 47 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an 89% approval rating from critics, with an average score of 7.17/10. It comments that \"it\\'s inferior to the original goes without saying, but Paul Newman and Tom Cruise are a joy to watch, and Martin Scorsese\\'s direction is typically superb\". Media review aggregator website Metacritic reported an weighted average score of 77/100 based on 17 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Siskel and Ebert gave the film \"two thumbs down\", Scorsese\\'s only film to receive such a review from the team.The film was praised for the major cast. Vincent Canby writing for the New York Times commented on the \"three fully realized\" main characters, and the journey throughout the film with them is \"most satisfying\". Canby, however, also commented that it \"lacks in narrative shapeliness\", before giving the film 9/10. Sheila Benson for the Los Angeles Times called these characters an \"electrifying unholy trio\", and praising the metaphors between hustling and pool. Miami Herald writer Bill Cosford, however, commented that \"whatever Scorsese and Price have to say about these marvelous characters, it is not anything interesting.\"\\n\\nAccolades\\nLegacy\\nA line in the film spoken by Tom Cruise\\'s character, \"In here? Doom.\" inspired the title of the popular 1993 video game, Doom. The 1996 nine-ball challenge match between Efren Reyes and Earl Strickland was named \"The Color of Money II\" in honor of the film.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nThe Color of Money at IMDb\\nThe Color of Money at the TCM Movie Database\\nThe Color of Money at AllMovie\\nThe Color of Money at the American Film Institute Catalog\\nThe Color of Money at Rotten Tomatoes',\n",
              " 'The Daily Telegraph': 'The Daily Telegraph, known online and elsewhere as The Telegraph (), is a national British daily broadsheet newspaper published in London by Telegraph Media Group and distributed across the United Kingdom and internationally.\\nIt was founded by Arthur B. Sleigh in 1855 as Daily Telegraph & Courier. The Telegraph has been described as a newspaper of record and generally had an international reputation in the twentieth century for quality, described by Amol Rajan as \"one of the world\\'s great titles\".The paper\\'s motto, \"Was, is, and will be\", appears in the editorial pages and has featured in every edition of the newspaper since 19 April 1858. The paper had a circulation of 363,183 in December 2018, descending further until it withdrew from newspaper circulation audits in 2019, having declined almost 80%, much faster than industry trends, from 1.4 million in 1980. Its sister paper, The Sunday Telegraph, which started in 1961, had a circulation of 281,025 as of December 2018. The two sister newspapers are run separately, with different editorial staff, but there is cross-usage of stories.\\nThe Telegraph has been the first newspaper to report on a number of notable news scoops, including the 2009 MP expenses scandal - which led to a number of high-profile political resignations and for which it was named 2009 British Newspaper of the Year -  and its 2016 undercover investigation on the England football manager Sam Allardyce. However, critics, including the paper\\'s former chief political commentator Peter Oborne, accuse it of being unduly influenced by advertisers, especially HSBC.It was reported on 26 October 2019 that the owners of the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph were to put both titles up for sale following diminishing profit and circulation, after rumours of a sale had been denied for several years.\\n\\nHistory\\nFounding and early history\\nThe Daily Telegraph and Courier was founded by Colonel Arthur B. Sleigh in June 1855 to air a personal grievance against the future commander-in-chief of the British Army, Prince George, Duke of Cambridge. Joseph Moses Levy, the owner of The Sunday Times, agreed to print the newspaper, and the first edition was published on 29 June 1855. The paper cost 2d and was four pages long. Nevertheless, the first edition stressed the quality and independence of its articles and journalists:\\nWe shall be guided by a high tone of independent action.\\nHowever, the paper was not a success, and Sleigh was unable to pay Levy the printing bill. Levy took over the newspaper, his aim being to produce a cheaper newspaper than his main competitors in London, the Daily News and The Morning Post, to expand the size of the overall market. Levy appointed his son, Edward Levy-Lawson, Lord Burnham, and Thornton Leigh Hunt to edit the newspaper. Lord Burnham relaunched the paper as The Daily Telegraph, with the slogan \"the largest, best, and cheapest newspaper in the world\". Hunt laid out the newspaper\\'s principles in a memorandum sent to Levy: \"We should report all striking events in science, so told that the intelligent public can understand what has happened and can see its bearing on our daily life and our future. The same principle should apply to all other events—to fashion, to new inventions, to new methods of conducting business\".In 1876, Jules Verne published his novel Michael Strogoff, whose plot takes place during a fictional uprising and war in Siberia. Verne included among the book\\'s characters a war correspondent of The Daily Telegraph, named Harry Blount—who is depicted as an exceptionally dedicated, resourceful and brave journalist, taking great personal risks to follow closely the ongoing war and bring accurate news of it to The Telegraph\\'s readership, ahead of competing papers.\\n\\n1901 to 1945\\nIn 1908, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany gave a controversial interview to The Daily Telegraph that severely damaged Anglo-German relations and added to international tensions in the build-up to World War I. In 1928, the son of Baron Burnham, Harry Lawson Webster Levy-Lawson, 2nd Baron Burnham, sold the paper to William Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose, in partnership with his brother Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley and Edward Iliffe, 1st Baron Iliffe.\\nIn 1937, the newspaper absorbed The Morning Post, which traditionally espoused a conservative position and sold predominantly amongst the retired officer class.  Originally William Ewart Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose, bought The Morning Post with the intention of publishing it alongside The Daily Telegraph, but poor sales of the former led him to merge the two. For some years, the paper was retitled The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post before it reverted to just The Daily Telegraph.  In the late 1930s, Victor Gordon Lennox, The Telegraph\\'s diplomatic editor, published an anti-appeasement private newspaper The Whitehall Letter that received much of its information from leaks from Sir Robert Vansittart, the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office, and Rex Leeper, the Foreign Office\\'s Press Secretary. As a result, Gordon Lennox was monitored by MI5. In 1939, The Telegraph published Clare Hollingworth\\'s scoop that Germany was to invade Poland.In November 1940, with Fleet Street subjected to almost daily bombing raids by the Luftwaffe, The Telegraph started printing in Manchester at Kemsley House (now The Printworks entertainment venue), which was run by Camrose\\'s brother Kemsley.  Manchester quite often printed the entire run of The Telegraph when its Fleet Street offices were under threat.  The name Kemsley House was changed to Thomson House in 1959. In 1986, printing of Northern editions of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph moved to Trafford Park and in 2008 to Newsprinters at Knowsley, Liverpool.\\nDuring the Second World War, The Daily Telegraph covertly helped in the recruitment of code-breakers for Bletchley Park. The ability to solve The Telegraph\\'s crossword in under 12 minutes was considered to be a recruitment test. The newspaper was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which each of the successful participants was contacted and asked if they would be prepared to undertake \"a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort\". The competition itself was won by F. H. W. Hawes of Dagenham who finished the crossword in less than eight minutes.\\n\\n1946 to 1985\\nBoth the Camrose (Berry) and Burnham (Levy-Lawson) families remained involved in management until Conrad Black took control in 1986. On the death of his father in 1954, Seymour Berry, 2nd Viscount Camrose assumed the chairmanship of the Daily Telegraph with his brother Michael Berry, Baron Hartwell as his editor-in-chief. During this period, the company saw the launch of sister paper The Sunday Telegraph in 1960.\\n\\n1986 to 2004\\nCanadian businessman Conrad Black, through companies controlled by him, bought the Telegraph Group in 1986. Black, through his holding company Ravelston Corporation, owned 78% of Hollinger Inc. which in turn owned 30% of Hollinger International.  Hollinger International in turn owned the Telegraph Group and other publications such as the Chicago Sun-Times, the Jerusalem Post and The Spectator.\\nOn 18 January 2004, Black was dismissed as chairman of the Hollinger International board over allegations of financial wrongdoing. Black was also sued by the company. Later that day, it was reported that the Barclay brothers had agreed to purchase Black\\'s 78% interest in Hollinger Inc. for £245m, giving them a controlling interest in the company, and to buy out the minority shareholders later.  However, a lawsuit was filed by the Hollinger International board to try to block Black from selling his shares in Hollinger Inc. until an investigation into his dealings was completed. Black filed a countersuit but, eventually, United States judge Leo Strine sided with the Hollinger International board and blocked Black from selling his Hollinger Inc. shares to the twins.\\nOn 7 March 2004, the twins announced that they were launching another bid, this time just for The Daily Telegraph and its Sunday sister paper rather than all of Hollinger Inc. The then owner of the Daily Express, Richard Desmond, was also interested in purchasing the paper, selling his interest in several pornographic magazines to finance the initiative. Desmond withdrew in March 2004, when the price climbed above £600m, as did Daily Mail and General Trust plc a few months later on 17 June.\\n\\nSince 2004\\nIn November 2004, The Telegraph celebrated the tenth anniversary of its website, Electronic Telegraph, now renamed www.telegraph.co.uk. The Electronic Telegraph launched in 1995 with \\'The Daily Telegraph Guide to the Internet\\' by writer Sue Schofield for an annual charge of £180.00. On 8 May 2006, the first stage of a major redesign of the website took place, with a wider page layout and greater prominence for audio, video and journalist blogs.\\nOn 10 October 2005, The Daily Telegraph relaunched to incorporate a tabloid sports section and a new standalone business section. The Daily Mail\\'s star columnist and political analyst Simon Heffer left that paper in October 2005 to rejoin The Daily Telegraph, where he has become associate editor. Heffer has written two columns a week for the paper since late October 2005 and is a regular contributor to the news podcast. In November 2005 the first regular podcast service by a newspaper in the UK was launched. Just before Christmas 2005, it was announced that The Telegraph titles would be moving from Canada Place in Canary Wharf, to new offices at Victoria Plaza at 111 Buckingham Palace Road near Victoria Station in central London. The new office features a \"hub and spoke\" layout for the newsroom to produce content for print and online editions.\\nIn October 2006, with its relocation to Victoria, the company was renamed the Telegraph Media Group, repositioning itself as a multimedia company. On 2 September 2008, the Daily Telegraph was printed with colour on each page for the first time when it left Westferry for Newsprinters at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, another arm of the Murdoch (Rupert Murdoch) company. The paper is also printed in Liverpool and Glasgow by Newsprinters. In May 2009, the daily and Sunday editions published details of MPs\\' expenses. This led to a number of high-profile resignations from both the ruling Labour administration and the Conservative opposition.\\nIn June 2014, The Telegraph was criticised by Private Eye for its policy of replacing experienced journalists and news managers with less-experienced staff and search engine optimisers.On 26 October 2019, the Financial Times reported that the Barclay Brothers were about to put the Telegraph Media Group up for sale. The Financial Times also reported that the Daily Mail and General Trust (owner of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday, Metro and Ireland on Sunday) would be interested in buying.\\n\\nPolitical stance\\nThe Daily Telegraph has been politically conservative in modern times. The personal links between the paper\\'s editors and the leadership of the Conservative Party, along with the paper\\'s generally right-wing stance and influence over Conservative activists, have resulted in the paper commonly being referred to, especially in Private Eye, as the Torygraph. Even when Conservative support was shown to have slumped in the opinion polls and Labour gained the ascendant, the newspaper remained loyal to the Conservatives. This loyalty continued after Labour ousted the Conservatives from power by an election result in 1997, and in the face of Labour election wins in 2001 and the third successive Labour election win in 2005.\\nWhen the Barclay brothers purchased the Telegraph Group for around £665m in late June 2004, Sir David Barclay suggested that The Daily Telegraph might no longer be the \"house newspaper\" of the Conservatives in the future. In an interview with The Guardian he said, \"Where the government are right we shall support them\". The editorial board endorsed the Conservative Party in the 2005 general election.During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the paper supported the Better Together \\'No\\' Campaign. Alex Salmond, the former leader of the SNP, called The Telegraph \"extreme\" on Question Time in September 2015.During the 2019 Conservative leadership election, The Daily Telegraph endorsed Boris Johnson. In 2019, former columnist Graham Norton, who had left the paper in late 2018, said \"about a year before I left, it took a turn\" and criticised it for \"toxic\" political stances, namely for a piece defending US Supreme Court then-nominee Brett Kavanaugh and for being \"a mouthpiece for Boris Johnson\" whose columns were allegedly published with \"no fact-checking at all\".It was fined £30,000 in 2015 for \"sending an unsolicited email to hundreds of thousands of its subscribers, urging them to vote for the Conservatives.\"\\n\\nClimate change\\nThe Telegraph has published multiple columns and news articles which promote pseudoscientific views on climate change, and misleadingly cast the subject of climate change as a subject of active scientific debate when in actuality there is a scientific consensus on climate change. It has published columns about the \"conspiracy behind the Anthropogenic Global Warming myth\", described climate scientists as \"white-coated prima donnas and narcissists,\" and claimed that \"global warming causes about as much damage as benefits.\" In 2015, a Telegraph news article falsely claimed that scientists predicted a mini-ice age by 2030. Climate change denying journalist James Delingpole was first to use \"Climategate\" on his Telegraph blog for a manufactured controversy where emails were leaked from climate scientists ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit and misleadingly presented to give the appearance that the climate scientists were engaged in fraud.In 2014, The Telegraph was one of several media titles to give evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee \\'Communicating climate science\\'. The paper told MPs they believe climate change is happening and humans play a role in it. Editors told the committee, \"we believe that the climate is changing, that the reason for that change includes human activity, but that human ingenuity and adaptability should not be ignored in favour of economically damaging prescriptions.\"\\n\\nLGBT+ rights\\nThe newspaper opposed equal marriage in the UK through both its columnists and editorials. It published an article by former editor Charles Moore titled \\'Will equal marriage lead to people marrying dogs?\\'. In 2015, it published another article by Moore claiming a \"gay rights sharia\" was forcing the NHS to give access to in vitro fertilisation to LGBT+ people. In 2018 Graham Norton quit his column due to the newspapers \"toxic\" political stance on LGBT+ and women\\'s rights.The Telegraph has published articles which have been criticised as transphobic. In 2017 the newspaper published an article by Allison Pearson describing a review of the Gender Recognition Act \"spineless politicians, pathetically eager to be on-trend\" and that the review was due to \"biological science lies\" calling  transgender identity \"a warped ideology\". In the same year it published an article also by Pearson titled \"Will our spineless politicians\\' love affair with LGBT ever end?\" and another in 2018, \"The tyranny of the transgender minority has got to be stopped\"\\n\\nSister publications\\nThe Sunday Telegraph\\nThe Daily Telegraph\\'s sister Sunday paper was founded in 1961. The writer Sir Peregrine Worsthorne is probably the best known journalist associated with the title (1961–1997), eventually being editor for three years from 1986. In 1989, the Sunday title was briefly merged into a seven-day operation under Max Hastings\\'s overall control. In 2005, the paper was revamped, with Stella being added to the more traditional television and radio section. It costs £2.20 and includes separate Money, Living, Sport and Business supplements.\\nCirculation of The Sunday Telegraph in July 2010 was 505,214 (ABC)\\n\\nThe Young Telegraph\\nThe Young Telegraph was a weekly section of The Daily Telegraph published as a 14-page supplement in the weekend edition of the newspaper. The Young Telegraph featured a mixture of news, features, cartoon strips and product reviews aimed at 8–12-year-olds. It was edited by Damien Kelleher (1993–1997) and Kitty Melrose (1997–1999). Launched in 1990, the award-winning supplement also ran original serialised stories featuring popular brands such as Young Indiana Jones and the British children\\'s sitcom Maid Marian and Her Merry Men.\\nIn 1995, an interactive spin-off called Electronic Young Telegraph was launched on floppy disk. Described as an interactive computer magazine for children, Electronic Young Telegraph was edited by Adam Tanswell, who led the relaunch of the product on CD-Rom in 1998. Electronic Young Telegraph featured original content including interactive quizzes, informative features and computer games, as well as entertainment news and reviews. It was later re-branded as T:Drive in 1999.\\n\\nWebsite\\nTelegraph.co.uk is the online version of the newspaper. It uses banner title The Telegraph and includes articles from the print editions of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph, as well as web-only content such as breaking news, features, picture galleries and blogs. It was named UK Consumer Website of the Year in 2007 and Digital Publisher of the year in 2009 by the Association of Online Publishers. The site is overseen by Kate Day, digital director of Telegraph Media Group. Other staff include Shane Richmond, head of technology (editorial), and Ian Douglas, head of digital production. The site, which has been the focus of the group\\'s efforts to create an integrated news operation producing content for print and online from the same newsroom, completed a relaunch during 2008 involving the use of the Escenic content management system, popular among northern European and Scandinavian newspaper groups. Telegraph TV is a Video on Demand service run by The Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph. It is hosted on The Telegraph\\'s website, telegraph.co.uk.\\nTelegraph.co.uk became the most popular UK newspaper site in April 2008. It was overtaken by Guardian.co.uk in April 2009 and later by \"Mail Online\". As of December 2010, \"Telegraph.co.uk\" was the third most visited British newspaper website with 1.7 million daily browsers compared to 2.3 million for \"Guardian.co.uk\" and nearly 3 million for \"Mail Online\".In November 2012, international customers accessing the Telegraph.co.uk site would have to sign up for a subscription package. Visitors had access to 20 free articles a month before having to subscribe for unlimited access. In March 2013, the pay meter system was also rolled out in the UK.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe website was launched, under the name electronic telegraph at midday on 15 November 1994 at the headquarters of The Daily Telegraph at Canary Wharf in London Docklands with Ben Rooney as its first editor.  It was Europe\\'s first daily web-based newspaper. At this time, the modern internet was still in its infancy, with as few as 10,000 websites estimated to have existed at the time – compared to more than 100 billion by 2009. In 1994, only around 1% of the British population (some 600,000 people) had internet access at home, compared to more than 80% in 2009.Initially, the site published only the top stories from the print edition of the newspaper but it gradually increased its coverage until virtually all of the newspaper was carried online and the website was also publishing original material. The website, hosted on a Sun Microsystems Sparc 20 server and connected via a 64 kbit/s leased line from Demon Internet, was edited by Ben Rooney. Key personnel behind the launch of the site were Matthew Doull and Saul Klein and the then marketing manager of The Daily Telegraph, Hugo Drayton, and the webmaster Fiona Carter. Drayton later became managing director of the newspaper.\\nAn early coup for the site was the publication of articles by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard on Bill Clinton and the Whitewater controversy. The availability of the articles online brought a large American audience to the site. In 1997, the Clinton administration issued a 331-page report that accused Evans-Pritchard of peddling \"right-wing inventions\". Derek Bishton, who by then had succeeded Rooney as editor, later wrote: \"In the days before ET it would have been highly unlikely that anyone in the US would have been aware of Evans-Pritchard\\'s work – and certainly not to the extent that the White House would be forced to issue such a lengthy rebuttal.\" Bishton, who later became consulting editor for Telegraph Media Group, was followed as editor by Richard Burton, who was made redundant in August 2006. Edward Roussel replaced Burton.\\n\\nMy Telegraph\\nMy Telegraph offers a platform for readers to have their own blog, save articles, and network with other readers. Launched in May 2007, My Telegraph won a Cross Media Award from international newspaper organisation IFRA in October 2007. One of the judges, Robert Cauthorn, described the project as \"the best deployment of blogging yet seen in any newspaper anywhere in the world\".\\n\\nNotable stories\\nIn December 2010, Telegraph reporters posing as constituents secretly recorded Business Secretary Vince Cable. In an undisclosed part of the transcript given to the BBC\\'s Robert Peston by a whistleblower unhappy that The Telegraph had not published Cable\\'s comments in full, Cable stated in reference to Rupert Murdoch\\'s News Corporation takeover bid for BSkyB, \"I have declared war on Mr Murdoch and I think we are going to win.\" Following this revelation, Cable had his responsibility for media affairs – including ruling on Murdoch\\'s takeover plans – withdrawn from his role as business secretary.In May 2011, the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint regarding The Telegraph\\'s use of subterfuge: \"On this occasion, the commission was not convinced that the public interest was such as to justify proportionately this level of subterfuge.\" In July 2011, a firm of private investigators hired by The Telegraph to track the source of the leak concluded \"strong suspicion\" that two former Telegraph employees who had moved to News International, one of them Will Lewis, had gained access to the transcript and audio files and leaked them to Peston.\\n\\n2009 MP expenses scandal\\nIn May 2009, The Daily Telegraph obtained a full copy of all the expenses claims of British Members of Parliament. The Telegraph began publishing, in instalments from 8 May 2009, certain MPs\\' expenses.The Telegraph justified the publication of the information because it contended that the official information due to be released would have omitted key information about redesignating of second-home nominations. This led to a number of high-profile resignations from both the ruling Labour administration and the Conservative opposition.\\n\\n2016 Sam Allardyce investigation\\nIn September 2016, Telegraph reporters posing as businessmen filmed England manager Sam Allardyce, offering to give advice on how to get around on FA rules on player third party ownership and negotiating a £400,000 deal. The investigation saw Allardyce leave his job by mutual consent on 27 September and making the statement \"entrapment has won\".\\n\\nAwards\\nThe Daily Telegraph has been named the National Newspaper of the Year in 2009, 1996 and 1993, while The Sunday Telegraph won the same award in 1999.\\nIts investigation on the 2009 expenses scandal was named the \"Scoop of the Year\" in 2009, with William Lewis winning \"Journalist of the Year\". The Telegraph won \"Team of the Year\" in 2004 for its coverage of the Iraq War. The paper also won \"Columnist of the Year\" three years\\' running from 2002 to 2004: Zoë Heller (2002), Robert Harris (2003) and Boris Johnson (2004).\\n\\nCharity and fundraising work\\nIn 1979, following a letter in The Daily Telegraph and a Government report highlighting the shortfall in care available for premature babies, Bliss, the special care baby charity, was founded. In 2009, as part of the Bliss 30th birthday celebrations, the charity was chosen as one of four beneficiaries of the newspaper\\'s Christmas Charity Appeal. In February 2010, a cheque was presented to Bliss for £120,000.The newspaper runs a charity appeal every Christmas, choosing different charities each year. In 2009, £1.2 million was raised.\\n\\nCriticisms\\nAccusation of news coverage influence by advertisers\\nIn July 2014, the Daily Telegraph was criticised for carrying links on its website to pro-Kremlin articles supplied by a Russian state-funded publication that downplayed any Russian involvement in the downing of the passenger jet Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. These had featured on its website as part of a commercial deal, but were later removed. The paper is paid £900,000 a year to include the supplement Russia Beyond the Headlines, a publication sponsored by the Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the Russian government\\'s official newspaper. It is paid a further £750,000 a year for a similar arrangement with the Chinese state in relation to the pro-Beijing China Watch advertising supplement.In February 2015, the chief political commentator of the Daily Telegraph, Peter Oborne, resigned. Oborne accused the paper of a \"form of fraud on its readers\" for its coverage of the bank HSBC in relation to a Swiss tax-dodging scandal that was widely covered by other news media. He alleged that editorial decisions about news content had been heavily influenced by the advertising arm of the newspaper because of commercial interests. Professor Jay Rosen at New York University stated that Oborne\\'s resignation statement was \"one of the most important things a journalist has written about journalism lately\".Oborne cited other instances of advertising strategy influencing the content of articles, linking the refusal to take an editorial stance on the repression of democratic demonstrations in Hong Kong to the Telegraph\\'s support from China. Additionally, he said that favourable reviews of the Cunard cruise liner Queen Mary II appeared in the Telegraph, noting: \"On 10 May last year The Telegraph ran a long feature on Cunard\\'s Queen Mary II liner on the news review page. This episode looked to many like a plug for an advertiser on a page normally dedicated to serious news analysis. I again checked and certainly Telegraph competitors did not view Cunard\\'s liner as a major news story. Cunard is an important Telegraph advertiser.\" In response, the Telegraph called Oborne\\'s statement an \"astonishing and unfounded attack, full of inaccuracy and innuendo\".In January 2017, the Telegraph Media Group had a higher number of upheld complaints than any other UK newspaper by its regulator IPSO. Most of these findings pertained to inaccuracy, as with other UK newspapers.In October 2017, a number of major western news organisations whose coverage had irked Beijing were excluded from Xi Jinping\\'s speech event launching a new politburo. However, the Daily Telegraph had been granted an invitation to the event.In April 2019, Business Insider reported The Telegraph had partnered with Facebook to publish articles \"downplaying \\'technofears\\' and praising the company\".\\n\\nPremature obituaries\\nThe paper published premature obituaries for Cockie Hoogterp, the second wife of Baron Blixen, Dave Swarbrick in 1999, and Dorothy Southworth Ritter, the widow of Tex Ritter and mother of John Ritter, in August 2001.\\n\\nIslamic Extremism and Scout Groups\\nIn January 2019, the paper published an article written by Camilla Tominey titled \"Police called in after Scout group run from mosque is linked to Islamic extremist and Holocaust denier\" in which it was reported that the police were investigating Ahammed Hussain, the Leader of the Scout Group at the Lewisham Islamic Centre, because he had links to extremist Muslim groups that promoted terrorism and antisemitism.\\nIn January 2020 the paper issued an official apology and accepted that the article contained many falsehoods, and that Hussain had never supported or promoted terrorism, or been anti-Semitic. The paper paid Hussain damages and costs. In their apology they said: \"The article was published by our client following receipt of information in good faith from the Scout Association and the Henry Jackson Society; nevertheless our client now accepts that the article (using that expression to refer to both print and online versions) is defamatory of your client and will apologise to him for publishing it.\"\\n\\nChina Watch\\nIn 2016, the Hong Kong Free Press reported that The Daily Telegraph was receiving £750,000 annually to carry a supplement called \\'China Watch\\' as part of a commercial deal with Chinese state-run newspaper China Daily. The Telegraph published the supplement once a month in print, and published it online at least until March 2020. As of April 2020, The Telegraph appeared to have removed China Watch from its website, along with another advertisement feature section by a Chinese state-run media outlet titled \"People\\'s Daily Online\". This followed the People\\'s Daily Online section carrying misinformation about COVID-19, including claims that traditional Chinese medicine could help fight the virus.The Guardian reported in 2018 that the China Watch newspaper supplement was being carried by The Telegraph along with other newspapers of record such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Le Figaro.\\n\\nCOVID-19 conspiracy theories\\nIn January 2021 British press regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation ordered The Daily Telegraph to publish corrections for a \"significantly misleading\" article published by Toby Young in July 2020 article \"When we have herd immunity Boris will face a reckoning on this pointless and damaging lockdown\" which spread COVID-19 conspiracy theories that the common cold provided \"natural immunity\" to COVID-19 and that London was \"probably approaching herd immunity\".\\n\\nNotable people\\nEditors\\nNotable columnists and journalists\\nDavid Eimer, foreign correspondent\\nBoris Johnson, former Brussels correspondent\\nWilliam Hague, columnist\\nMichael Deacon, columnist\\nCharles Moore, columnist\\nKatharine Birbalsingh, columnist\\nRoger Highfield, former science editor\\nHerbert Hughes, music critic, 1911–1932\\nAnthony Loyd, one-time war correspondent\\nJ.

              " 'The Firm (1993 film)': 'The Firm is a 1993 American legal thriller film directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Tom Cruise, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook and David Strathairn. The film is based on the 1991 novel The Firm by author John Grisham. The Firm was one of two films released in 1993 that were adapted from a Grisham novel, the other being The Pelican Brief.\\nReleased on June 30, 1993, the film was a major commercial success, grossing $270.2 million against a budget of $42 million, making it the highest grossing film adapted from a Grisham novel and the highest-grossing R-rated film of 1993, and received positive reviews for the performances (particularly from Hunter), although the screenplay received some criticism. Holly Hunter was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, while Dave Grusin was nominated for Best Original Score.\\n\\nPlot\\nMitch McDeere, about to graduate near the top of his class from Harvard Law School, accepts a generous job offer from Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a boutique law firm in Memphis, Tennessee. Mitch and his wife Abby move to Memphis, and he studies to pass the Tennessee bar exam. Senior partner Avery Tolar mentors Mitch and introduces him to the firm\\'s professional culture, which demands strict loyalty, confidentiality, and a willingness to charge exceptional fees. Mitch is seduced by the money and perks – including a house, new car, and his student loans paid off – but Abby is suspicious of the firm\\'s interference with employees’ families.\\nMitch passes the bar exam and begins working long hours, straining his marriage. Working closely with Avery, Mitch learns that most of the firm\\'s work involves helping wealthy clients hide money in off-shore shell corporations and other dubious tax-avoidance schemes. During a working trip to the Cayman Islands, Mitch hears a client state that the firm\\'s Chicago clients break people\\'s legs, and finds suspicious documents in a locked closet at Avery\\'s vacation house relating to four of the firm\\'s associates who died under suspicious circumstances. While in the Caymans, Mitch is seduced by a local sex worker.  The seduction had been prearranged by the firm\\'s security chief, Bill DeVasher, who uses photos of the tryst to blackmail Mitch into keeping quiet about the firm\\'s activities, threatening to send the photos to Abby.  In response, Mitch hires private investigator Eddie Lomax to investigate the associates\\' death.  Lomax is then fatally shot by two hit-men in his office, a murder witnessed by his secretary Tammy.\\nMitch is approached by FBI agents who reveal that BL&L\\'s biggest client is the Morolto crime family of the Chicago Outfit. Most of the firm is complicit in a massive tax fraud and money laundering scheme. The dead associates had learned the truth and were killed on the firm’s orders, as was Lomax. The FBI warns Mitch that his house, car, and office are probably bugged, and pressures him to provide evidence against the firm and the Moroltos. Mitch agrees to cooperate in return for $1.5 million and the release of his brother Ray, who is serving time in an Arkansas prison. The FBI orders Ray\\'s release, planning to return him to prison once Mitch hands over the incriminating files, and gives him half the money. Mitch confesses his one-night stand in the Caymans to Abby, who prepares to leave him.\\nWhen a client complains that he was billed for several hours of extra fees, Mitch realizes that mailing clients these padded bills is mail fraud, exposing the firm to RICO charges. He secretly copies the firm\\'s billing records with help from Tammy, but needs files from Avery’s house in the Caymans. Avery invites Abby to come with him to the Caymans and she declines, but he reveals his work schedule has changed, threatening Mitch\\'s plans. Telling Tammy not to inform Mitch, Abby flies to the Caymans to seduce and drug Avery. The firm\\'s phone tap picks up Abby\\'s warning to Tammy, and DeVasher sends his hitmen to the Caymans. After Abby and Tammy steal, copy, and return the files, a drowsy Avery tells Abby that the firm arranged for Mitch\\'s mistress to seduce him. He warns Abby to leave, and later drowns in the bathtub.\\nMitch\\'s plans are jeopardized when a prison guard on the Moroltos\\' payroll alerts DeVasher after Ray is transferred to FBI custody without the usual formalities. Fleeing from DeVasher and his gunmen, Mitch enters a building where DeVasher inadvertently shoots a hitman dead before Mitch blindsides him and beats him to death. Mitch meets with the Moroltos, presenting himself as a loyal attorney looking out for his clients\\' interests. He claims that his contact with the FBI and his copying of files were an attempt to expose the firm\\'s illegal over-billing, and asks the Moroltos for permission to turn over their billing invoices to help the FBI’s case against the firm. Revealing that he has made his own copies, he assures them that as long as he is alive, any information he knows about their legal affairs is safe under attorney-client privilege. Guaranteeing Mitch\\'s safety, the Moroltos reluctantly let him give the FBI the evidence it needs to prosecute the firm. Since the Moroltos were not tied to the mail fraud operations and attorney-client privilege does not apply when a lawyer knows about ongoing criminal activity, Mitch is able to continue his legal career, and reconciles with Abby.\\nThe FBI is furious that Mitch bailed the Moroltos out, but Mitch reminds them that the evidence he provided falls under RICO\\'s jurisdiction and can all but guarantee every senior member of the firm going to prison for decades. The film ends as the McDeeres return to Boston, driving the same well-used car in which they arrived in Memphis, while Ray, having been given the $750,000 Mitch obtained from the FBI by Tammy, enjoys his new life in the Caymans.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nPrincipal photography took place from November 9, 1992 to March 20, 1993 and though it was primarily filmed in Memphis, Tennessee, some scenes were filmed in Marion, Arkansas and the Cayman Islands.\\nThe film\\'s soundtrack is almost exclusively solo piano by Dave Grusin.\\nGene Hackman\\'s name did not appear on the film\\'s release poster. Hackman joined the film late, when it was already well into production, because the producers had originally wanted to change the gender of the character and cast Meryl Streep, until author John Grisham objected and Hackman was eventually cast. Tom Cruise\\'s deal with Paramount already stated that only his name could appear above the title. Hackman also wanted his name to appear above the title, but when this was refused he asked for his name to be removed completely from the poster. Hackman\\'s name does appear in the beginning and end credits.\\nThis is also the final film for Steven Hill and John Beal.\\n\\nDifferences from the novel\\nThe film accords with the book in most respects, but the ending is significantly different. Mitch does not end up in the Caribbean, as in the book; he and Abby simply get into their car and drive back to Boston.\\nA more fundamental difference from the book is the motives and manner in which Mitch solves his predicament. In the book, Mitch acknowledges to himself that he is breaking the attorney-client privilege by copying information and giving it to the FBI. In most US states this privilege only applies to crimes that have already been committed. The privilege does not apply if a lawyer knows that his client either is committing or will commit a crime.  However, Mitch must disclose information about his legitimate clients as well.  Accepting that he will likely not be allowed to practice law anywhere again, he swindles $10 million from the Firm, along with receiving $1 million of a promised $2 million from the FBI for his cooperation. After an extended manhunt involving the police, the firm\\'s lawyers, and hired thugs from the Morolto family, Mitch escapes with Abby (and his brother Ray) to the Cayman Islands.  Before fleeing, he leaves behind detailed records of the firm\\'s illegal activities, as well as a recorded deposition.  Mitch\\'s information gives federal prosecutors enough evidence to indict half of the Firm\\'s active lawyers right away, as well as several retired partners.  The documents also provide the FBI with circumstantial evidence of the Firm\\'s involvement in money laundering and tax fraud, and thus probable cause for a search warrant for the firm\\'s building and files.  This additional evidence is enough to smash both the firm and the Morolto family with a massive RICO indictment.\\nIn the film, apparently in order to preserve the protagonist\\'s personal integrity, Mitch exposes a systematic overbilling scheme by the firm, thus driving a wedge between the Moroltos (who in essence become complicit with Mitch) and their law firm (in the book, overbilling only received a brief mention). He receives a smaller amount of money from the FBI, which he gives to Ray, allowing him to disappear.  Rather than capitalizing on his circumstances by stealing money from the Firm, as in the book, the movie\\'s McDeere ends up battered and bruised, but with his integrity and professional ethics intact. Mitch also makes the FBI have to work in order to bring down the firm by having to argue that each instance of excessive billing is a federal offense (by virtue of the excessive bills being sent through the mail).  The volume and frequency meet the criteria for RICO, thereby enabling the FBI to effectively put the Firm out of business by seizing its property and equipment and freezing its bank accounts. From here the Moroltos would then need to find another law firm willing to take them on as clients, and if they couldn\\'t, charges for non-lodgment of tax returns could be brought.  Since Mitch is exposing only illegal activity, he is able to retain his law license.\\nInstead of a BMW, Mitch gets a Mercedes-Benz for joining the firm.\\nAvery Tolar was originally Avery Tolleson; the latest version of the novel uses the film\\'s surname. Tolar is portrayed as a sort of reluctant villain in the film, while in the novel he has no such moral conflicts.\\nThe surname of the second man killed on Grand Cayman is Joe Hodges, instead of Hodge as in the novel.\\nMitch\\'s confession to Abby about his sexual infidelity was also unique to the film. In the novel, McDeere never tells Abby about his infidelity. In the book, Abby\\'s not knowing about Mitch\\'s infidelity is a major \"suspense\" piece. Mitch comes home one evening and finds an envelope addressed to Abby, that has \"Photos – Do Not Bend\" written on it. The photos were surreptitiously given to DeVasher by Art Germain. Mitch thinks it is the pictures he was shown of his infidelity overseas. Abby is in the bedroom when he sees the open package. He enters the bedroom and learns that Abby opened the package, but it was empty. Mitch realizes DeVasher is toying with him, and this incident in the book causes Mitch to cooperate with the FBI.  In the film, Mitch\\'s confession prompts Abby to seriously consider leaving him, but she ultimately helps him bring down the firm.\\nAlso, in the book, Eddie\\'s old secretary, Tammy, seduces and drugs Avery.  In the movie, however, it is Abby who seduces Avery.  This also changes the character development because in the movie Abby is portrayed as risking herself for Mitch. In the book, Abby is simply an accomplice to Tammy.\\nIn the novel, a dirty FBI agent betrays McDeere to let the firm know about the deal. In the movie, a prison guard alerts the firm to Ray McDeere\\'s release, alerting them that Mitch McDeere cut a deal with the FBI.\\n\\nRelease\\nThe film was released while Grisham was at the height of his popularity. That week, Grisham and Michael Crichton evenly divided the top six paperback spots on The New York Times Best Seller list. It opened on June 30, 1993 in 2,393 theatres, and landed at #1 at the box office, grossing $25.4 million over the 4th of July weekend. It remained in the #1 spot at the box office for 3 weeks. After 12 weeks in theatres, the film was a huge success, making over $158 million domestically and $111 million internationally ($270 million worldwide). Additionally, it was the largest grossing R-rated movie of 1993 and of any film based on a Grisham novel.\\n\\nAwards\\nThe film earned two Academy Award nominations including Best Supporting Actress for Holly Hunter (losing to Anna Paquin for The Piano, though she did win an Oscar at that year\\'s ceremony for Best Actress in the same film as Paquin) and Best Original Score for Dave Grusin (losing to John Williams for Schindler\\'s List).\\n\\nReception\\nCritical reaction to The Firm has been mostly positive, with the film earning a 75% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 57 reviews, with an average of 6.20/10. The site\\'s consensus states: \"The Firm is a big studio thriller that amusingly tears apart the last of 1980s boardroom culture and the false securities it represented.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.Roger Ebert gave The Firm three stars out of four, remarking: \"The movie is virtually an anthology of good small character performances. [...] The large gallery of characters makes The Firm into a convincing canvas [... but] with a screenplay that developed the story more clearly, this might have been a superior movie, instead of just a good one with some fine performances.\"The film earned some negative reviews as well, notably from James Berardinelli, who said that \"[v]ery little of what made the written version so enjoyable has been successfully translated to the screen, and what we\\'re left with instead is an overly-long [and] pedantic thriller.\" Grisham enjoyed the film, remarking: \"I thought [Tom Cruise] did a good job. He played the innocent young associate very well.\"\\n\\nHome media\\nThe film was released on VHS in December 1993, the cassettes were specially made of blue plastic. The DVD was released on May 23, 2000. The special features include only the teaser and theatrical trailers. The Blu-ray was released on September 11, 2012.\\n\\nIn other media\\nTV sequel\\nIn April 2011 Entertainment One announced that a sequel to The Firm was being produced with Sony Pictures Television and Paramount Pictures. The series picked up the story of Mitch and his family ten years after the events of the novel and film. The first season was 22 episodes long and began production in Canada in July 2011. In May 2011, NBC confirmed that they had acquired the U.S. broadcast rights to the show and that they planned to début it in January 2012. The show was cancelled after its first season.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nThe Firm at IMDb\\nThe Firm at AllMovie\\nThe Firm at the TCM Movie Database\\nThe Firm at the American Film Institute Catalog\\nThe Firm at Box Office Mojo\\n\"The Firm: Blu-ray Review\" at HD-Report',\n",
              " 'The Guardian': 'The Guardian is a British daily newspaper. It was founded in 1821 as The Manchester Guardian, and changed its name in 1959. Along with its sister papers The Observer and The Guardian Weekly, The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group, owned by the Scott Trust. The trust was created in 1936 to \"secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference\". The trust was converted into a limited company in 2008, with a constitution written so as to maintain for The Guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators. Profits are reinvested in journalism rather than distributed to owners or shareholders.The editor-in-chief Katharine Viner succeeded Alan Rusbridger in 2015. Since 2018, the paper\\'s main newsprint sections have been published in tabloid format. As of February 2020, its print edition had a daily circulation of 126,879. The newspaper has an online edition, TheGuardian.com, as well as two international websites, Guardian Australia (founded in 2013) and Guardian US (founded in 2011). The paper\\'s readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion, and its reputation as a platform for social liberal and left-wing editorial has led to the use of the \"Guardian reader\" and \"Guardianista\" as often-pejorative epithets for those of left-leaning or \"politically correct\" tendencies. Frequent typographical errors during the age of manual typesetting led Private Eye magazine to dub the paper the \"Grauniad\" in the 1960s, a nickname still used occasionally by the editors for self-mockery.In an Ipsos MORI research poll in September 2018 designed to interrogate the public\\'s trust of specific titles online, The Guardian scored highest for digital-content news, with 84% of readers agreeing that they \"trust what [they] see in it\". A December 2018 report of a poll by the Publishers Audience Measurement Company (PAMCo) stated that the paper\\'s print edition was found to be the most trusted in the UK in the period from October 2017 to September 2018. It was also reported to be the most-read of the UK\\'s \"quality newsbrands\", including digital editions; other \"quality\" brands included The Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, and the i. While The Guardian\\'s print circulation is in decline, the report indicated that news from The Guardian, including that reported online, reaches more than 23 million UK adults each month.Chief among the notable \"scoops\" obtained by the paper was the 2011 News International phone-hacking scandal—and in particular the hacking of the murdered English teenager Milly Dowler\\'s phone. The investigation led to the closure of the News of the World, the UK\\'s best-selling Sunday newspaper and one of the highest-circulation newspapers in history. In June 2013, The Guardian broke news of the secret collection by the Obama administration of Verizon telephone records, and subsequently revealed the existence of the surveillance program PRISM after knowledge of it was leaked to the paper by the whistleblower and former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. In 2016, The Guardian led an investigation into the Panama Papers, exposing then–Prime Minister David Cameron\\'s links to offshore bank accounts. It has been named \"newspaper of the year\" four times at the annual British Press Awards: most recently in 2014, for its reporting on government surveillance.\\n\\nHistory\\n1821 to 1972\\nEarly years\\nThe Manchester Guardian was founded in Manchester in 1821 by cotton merchant John Edward Taylor with backing from the Little Circle, a group of non-conformist businessmen. They launched the paper after the police closure of the more radical Manchester Observer, a paper that had championed the cause of the Peterloo Massacre protesters. Taylor had been hostile to the radical reformers, writing: \"They have appealed not to the reason but the passions and the suffering of their abused and credulous fellow-countrymen, from whose ill-requited industry they extort for themselves the means of a plentiful and comfortable existence. They do not toil, neither do they spin, but they live better than those that do.\" When the government closed down the Manchester Observer, the mill-owners\\' champions had the upper hand.The influential journalist Jeremiah Garnett joined Taylor during the establishment of the paper, and all of the Little Circle wrote articles for the new paper. The prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that it would \"zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty [...] warmly advocate the cause of Reform [...] endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy and [...] support, without reference to the party from which they emanate, all serviceable measures\". In 1825, the paper merged with the British Volunteer and was known as The Manchester Guardian and British Volunteer until 1828.The working-class Manchester and Salford Advertiser called The Manchester Guardian \"the foul prostitute and dirty parasite of the worst portion of the mill-owners\". The Manchester Guardian was generally hostile to labour\\'s claims. Of the 1832 Ten Hours Bill, the paper doubted whether in view of the foreign competition \"the passing of a law positively enacting a gradual destruction of the cotton manufacture in this kingdom would be a much less rational procedure.\" The Manchester Guardian dismissed strikes as the work of outside agitators: \"[…] if an accommodation can be effected, the occupation of the agents of the Union is gone. They live on strife [...].\"\\n\\nSlavery and the American Civil War\\nThe newspaper opposed slavery and supported free trade. An 1823 leading article on the continuing \"cruelty and injustice\" to slaves in the West Indies long after the abolition of the slave trade with the Slave Trade Act 1807 wanted fairness to the interests and claims both of the planters and of their oppressed slaves. It welcomed the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 and accepted the \"increased compensation\" to the planters as the \"guilt of slavery attaches far more to the nation\" rather than individuals. Success of the Act would encourage emancipation in other slave-owning nations to avoid \"imminent risk of a violent and bloody termination.\" However, the newspaper argued against restricting trade with countries which had not yet abolished slavery.Complex tensions developed in the United States. When the abolitionist George Thompson toured, the newspaper said that \"[s]lavery is a monstrous evil, but civil war is not a less one; and we would not seek the abolition even of the former through the imminent hazard of the latter\". It suggested that the United States should compensate slave-owners for freeing slaves and called on President Franklin Pierce to resolve the 1856 \"civil war\", the Sacking of Lawrence due to pro-slavery laws imposed by Congress.In 1860, The Observer quoted a report that the newly elected president Abraham Lincoln was opposed to abolition of slavery. On 13 May 1861, shortly after the start of the American Civil War, the Manchester Guardian portrayed the Northern states as primarily imposing a burdensome trade monopoly on the Confederate States, arguing that if the South was freed to have direct trade with Europe, \"the day would not be distant when slavery itself would cease\". Therefore, the newspaper asked \"Why should the South be prevented from freeing itself from slavery?\" This hopeful view was also held by the Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone.\\n\\nThere was division in Britain over the Civil War, even within political parties. The Manchester Guardian had also been conflicted. It had supported other independence movements and felt it should also support the rights of the Confederacy to self-determination. It criticised Lincoln\\'s Emancipation Proclamation for not freeing all American slaves. On 10 October 1862, it wrote: \"It is impossible to cast any reflections upon a man so evidently sincere and well-intentioned as Mr Lincoln but it is also impossible not to feel that it was an evil day both for America and the world, when he was chosen President of the United States\". By then, the Union blockade was causing suffering in British towns. Some including Liverpool supported the Confederacy as did  \"current opinion in all classes\" in London. On 31 December 1862, cotton workers held a meeting at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester which resolved \"its detestation of negro slavery in America, and of the attempt of the rebellious Southern slave-holders to organise on the great American continent a nation having slavery as its basis\". There was a comment that \"an effort had been made in a leading article of the Manchester Guardian to deter the working men from assembling together for such a purpose\". The newspaper reported all this and published their letter to President Lincoln while complaining that \"the chief occupation, if not the chief object of the meeting, seems to have been to abuse the Manchester Guardian\". Lincoln replied to the letter thanking the workers for their \"sublime Christian heroism\" and American ships delivered relief supplies to Britain.The newspaper reported the shock to the community of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865, concluding that \"[t]he parting of his family with the dying President is too sad for description\", but in what from today\\'s perspective looks an ill-judged editorial wrote that \"[o]f his rule we can never speak except as a series of acts abhorrent to every true notion of constitutional right and human liberty\", adding \"it is doubtless to be regretted that he had not the opportunity of vindicating his good intentions\".According to Martin Kettle, writing for The Guardian in February 2011, \"The Guardian had always hated slavery. But it doubted the Union hated slavery to the same degree. It argued that the Union had always tacitly condoned slavery by shielding the southern slave states from the condemnation they deserved. It was critical of Lincoln\\'s emancipation proclamation for stopping short of a full repudiation of slavery throughout the US. And it chastised the president for being so willing to negotiate with the south, with slavery one of the issues still on the table\".\\n\\nC. P. Scott\\nC. P. Scott made the newspaper nationally recognised. He was editor for 57 years from 1872, and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of Taylor\\'s son in 1907. Under Scott, the paper\\'s moderate editorial line became more radical, supporting William Gladstone when the Liberals split in 1886, and opposing the Second Boer War against popular opinion. Scott supported the movement for women\\'s suffrage, but was critical of any tactics by the Suffragettes that involved direct action: \"The really ludicrous position is that Mr Lloyd George is fighting to enfranchise seven million women and the militants are smashing unoffending people\\'s windows and breaking up benevolent societies\\' meetings in a desperate effort to prevent him.\" Scott thought the Suffragettes\\' \"courage and devotion\" was \"worthy of a better cause and saner leadership\". It has been argued that Scott\\'s criticism reflected a widespread disdain, at the time, for those women who \"transgressed the gender expectations of Edwardian society\".Scott commissioned J. M. Synge and his friend Jack Yeats to produce articles and drawings documenting the social conditions of the west of Ireland; these pieces were published in 1911 in the collection Travels in Wicklow, West Kerry and Connemara.Scott\\'s friendship with Chaim Weizmann played a role in the Balfour Declaration of 1917. In 1948 The Manchester Guardian was a supporter of the new State of Israel.\\nIn 1919, the paper\\'s special correspondent W. T. Goode travelled to Moscow and secured interviews with Vladimir Lenin and other Soviet leaders.Ownership of the paper passed in June 1936 to the Scott Trust (named after the last owner, John Russell Scott, who was the first chairman of the Trust). This move ensured the paper\\'s independence.Sylvia Sprigge served as correspondent for The Manchester Guardian in Italy 1943–1953.From 1930 to 1967, a special archival copy of all the daily newspapers was preserved in 700 zinc cases. These were found in 1988 whilst the newspaper\\'s archives were deposited at the University of Manchester\\'s John Rylands University Library, on the Oxford Road campus. The first case was opened and found to contain the newspapers issued in August 1930 in pristine condition. The zinc cases had been made each month by the newspaper\\'s plumber and stored for posterity. The other 699 cases were not opened and were all returned to storage at The Guardian\\'s garage, owing to shortage of space at the library.\\n\\nSpanish Civil War\\nTraditionally affiliated with the centrist to centre-left Liberal Party, and with a northern, non-conformist circulation base, the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). George Orwell writes in Homage to Catalonia (1938): \"Of our larger papers, the Manchester Guardian is the only one that leaves me with an increased respect for its honesty\". With the pro-Liberal News Chronicle, the Labour-supporting Daily Herald, the Communist Party\\'s Daily Worker and several Sunday and weekly papers, it supported the Republican government against General Francisco Franco\\'s insurgent nationalists.\\n\\nPost-war\\nThe paper\\'s then editor, A. P. Wadsworth, so loathed Labour\\'s left-wing champion Aneurin Bevan, who had made a reference to getting rid of \"Tory Vermin\" in a speech \"and the hate-gospellers of his entourage\" that it encouraged readers to vote Conservative and remove Attlee\\'s post-war Labour government. The newspaper opposed the creation of the National Health Service as it feared the state provision of healthcare would \"eliminate selective elimination\" and lead to an increase of congenitally deformed and feckless people.The Manchester Guardian strongly opposed military intervention during the 1956 Suez Crisis: \"The Anglo-French ultimatum to Egypt is an act of folly, without justification in any terms but brief expediency. It pours petrol on a growing fire. There is no knowing what kind of explosion will follow.\"On 24 August 1959, The Manchester Guardian changed its name to The Guardian. This change reflected the growing prominence of national and international affairs in the newspaper. In September 1961, The Guardian, which had previously only been published in Manchester, began to be printed in London.\\n\\n1972 to 2000\\nNorthern Ireland conflict\\nWhen 13 civil rights demonstrators in Northern Ireland were killed by British soldiers on 30 January 1972 (known as Bloody Sunday), The Guardian said that \"Neither side can escape condemnation.\" Of the protesters, they wrote, \"The organizers of the demonstration, Miss Bernadette Devlin among them, deliberately challenged the ban on marches. They knew that stone throwing and sniping could not be prevented, and that the IRA might use the crowd as a shield.\" Of the army, they wrote, \"there seems little doubt that random shots were fired into the crowd, that aim was taken at individuals who were neither bombers nor weapons carriers and that excessive force was used\".Many Irish people believed that the Widgery Tribunal\\'s ruling on the killings was a whitewash, a view that was later supported with the publication of the Saville inquiry in 2010, but in 1972 The Guardian declared that \"Widgery\\'s report is not one-sided\" (20 April 1972). At the time the paper also supported internment without trial in Northern Ireland: \"Internment without trial is hateful, repressive and undemocratic. In the existing Irish situation, most regrettably, it is also inevitable... .To remove the ringleaders, in the hope that the atmosphere might calm down, is a step to which there is no obvious alternative.\" Before then, The Guardian had called for British troops to be sent to the region: British soldiers could \"present a more disinterested face of law and order,\" but only on condition that \"Britain takes charge.\"\\n\\nSarah Tisdall\\nIn 1983 the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of cruise missiles in Britain that were leaked to The Guardian by civil servant Sarah Tisdall. The paper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities, which resulted in a six-month prison sentence for Tisdall, though she served only four. \"I still blame myself,\" said Peter Preston, who was the editor of The Guardian at the time, but he went on to argue that the paper had no choice because it \"believed in the rule of law\". In an article discussing Julian Assange and the protection of sources by journalists, John Pilger criticised The Guardian\\'s editor for betraying Tisdall by choosing not to go to prison \"on a fundamental principle of protecting a source\".\\n\\nAlleged penetration by Russian intelligence\\nIn 1994, KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky identified Guardian literary editor Richard Gott as \"an agent of influence\". While Gott denied that he received cash, he admitted he had had lunch at the Soviet Embassy and had taken benefits from the KGB on overseas visits. Gott resigned from his post.Gordievsky commented on the newspaper: \"The KGB loved The Guardian. It was deemed highly susceptible to penetration.\"\\n\\nJonathan Aitken\\nIn 1995, both the Granada Television programme World in Action and The Guardian were sued for libel by the then cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken, for their allegation that Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed had paid for Aitken and his wife to stay at the Hôtel Ritz in Paris, which would have amounted to accepting a bribe on Aitken\\'s part. Aitken publicly stated that he would fight with \"the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play\". The court case proceeded, and in 1997 The Guardian produced evidence that Aitken\\'s claim of his wife paying for the hotel stay was untrue. In 1999, Aitken was jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice.\\n\\nConnection\\nIn May 1998, a series of Guardian investigations exposed the wholesale fabrication of a much-garlanded ITV documentary The Connection, produced by Carlton Television.\\nThe documentary purported to film an undiscovered route by which heroin was smuggled into the United Kingdom from Colombia. An internal inquiry at Carlton found that The Guardian\\'s allegations were in large part correct and the then industry regulator, the ITC, punished Carlton with a record £2-million fine for multiple breaches of the UK\\'s broadcasting codes. The scandal led to an impassioned debate about the accuracy of documentary production.Later in June 1998, The Guardian revealed further fabrications in another Carlton documentary from the same director.\\n\\nKosovo War\\nThe paper supported NATO\\'s military intervention in the Kosovo War in 1998–1999. The Guardian stated that \"the only honourable course for Europe and America is to use military force\". Mary Kaldor\\'s piece was headlined \"Bombs away! But to save civilians, we must get in some soldiers too.\"\\n\\nSince 2000\\nIn the early 2000s, The Guardian challenged the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Treason Felony Act 1848. In October 2004, The Guardian published a humorous column by Charlie Brooker in its entertainment guide, the final sentence of which was viewed by some as a call for violence against U.S. President George W. Bush; after a controversy, Brooker and the paper issued an apology, saying the \"closing comments were intended as an ironic joke, not as a call to action.\" Following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, The Guardian published an article on its comment pages by Dilpazier Aslam, a 27-year-old British Muslim and journalism trainee from Yorkshire. Aslam was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamist group, and had published a number of articles on their website. According to the paper, it did not know that Aslam was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir when he applied to become a trainee, though several staff members were informed of this once he started at the paper. The Home Office has claimed the group\\'s \"ultimate aim is the establishment of an Islamic state (Caliphate), according to Hizb ut-Tahrir via non-violent means\". The Guardian asked Aslam to resign his membership of the group and, when he did not do so, terminated his employment. In early 2009, the paper started a tax investigation into a number of major UK companies, including publishing a database of the tax paid by the FTSE 100 companies. Internal documents relating to Barclays Bank\\'s tax avoidance were removed from The Guardian website after Barclays obtained a gagging order. The paper played a pivotal role in exposing the depth of the News of the World phone hacking affair. The Economist\\'s Intelligent Life magazine opined that... As Watergate is to the Washington Post, and thalidomide to the Sunday Times, so phone-hacking will surely be to The Guardian: a defining moment in its history.\\n\\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict coverage\\nIn recent decades The Guardian has been accused of biased criticism of Israeli government policy and of bias against the Palestinians. In December 2003, columnist Julie Burchill cited \"striking bias against the state of Israel\" as one of the reasons she left the paper for The Times.Responding to these accusations, a Guardian editorial in 2002 condemned antisemitism and defended the paper\\'s right to criticise the policies and actions of the Israeli government, arguing that those who view such criticism as inherently anti-Jewish are mistaken. Harriet Sherwood, then The Guardian\\'s foreign editor, later its Jerusalem correspondent, has also denied that The Guardian has an anti-Israel bias, saying that the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.On 6 November 2011, Chris Elliott, The Guardian\\'s readers\\' editor, wrote that \"Guardian reporters, writers and editors must be more vigilant about the language they use when writing about Jews or Israel,\" citing recent cases where The Guardian received complaints regarding language chosen to describe Jews or Israel. Elliott noted that, over nine months, he upheld complaints regarding language in certain articles that were seen as anti-Semitic, revising the language and footnoting this change.The Guardian\\'s style guide section referred to Tel Aviv as the capital of Israel in 2012. The Guardian later clarified: \"In 1980, the Israeli Knesset enacted a law designating the city of Jerusalem, including East Jerusalem, as the country\\'s capital. In response, the UN security council issued resolution 478, censuring the \"change in character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem\" and calling on all member states with diplomatic missions in the city to withdraw. The UN has reaffirmed this position on several occasions, and almost every country now has its embassy in Tel Aviv. While it was therefore right to issue a correction to make clear Israel\\'s designation of Jerusalem as its capital is not recognised by the international community, we accept that it is wrong to state that Tel Aviv – the country\\'s financial and diplomatic centre – is the capital. The style guide has been amended accordingly.\"On 11 August 2014 the print edition of The Guardian published a pro-Israeli advocacy advert during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict featuring Elie Wiesel, headed by the words \"Jews rejected child sacrifice 3,500 years ago. Now it\\'s Hamas\\' turn.\" The Times had decided against running the ad, although it had already appeared in major American newspapers. One week later, Chris Elliott expressed the opinion that the newspaper should have rejected the language used in the advert and should have negotiated with the advertiser on this matter.\\n\\nClark County\\nIn August 2004, for the US presidential election, the daily G2 supplement launched an experimental letter-writing campaign in Clark County, Ohio, an average-sized county in a swing state. Editor Ian Katz bought a voter list from the county for $25 and asked readers to write to people listed as undecided in the election, giving them an impression of the international view and the importance of voting against President George W. Bush. Katz admitted later that he did not believe Democrats who warned that the campaign would benefit Bush and not opponent John Kerry. The newspaper scrapped \"Operation Clark County\" on 21 October 2004 after first publishing a column of responses—nearly all of them outraged—to the campaign under the headline \"Dear Limey assholes\". Some commentators suggested that the public\\'s dislike of the campaign contributed to Bush\\'s victory in Clark County.\\n\\nGuardian America and Guardian US\\nIn 2007, the paper launched Guardian America, an attempt to capitalise on its large online readership in the United States, which at the time stood at more than 5.9 million. The company hired former American Prospect editor, New York magazine columnist and New York Review of Books writer Michael Tomasky to head the project and hire a staff of American reporters and web editors. The site featured news from The Guardian that was relevant to an American audience: coverage of US news and the Middle East, for example.Tomasky stepped down from his position as editor of Guardian America in February 2009, ceding editing and planning duties to other US and London staff. He retained his position as a columnist and blogger, taking the title editor-at-large.In October 2009, the company abandoned the Guardian America homepage, instead directing users to a US news index page on the main Guardian website. The following month, the company laid off six American employees, including a reporter, a multimedia producer and four web editors. The move came as Guardian News and Media opted to reconsider its US strategy amid a huge effort to cut costs across the company. In subsequent years, however, The Guardian has hired various commentators on US affairs including Ana Marie Cox, Michael Wolff, Naomi Wolf, Glenn Greenwald and George W. Bush\\'s former speechwriter Josh Treviño. Treviño\\'s first blog post was an apology for a controversial tweet posted in June 2011 over the second Gaza flotilla, the controversy which had been revived by the appointment.Guardian US launched in September 2011, led by editor-in-chief Janine Gibson, which replaced the previous Guardian America service. After a period during which Katharine Viner served as the US editor-in-chief before taking charge of Guardian News and Media as a whole, Viner\\'s former deputy, Lee Glendinning, was appointed to succeed her as head of the American operation at the beginning of June 2015.\\n\\nGagged from reporting Parliament\\nIn October 2009, The Guardian reported that it was forbidden to report on a parliamentary matter – a question recorded in a Commons order paper, to be answered by a minister later that week. The paper noted that it was being \"forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented—for the first time in memory—from reporting parliament. Legal obstacles, which cannot be identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned, on behalf of a client who must remain secret. The only fact The Guardian can report is that the case involves the London solicitors Carter-Ruck.\" The paper further claimed that this case appears \"to call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1689 Bill of Rights\". The only parliamentary question mentioning Carter-Ruck in the relevant period was by Paul Farrelly MP, in reference to legal action by Barclays and Trafigura. The part of the question referencing Carter-Ruck relates to the latter company\\'s September 2009 gagging order on the publication of a 2006 internal report into the 2006 Côte d\\'Ivoire toxic waste dump scandal, which involved a class action case that the company only settled in September 2009 after The Guardian published some of the commodity trader\\'s internal emails. The reporting injunction was lifted the next day, for Carter-Ruck withdrew it before The Guardian could challenge it in the High Court. Alan Rusbridger attributed the rapid back-down by Carter-Ruck to postings on Twitter, as did a BBC article.\\n\\nEdward Snowden leaks and intervention by the UK government\\nIn June 2013, the newspaper broke news of the secret collection of Verizon telephone records held by Barack Obama\\'s administration and subsequently revealed the existence of the PRISM surveillance program after it was leaked to the paper by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The newspaper was subsequently contacted by the British government\\'s Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, under instruction from Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who ordered that the hard drives containing the information be destroyed. The Guardian\\'s offices were then visited in July by agents from the UK\\'s GCHQ, who supervised the destruction of the hard drives containing information acquired from Snowden. In June 2014, The Register reported that the information the government sought to suppress by destroying the hard drives related to the location of a \"beyond top secret\" internet monitoring base in Seeb, Oman, and the close involvement of BT and Cable & Wireless in intercepting internet communications. Julian Assange criticised the newspaper for not publishing the entirety of the content when it had the chance. Rusbridger had initially proceeded without the government\\'s supervision, but subsequently sought it, and established an ongoing relationship with the Defence Ministry. The Guardian enquiry later continued because the information had already been copied outside the United Kingdom, earning the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize. Rusbridger and subsequent chief editors would sit on the government\\'s DSMA-notice board.\\n\\nManafort–Assange secret meetings\\nIn a November 2018 Guardian article, Luke Harding and Dan Collyns cited anonymous sources which stated that Donald Trump\\'s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret meetings with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2013, 2015, and 2016. One reporter characterized the story, \"If it\\'s right, it might be the biggest get this year. If it\\'s wrong, it might be the biggest gaffe.\" Manafort and Assange both denied ever having met with the latter threatening legal action against The Guardian. Ecuador\\'s London consul Fidel Narváez, who had worked at Ecuador\\'s embassy in London from 2010 to July 2018, denied that Manafort\\'s visits had happened.\\n\\nPriti Patel cartoon\\nThe Guardian was accused of being \"racist and misogynistic\" after it published a cartoon depicting Home Secretary, Priti Patel as a cow with a ring in its nose in an alleged reference to her Hindu faith, since cows are considered sacred in Hinduism.\\n\\nWikiLeaks coverage\\nJournalist Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept, a former contributor to The Guardian, has accused The Guardian of falsifying the words of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in a report about the interview he gave to Italian newspaper La Repubblica. Greenwald wrote: \"This article is about how those [Guardian\\'s] false claims—fabrications, really—were spread all over the internet by journalists, causing hundreds of thousands of people (if not millions) to consume false news.\" The Guardian later amended its article about Assange.After publishing a story on 13 January 2017 claiming that WhatsApp had a \"backdoor [that] allows snooping on messages\", more than 70 professional cryptographers signed on to an open letter calling for The Guardian to retract the article. On 13 June 2017, editor Paul Chadwick released an article detailing the flawed reporting in the original January article, which was amended to remove references to a backdoor.\\n\\nOwnership and finances\\nThe Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group (GMG) of newspapers, radio stations and print media, including; The Observer Sunday newspaper, The Guardian Weekly international newspaper, and new media—Guardian Abroad website, and guardian.co.uk. All the aforementioned were owned by The Scott Trust, a charitable foundation existing between 1936 and 2008, which aimed to ensure the paper\\'s editorial independence in perpetuity, maintaining its financial health in order to ensure it did not become vulnerable to takeovers by for-profit media groups. At the beginning of October 2008, the Scott Trust\\'s assets were transferred to a new limited company, The Scott Trust Limited, with the intention being that the original trust would be wound up. Dame Liz Forgan, chair of the Scott Trust, reassured staff that the purposes of the new company remained the same as under the previous arrangements.\\n\\nThe Guardian\\'s ownership by the Scott Trust is probably a factor in its being the only British national daily to conduct (since 2003) an annual social, ethical and environmental audit in which it examines, under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor, its own behaviour as a company. It is also the only British national daily newspaper to employ an internal ombudsman (called the \"readers\\' editor\") to handle complaints and corrections.\\nThe Guardian and its parent groups participate in Project Syndicate and intervened in 1995 to save the Mail & Guardian in South Africa. However, GMG sold the majority of its shares of the Mail & Guardian in 2002.The Guardian was consistently loss-making until 2019. The National Newspaper division of GMG, which also includes The Observer, reported operating losses of £49.9 million in 2006, up from £18.6 million in 2005. The paper was therefore heavily dependent on cross-subsidisation from profitable companies within the group.\\nThe continual losses made by the National Newspaper division of the Guardian Media Group caused it to dispose of its Regional Media division by selling titles to competitor Trinity Mirror in March 2010. This included the flagship Manchester Evening News, and severed the historic link between that paper and The Guardian. The sale was in order to safeguard the future of The Guardian newspaper as is the intended purpose of the Scott Trust.In June 2011 Guardian News and Media revealed increased annual losses of £33 million and announced that it was looking to focus on its online edition for news coverage, leaving the print edition to contain more comments and features. It was also speculated that The Guardian might become the first British national daily paper to be fully online.For the three years up to June 2012, the paper lost £100,000 a day, which prompted Intelligent Life to question whether The Guardian could survive.Between 2007 and 2014 The Guardian Media Group sold all their side businesses, of regional papers and online portals for classifieds and consolidated, into The Guardian as sole product. The sales let them acquire a capital stock of £838.3 million as of July 2014, supposed to guarantee the independence of the Guardian in perpetuity. In the first year, the paper made more losses than predicted, and in January 2016 the publishers announced, that The Guardian will cut 20 per cent of staff and costs within the next three years. The newspaper is rare in calling for direct contributions \"to deliver the independent journalism the world needs.\"The Guardian Media Group\\'s 2018 annual report (year ending 1 April 2018) indicated some significant changes occurring. Its digital (online) editions accounted for over 50% of group revenues by that time; the loss from news and media operations was £18.6 million, 52% lower than during the prior year (2017: £38.9 million). The Group had cut costs by £19.1 million, partly by switching its print edition to the tabloid format. The Guardian Media Group\\'s owner, the Scott Trust Endowment Fund, reported that its value at the time was £1.01 billion (2017: £1.03 billion). In the following financial report (for the year 2018/2019), the group reported a profit (EBITDA) of £0.8 million before exceptional items, thus breaking even in 2019.\\n\\n\"Membership\" subscription scheme\\nIn 2014, The Guardian launched a membership scheme. The scheme aims to reduce the financial losses incurred by The Guardian without introducing a paywall, thus maintaining open access to the website. Website readers can pay a monthly subscription, with three tiers available. As of 2018 this approach was considered successful, having brought more than 1 million subscriptions or donations, with the paper hoping to break even by April 2019.\\n\\nFoundation funding\\nIn 2016, the company established a U.S.-based philanthropic arm to raise money from individuals and organizations including think tanks and corporate foundations. The grants are focused by the donors on particular issues. By the following year, the organization had raised $1 million from the likes of Pierre Omidyar\\'s Humanity United, the Skoll Foundation, and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation to finance reporting on topics including modern-day slavery and climate change. The Guardian has stated that it has secured $6 million \"in multi-year funding commitments\" thus far.The new project developed from funding relationships which the paper already had with the Ford, Rockefeller, and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Gates had given the organization $5 million for its Global Development webpage.As of March 2020, the journal claims to be \"the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels.\"\\n\\nPolitical stance and editorial opinion\\nFounded by textile traders and merchants, in its early years The Guardian had a reputation as \"an organ of the middle class\", or in the words of C. P. Scott\\'s son Ted, \"a paper that will remain bourgeois to the last\". Associated at first with the Little Circle and hence with classical liberalism as expressed by the Whigs and later by the Liberal Party, its political orientation underwent a decisive change after World War II, leading to a gradual alignment with Labour and the political left in general.\\nThe Scott Trust describes one of its \"core purposes\" to be \"to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity: as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation; remaining faithful to its liberal tradition\". The paper\\'s readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion: a MORI poll taken between April and June 2000 showed that 80 per cent of Guardian readers were Labour Party voters; according to another MORI poll taken in 2005, 48 per cent of Guardian readers were Labour voters and 34 per cent Liberal Democrat voters. The newspaper\\'s reputation as a platform for liberal opinions has led to the use of the epithets \"Guardian reader\" and \"Guardianista\" for people holding such views, or as a stereotype of such people as middle class, earnest and politically correct.Although the paper is often considered to be \"linked inextricably\" to the Labour Party, three of The Guardian\\'s four leader writers joined the more centrist Social Democratic Party on its foundation in 1981. The paper was enthusiastic in its support for Tony Blair in his successful bid to lead the Labour Party, and to be elected Prime Minister. On 19 January 2003, two months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, an Observer Editorial said: \"Military intervention in the Middle East holds many dangers. But if we want a lasting peace it may be the only option. […] War with Iraq may yet not come, but, conscious of the potentially terrifying responsibility resting with the British Government, we find ourselves supporting the current commitment to a possible use of force.\" But The Guardian opposed the war, along with the Daily Mirror and The Independent.Then Guardian features editor Ian Katz asserted in 2004 that \"it is no secret we are a centre-left newspaper\". In 2008, Guardian columnist Jackie Ashley said that editorial contributors were a mix of \"right-of-centre libertarians, greens, Blairites, Brownites, Labourite but less enthusiastic Brownites, etc,\" and that the newspaper was \"clearly left of centre and vaguely progressive\". She also said that \"you can be absolutely certain that come the next general election, The Guardian\\'s stance will not be dictated by the editor, still less any foreign proprietor (it helps that there isn\\'t one) but will be the result of vigorous debate within the paper\". The paper\\'s comment and opinion pages, though often written by centre-left contributors such as Polly Toynbee, have allowed some space for right-of-centre voices such as Sir Max Hastings and Michael Gove. Since an editorial in 2000, The Guardian has favoured abolition of the British monarchy. \"I write for the Guardian,\" said Max Hastings in 2005, \"because it is read by the new establishment,\" reflecting the paper\\'s then-growing influence.\\nIn the run-up to the 2010 general election, following a meeting of the editorial staff, the paper declared its support for the Liberal Democrats, due in particular, to the party\\'s stance on electoral reform. The paper suggested tactical voting to prevent a Conservative victory, given Britain\\'s first-past-the-post electoral system. At the 2015 election, the paper switched its support to the Labour Party. The paper argued that Britain needed a new direction and Labour \"speaks with more urgency than its rivals on social justice, standing up to predatory capitalism, on investment for growth, on reforming and strengthening the public realm, Britain\\'s place in Europe and international development\".Assistant Editor Michael White, in discussing media self-censorship in March 2011, says: \"I have always sensed liberal, middle class ill-ease in going after stories about immigration, legal or otherwise, about welfare fraud or the less attractive tribal habits of the working class, which is more easily ignored altogether. Toffs, including royal ones, Christians, especially popes, governments of Israel, and US Republicans are more straightforward targets.\"In a 2013 interview for NPR, The Guardian\\'s Latin America correspondent Rory Carroll stated that many editors at The Guardian believed and continue to believe that they should support Hugo Chávez \"because he was a standard-bearer for the left\".In the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, The Guardian supported Yvette Cooper and was critical of left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, the successful candidate. These positions were criticised by the Morning Star, which accused The Guardian of being conservative. Although the majority of political columnists in The Guardian were against Corbyn winning, Owen Jones, Seumas Milne, and George Monbiot wrote supportive articles about him.\\nDespite this critical position, in the 2017 election The Guardian endorsed the Labour Party. In the 2019 European election The Guardian invited its readers to vote for pro-EU candidates, without endorsing specific parties.\\n\\nCirculation and format\\nThe Guardian had a certified average daily circulation of 204,222 copies in December 2012 — a drop of 11.25 per cent in January 2012 — as compared to sales of 547,465 for The Daily Telegraph, 396,041 for The Times, and 78,082 for The Independent. In March 2013, its average daily circulation had fallen to 193,586, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Circulation has continued to decline and stood at 161,091 in December 2016, a decline of 2.98 per cent year-on-year.\\n\\nPublication history\\nThe first edition was published on 5 May 1821, at which time The Guardian was a weekly, published on Saturdays and costing 7d; the stamp duty on newspapers (4d per sheet) forced the price up so high that it was uneconomic to publish more frequently. When the stamp duty was cut in 1836, The Guardian added a Wednesday edition and with the abolition of the tax in 1855 it became a daily paper costing 2d.\\nIn October 1952, the paper took the step of printing news on the front page, replacing the adverts that had hitherto filled that space. Then-editor A. P. Wadsworth wrote: \"It is not a thing I like myself, but it seems to be accepted by all the newspaper pundits that it is preferable to be in fashion.\"In 1959, the paper dropped \"Manchester\" from its title, becoming simply The Guardian, and in 1964 it moved to London, losing some of its regional agenda but continuing to be heavily subsidised by sales of the more downmarket but more profitable Manchester Evening News. The financial position remained extremely poor into the 1970s; at one time it was in merger talks with The Times. The paper consolidated its centre-left stance during the 1970s and 1980s.\\n\\nOn 12 February 1988, The Guardian had a significant redesign; as well as improving the quality of its printers\\' ink, it also changed its masthead to a juxtaposition of an italic Garamond \"The\", with a bold Helvetica \"Guardian\", that remained in use until the 2005 redesign.\\nIn 1992, The Guardian relaunched its features section as G2, a tabloid-format supplement. This innovation was widely copied by the other \"quality\" broadsheets and ultimately led to the rise of \"compact\" papers and The Guardian\\'s move to the Berliner format. In 1993 the paper declined to participate in the broadsheet price war started by Rupert Murdoch\\'s The Times. In June 1993, The Guardian bought The Observer from Lonrho, thus gaining a serious Sunday sister newspaper with similar political views.\\nIts international weekly edition is now titled The Guardian Weekly, though it retained the title Manchester Guardian Weekly for some years after the home edition had moved to London. It includes sections from a number of other internationally significant newspapers of a somewhat left-of-centre inclination, including Le Monde and The Washington Post. The Guardian Weekly was also linked to a website for expatriates, Guardian Abroad, which was launched in 2007 but had been taken offline by 2012.\\n\\nMoving to the Berliner paper format\\nThe Guardian is printed in full colour, and was the first newspaper in the UK to use the Berliner format for its main section, while producing sections and supplements in a range of page sizes including tabloid, approximately A4, and pocket-size (approximately A5).\\nIn 2004, The Guardian announced plans to change to a Berliner or \"midi\" format, similar to that used by Die Tageszeitung in Germany, Le Monde in France and many other European papers. At 470×315 mm, this is slightly larger than a traditional tabloid. Planned for the autumn of 2005, this change followed moves by The Independent and The Times to start publishing in tabloid (or compact) format. On Thursday, 1 September 2005, The Guardian announced that it would launch the new format on Monday 12 September 2005. Sister Sunday newspaper The Observer also changed to this new format on 8 January 2006.\\nThe format switch was accompanied by a comprehensive redesign of the paper\\'s look. On Friday, 9 September 2005, the newspaper unveiled its newly designed front page, which débuted on Monday 12 September 2005. Designed by Mark Porter, the new look includes a new masthead for the newspaper, its first since 1988. A typeface family designed by Paul Barnes and Christian Schwartz was created for the new design. With just over 200 fonts, it was described as \"one of the most ambitious custom type programs ever commissioned by a newspaper\". Among the fonts is Guardian Egyptian, a slab serif that is used in various weights for both text and headlines, and is central to the redesign.\\nThe switch cost Guardian Newspapers £80 million and involved setting up new printing presses in east London and Manchester. This switch was necessary because, before The Guardian\\'s move, no printing presses in Britain could produce newspapers in the Berliner format. There were additional complications, as one of the paper\\'s presses was part-owned by Telegraph Newspapers and Express Newspapers, contracted to use the plant until 2009. Another press was shared with the Guardian Media Group\\'s north-western tabloid local papers, which did not wish to switch to the Berliner format.\\n\\nReception\\nThe new format was generally well received by Guardian readers, who were encouraged to provide feedback on the changes. The only controversy was over the dropping of the Doonesbury cartoon strip. The paper reported thousands of calls and emails complaining about its loss; within 24 hours the decision was reversed and the strip was reinstated the following week. G2 supplement editor Ian Katz, who was responsible for dropping it, apologised in the editors\\' blog saying, \"I\\'m sorry, once again, that I made you—and the hundreds of fellow fans who have called our helpline or mailed our comments\\' address—so cross.\" However, some readers were dissatisfied as the earlier deadline needed for the all-colour sports section meant coverage of late-finishing evening football matches became less satisfactory in the editions supplied to some parts of the country.\\nThe investment was rewarded with a circulation rise. In December 2005, the average daily sale stood at 380,693, nearly 6 per cent higher than the figure for December 2004. (However, as of December 2012, circulation had dropped to 204,222.) In 2006, the US-based Society for News Design chose The Guardian and Polish daily Rzeczpospolita as the world\\'s best-designed newspapers—from among 389 entries from 44 countries.\\n\\nTabloid format since 2018\\nIn June 2017, Guardian Media Group (GMG) announced that The Guardian and The Observer would relaunch in tabloid format from early 2018. The Guardian confirmed the launch date for the new format to be 15 January 2018. GMG also signed a contract with Trinity Mirror – the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, and Sunday People – to outsource printing of The Guardian and The Observer.The format change is intended to help cut costs as it allows the paper to be printed by a wider array of presses, and outsourcing the printing to presses owned by Trinity Mirror is expected to save millions of pounds annually.  The move is part of a three-year plan that includes cutting 300 jobs in an attempt to reduce losses and break even by 2019. The paper and ink are the same as previously and the font size is fractionally larger.An assessment of the response from readers in late April 2018 indicated that the new format had led to an increased number of subscriptions. The editors were working on changing aspects that had caused complaints from readers.In July 2018, the masthead of the new tabloid format was adjusted to a dark blue.\\n\\nOnline media\\nThe Guardian and its Sunday sibling The Observer publish all their news online, with free access both to current news and an archive of three million stories. A third of the site\\'s hits are for items over a month old. As of May 2013, it was the most popular UK newspaper website with 8.2 million unique visitors per month, just ahead of Mail Online with 7.6 million unique monthly visitors. In April 2011, MediaWeek reported that The Guardian was the fifth most popular newspaper site in the world. Journalists use an analytics tool called Ophan, built entire in-house, to measure website data around stories and audience.The Guardian launched an iOS mobile application for its content in 2009. An Android app followed in 2011. In 2018, the newspaper announced its apps and mobile website would be redesigned to coincide with its relaunch as a tabloid.The Comment is Free section features columns by the paper\\'s journalists and regular commentators, as well as articles from guest writers, including readers\\' comments and responses below. The section includes all the opinion pieces published in the paper itself, as well as many others that only appear online. Censorship is exercised by Moderators who can ban posts – with no right of appeal – by those who they feel have overstepped the mark. The Guardian has taken what they call a very \"open\" stance in delivering news, and have launched an open platform for their content. This allows external developers to easily use Guardian content in external applications, and even to feed third-party content back into the Guardian network. The Guardian also had a number of talkboards that were noted for their mix of political discussion and whimsy until they were closed on Friday, 25 February 2011 after they had settled a libel action brought after months of harassment of a conservative party activist. They were spoofed in The Guardian\\'s own regular humorous Chatroom column in G2. The spoof column purported to be excerpts from a chatroom on permachat.co.uk, a real URL that pointed to The Guardian\\'s talkboards.\\nIn August 2013, a webshow titled Thinkfluencer was launched by Guardian Multimedia in association with Arte.\\nIn 2004 the paper also launched a dating website, Guardian Soulmates; this is to close at the end of June 2020.\\n\\nPodcasts\\nThe paper entered podcasting in 2005 with a twelve-part weekly podcast series by Ricky Gervais. In January 2006, Gervais\\' show topped the iTunes podcast chart having been downloaded by two million listeners worldwide, and was scheduled to be listed in the 2007 Guinness Book of Records as the most downloaded podcast.The Guardian now offers several regular podcasts made by its journalists. One of the most prominent is Today in Focus, a daily news podcast hosted by Anushka Asthana and launched on 1 November 2018. It was an immediate success and became one of the UK\\'s most-downloaded podcasts.\\n\\nGuardianFilms\\nIn 2003, The Guardian started the film production company GuardianFilms, headed by journalist Maggie O\\'Kane. Much of the company\\'s output is documentary made for television– and it has included Salam Pax\\'s Baghdad Blogger for BBC Two\\'s daily flagship Newsnight, some of which have been shown in compilations by CNN International, Sex on the Streets and Spiked, both made for the UK\\'s Channel 4 television.GuardianFilms has received several broadcasting awards. In addition to two Amnesty International Media Awards in 2004 and 2005, The Baghdad Blogger: Salam Pax won a Royal Television Society Award in 2005. Baghdad: A Doctor\\'s Story won an Emmy Award for Best International Current Affairs film in 2007. In 2008, photojournalist Sean Smith\\'s Inside the Surge won the Royal Television Society award for best international news film – the first time a newspaper has won such an award. The same year, The Guardian\\'s Katine website was awarded for its outstanding new media output at the One World Media awards. Again in 2008, GuardianFilms\\' undercover video report revealing vote rigging by Robert Mugabe\\'s Zanu PF party during the 2007 Zimbabwe election won best news programme of the year at the Broadcast Awards.\\n\\nReferences in popular culture\\nThe paper\\'s nickname The Grauniad (sometimes abbreviated as \"Graun\") originated with the satirical magazine Private Eye. This anagram played on The Guardian\\'s early reputation for frequent typographical errors, including misspelling its own name as The Gaurdian.The first issue of the newspaper contained a number of errors, including a notification that there would soon be some goods sold at atction instead of auction. Fewer typographical errors are seen in the paper since the end of hot-metal typesetting. One Guardian writer, Keith Devlin, suggested that the high number of observed misprints was due more to the quality of the readership than the misprints\\' greater frequency. The fact that the newspaper was printed in Manchester until 1961 and the early, more error-prone, prints were sent to London by train may have contributed to this image as well. When John Cole was appointed news editor by Alastair Hetherington in 1963, he sharpened the paper\\'s comparatively \"amateurish\" setup.\\n\\nAwards\\nReceived\\nThe Guardian has been awarded the National Newspaper of the Year in 1998, 2005, 2010 and 2013 by the British Press Awards, and Front Page of the Year in 2002 (\"A declaration of war\", 12 September 2001).

The centre preserved and promoted the histories and values of the newspapers through its archive, educational programmes and exhibitions. The Newsroom\\'s activities were all transferred to Kings Place in 2008. Now known as the Guardian News & Media archive, the archive preserves and promotes the histories and values of The Guardian and The Observer newspapers by collecting and making accessible material that provides an accurate and comprehensive history of the papers. The archive holds official records of The Guardian and The Observer, and also seeks to acquire material from individuals who have been associated with the papers. As well as corporate records, the archive holds correspondence, diaries, notebooks, original cartoons and photographs belonging to staff of the papers. This material may be consulted by members of the public by prior appointment. An extensive Manchester Guardian archive also exists at the University of Manchester\\'s John Rylands University Library, and there is a collaboration programme between the two archives. Additionally, the British Library has a large archive of The Manchester Guardian available in its British Library Newspapers collection, in online, hard copy, microform, and CD-ROM formats.\\nIn November 2007, The Guardian and The Observer made their archives available over the internet via DigitalArchive. The current extent of the archives available are 1821 to 2000 for The Guardian and 1791 to 2000 for The Observer: these archives will eventually run up to 2003.\\nThe Newsroom\\'s other components were also transferred to Kings Place in 2008. The Guardian\\'s Education Centre provides a range of educational programmes for students and adults. The Guardian\\'s exhibition space was also moved to Kings Place, and has a rolling programme of exhibitions that investigate and reflect upon aspects of news and newspapers and the role of journalism. This programme often draws on the archive collections held in the GNM Archive.\\n\\nSee also\\nJournalism portal\\n United Kingdom portal\\nGuardian Monthly\\nThe Guardian Weekly\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nAyerst, David (1971).

              " 'The Hollywood Reporter': 'The Hollywood Reporter (THR) is an American digital and print magazine, and website, which focuses on the Hollywood film, television, and entertainment industries. It was founded in 1930 as a daily trade paper, and in 2010 switched to a weekly large-format print magazine with a revamped website. Headquartered in Los Angeles, THR is owned by Penske Media Corporation.\\n\\nHistory\\nEarly years; 1930-1987\\nThe Hollywood Reporter was founded in 1930 by William R. \"Billy\" Wilkerson (1890–1962) as Hollywood\\'s first daily entertainment trade newspaper. The first edition appeared on September 3, 1930, and featured Wilkerson\\'s front-page \"Tradeviews\" column, which became influential. The newspaper appeared Monday-to-Saturday for the first 10 years, except for a brief period, then Monday-to-Friday from 1940. Wilkerson used caustic articles and gossip to generate publicity and got noticed by the studio bosses in New York and some studio lots tried to ban the paper.Wilkerson became friends with Howard Hughes and the paper wrote many favorable stories about him and his film plans. In return, Hughes, in addition to advertising revenue, also provided financial assistance to the paper when necessary.Wilkerson ran The Hollywood Reporter until his death in September 1962, although his final column appeared 18 months prior. Wilkerson\\'s wife, Tichi Wilkerson Kassel, took over as publisher and editor-in-chief when her husband died.\\n\\nHollywood blacklist\\nFrom the late 1930s, Wilkerson used The Hollywood Reporter to push the view that the industry was a communist stronghold. In particular, he opposed the screenplay writers\\' trade union, the Screen Writers Guild, which he called the \"Red Beachhead.\" In 1946 the Guild considered creating an American Authors\\' Authority to hold copyright for writers, instead of ownership passing to the studios. Wilkerson devoted his \"Tradeviews\" column to the issue on July 29, 1946, headlined \"A Vote for Joe Stalin.\" He went to confession before publishing it, knowing the damage it would cause, but was apparently encouraged by the priest to go ahead with it.The column contained the first industry names, including Dalton Trumbo and Howard Koch, on what became the Hollywood blacklist, known as \"Billy\\'s list.\" Eight of the 11 people Wilkerson named were among the \"Hollywood Ten\" who were blacklisted after hearings in 1947 by the House Un-American Activities Committee. When Wilkerson died, his THR obituary said that he had \"named names, pseudonyms and card numbers and was widely credited with being chiefly responsible for preventing communists from becoming entrenched in Hollywood production.\"In 1997 THR reporter David Robb wrote a story about the newspaper\\'s involvement, but the editor, Robert J. Dowling, declined to run it. For the blacklist\\'s 65th anniversary in 2012, the THR published a lengthy investigative piece about Wilkerson\\'s role, by reporters Gary Baum and Daniel Miller. The same edition carried an apology from Wilkerson\\'s son W. R. Wilkerson III. He wrote that his father had been motivated by revenge for his thwarted ambition to own a studio.\\n\\n1988–2008\\nOn April 11, 1988, Tichi Wilkerson Kassel sold the paper to BPI Communications, owned by Affiliated Publications, for $26.7 million. Robert J. Dowling became THR president in 1988, and editor-in-chief and publisher in 1991. Dowling hired Alex Ben Block as editor in 1990. Block and Teri Ritzer damped much of the sensationalism and cronyism that was prominent in the paper under the Wilkersons. In 1994, BPI Communications was sold to Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen (VNU) for $220 million.In March 2006 a private equity consortium led by Blackstone and KKR, both with ties to the conservative movement in the United States, acquired THR along with the other assets of VNU. It joined those publications with AdWeek and A.C. Nielsen to form The Nielsen Company.Matthew King, vice president for content and audience, editorial director Howard Burns, and executive editor Peter Pryor left the paper in a wave of layoffs in December 2006; editor Cynthia Littleton, widely respected throughout the industry, reported directly to Kilcullen. The Reporter absorbed another blow when Littleton left her position for an editorial job at Variety in March 2007. Web editor Glenn Abel also left after 16 years with the paper.\\n\\n2009–present\\nIn December 2009, Prometheus Global Media, a newly formed company formed by Pluribus Capital Management and Guggenheim Partners, and chaired by Jimmy Finkelstein, CEO of News Communications, parent of political journal The Hill, acquired THR from Nielsen Business Media. It pledged to invest in the brand and grow the company. Richard Beckman, formerly of Condé Nast, was appointed as CEO.\\nIn 2010, Beckman recruited Janice Min, the former editor-in-chief of Us Weekly, as Editorial Director to \"eviscerate\" the existing daily trade paper and reinvent it as a glossy, large-format weekly magazine. The Hollywood Reporter relaunched with a weekly print edition and a revamped website that enabled it to break news. Eight months after its initial report, The New York Times took note of the many scoops THR had generated, adding that the new glossy format seemed to be succeeding with its \"rarefied demographic\", stating, \"They managed to change the subject by going weekly... The large photos, lush paper stock and great design are a kind of narcotic here.\"By February 2013\\' the Times returned to THR, filing a report on a party for Academy Award nominees the magazine had hosted at the Los Angeles restaurant Spago. Noting the crowd of top celebrities in attendance, the Times alluded to the fact that many Hollywood insiders were now referring to THR as \"the new Vanity Fair\". Ad sales since Min\\'s hiring were up more than 50%, while traffic to the magazine\\'s website had grown by 800%.In January 2014, Janice Min was promoted to President/Chief Creative Officer of the Entertainment Group of Guggenheim Media, giving her oversight of THR and its sister brand Billboard. Min is joined by co-preseident John Amato, who is responsible for business initiatives.Guggenheim Partners announced on December 17, 2015, that it would sell the Prometheus media properties to its executive Todd Boehly. The company was sold to Eldridge Industries in February 2017. On February 1, 2018, Eldridge Industries announced the merger of its media properties with Media Rights Capital to form Valence Media.In February 2017 Min announced she was stepping down from her role as President/Chief Creative Officer overseeing The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard to take on a new role at parent company. Simultaneously, it was announced that longtime executive editor Matthew Belloni would take over as Editorial Director.In April 2020, Belloni announced he was abruptly stepping down after 14 years at the publication in the wake of recent clashes with the company’s leadership over editorial issues. Allegedly, Asif Satchu and Modi Wiczyk, co-CEOs of parent company Valence Media, have pushed the editorial staffs at its publications to not run stories, to spike unfavorable stories about friends, and to overpromote Valence-owned businesses like Dick Clark Productions.On September 23, 2020, it was announced that Penske Media Corporation, the current owner of Variety, would assume operations of the MRC Media & Info publications under a joint venture with MRC known as PMRC.\\n\\nPublishers\\nFounder Billy Wilkerson served as the publisher of THR until his death in September 1962. Wilkerson\\'s wife, Tichi Wilkerson Kassel, took over as publisher and editor-in-chief when her husband died.\\nRobert J. Dowling, who was named president of THR when Kassel sold the company, became editor-in-chief and publisher in 1991.Tony Uphoff assumed the publisher position in November 2005.John Kilcullen replaced Uphoff in October 2006, as publisher of Billboard. Kilcullen was a defendant in Billboard\\'s infamous \"dildo\" lawsuit, in which he was accused of race discrimination and sexual harassment. VNU settled the suit on the courthouse steps. Kilcullen \"exited\" Nielsen in February 2008 \"to pursue his passion as an entrepreneur.\"In April 2010 Lori Burgess was named as publisher. Burgess had been publisher of OK! magazine since October 2008. Michaela Apruzzese was named associate publisher, entertainment in May 2010. Apruzzese previously served as the director of movie advertising for Los Angeles Times Media Group.\\nLynne Segall, former vice president and associate publisher, was named publisher and senior vice president in June 2011.\\n\\nEditions\\nPrint\\nThe weekly print edition of The Hollywood Reporter includes profiles, original photography and interviews with entertainment figures; articles about major upcoming releases and product launches; film reviews and film festival previews; coverage of the latest industry deals, TV ratings, box-office figures and analysis of global entertainment business trends and indicators; photos essays and reports from premieres and other red-carpet events; and the latest on Hollywood fashion and lifestyle.\\n\\nWebsite\\nThe Reporter published a primitive \"satellite\" digital edition in the late 1980s. It became the first daily entertainment trade paper to start a website in 1995. Initially, the site offered free news briefs with complete coverage firewalled as a premium paid service. In later years, the website became mostly free as it became more reliant on ad sales and less on subscribers. The website had already gone through a redesign by the time competitor Variety took to the web in 1998. In 2002 the Reporter\\'s website won the Jesse H. Neal Award for business journalism. In November 2013, The Hollywood Reporter launched the style site Pret-a-Reporter.THR.com, The Hollywood Reporter\\'s website, re-launched in 2010, offers breaking entertainment news, reviews and blogs; original video content (and film and TV clips) and photo galleries; plus in-depth movie, television, music, awards, style, technology and business coverage. As of August 2013, Comscore measured 12 million unique visitors per month to the site.\\n\\nEditors and reporters\\nTHR\\'s editors have included Janice Min (2010–2017), Elizabeth Guider (2007–2010), Cynthia Littleton (2005–2007), Howard Burns (2001–2006), Anita Busch (1999–2001), and Alex Ben Block (1990–1999).\\nAlex Ben Block was hired as editor for special issues in 1990, and was promoted to editor of the daily edition in 1992. After Block left, former Variety film editor, Anita Busch, became editor between 1999 and 2001. Busch was credited with making the paper competitive with Variety.\\nIn March 2006, Cynthia Littleton, former broadcast television editor and deputy editor, was named editor, but left the role a year later for an editorial job at Variety. In July 2007 THR named Elizabeth Guider as its new editor. An 18-year veteran of Variety, where she served as Executive Editor, Guider assumed responsibility for the editorial vision and strategic direction of The Hollywood Reporter\\'s daily and weekly editions, digital content offerings and executive conferences. Guider left The Hollywood Reporter in early 2010.In addition to hiring Eric Mika, Rose Eintstein and Elizabeth Guider, the Reporter hired the following staff in 2007:\\n\\nTodd Cunningham, former assistant managing editor of the LA Business Journal, as National Editor for The Hollywood Reporter: Premier Edition\\nSteven Zeitchik as Senior Writer, based in New York, where he provide news analysis and features for the Premiere Edition\\nMelissa Grego, former managing editor of TV Week, as Editor of HollywoodReporter.com\\nJonathan Landreth as the new Asian bureau chief, in addition to 13 new writers across AsiaHowever, staffing levels began to drop again in 2008. In April, Nielsen Business Media eliminated between 40 and 50 editorial staff positions at The Hollywood Reporter and its sister publications: Adweek, Brandweek, Editor & Publisher and Mediaweek. In December, another 12 editorial positions were cut at the trade paper. In addition, 2008 saw substantial turnover in the online department: THR.com Editor Melissa Grego left her position in July to become executive editor of Broadcasting & Cable, and Managing Editor Scott McKim left to become a new media manager at Knox College. With the entertainment industry as a whole shrinking, \"Hollywood studios have cut more than $20 million from the Motion Picture Association of America budget this year. The resulting staff and program reductions are expected to permanently shrink the scope and size of the six-studio trade and advocacy group.\"Staffing at THR in 2008 saw even further cutbacks with \"names from today\\'s tragic bloodletting of The Hollywood Reporter\\'s staff\" adding up quickly in the hard economic times at the end of 2008. \"The trade has not only been thin, but only publishing digital version 19 days this holiday season. Film writers Leslie Simmons, Carolyn Giardina, Gregg Goldstein, plus lead TV critic Barry Garron and TV reporter Kimberly Nordyke, also special issues editor Randee Dawn Cohen out of New York and managing editor Harley Lond and international department editor Hy Hollinger, plus Dan Evans, Lesley Goldberg, Michelle Belaski, James Gonzalez were among those chopped from the masthead.\"Gossip blogger Roger Friedman joined The Hollywood Reporter as a senior correspondent in May 2009, a year after being fired by Fox News for writing an article on an online illegally bootlegged preliminary copy of the movie.  Business Insider described it as a surprising and risky move. In March 2010, Friedman\\'s employment agreement was not renewed by The Hollywood Reporter.When Janice Min and Lori Burgess came on board in 2010, the editorial and sales staff increased nearly 50%, respectively. Min hired various recognized journalists in the entertainment industry, most notably Variety film critic Todd McCarthy after his firing from Variety in March 2010, as well as Kim Masters of NPR, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle, Lacey Rose of Forbes, and Pamela McClintock of Variety.\\n\\nCompetition and lawsuits\\nVariety was established in 1905 in New York City as a weekly trade paper, initially covering vaudeville, Tin Pan Alley and the city\\'s Theater District. In 1932, Variety sued The Hollywood Reporter for $46,500 for plagiarism, alleging that THR was plagiarizing information from Variety following its publication in New York on Tuesdays, by way of phoning or wiring the information back to Hollywood, so that THR could publish the information before Variety reached Hollywood three days later on Friday. Then, in 1933, Variety started its own daily Hollywood edition, Daily Variety, to cover the film industry.From 1988 to 2014, Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter were both located on Wilshire Boulevard along Miracle Mile. In March 2007, The Hollywood Reporter surpassed Daily Variety to achieve the largest total distribution of any entertainment daily.In 2011, Deadline Hollywood, a property of Penske Media Corporation, sued The Hollywood Reporter for more than $5 million, alleging copyright infringement. In 2013 THR\\'s parent company settled the suit. According to The Wall Street Journal, \"The lawsuit [was] widely viewed in Hollywood as a proxy for the bitter war for readers and advertising dollars... The two sides agreed on a statement reading in part: \\'Prometheus admits that The Hollywood Reporter copied source code from Penske Media Corporation\\'s Web site www.tvline.com; Prometheus and The Hollywood Reporter have apologized to Penske Media.\\'\"The Hollywood Reporter maintained a business association with the home entertainment trade publication Home Media Magazine, owned by Questex Media Group. It gave THR access into the home entertainment trade, which Variety similarly enjoyed with its former sister publication, the Reed-owned Video Business.\\n\\nCurrent status and legacy\\nThe Hollywood Reporter published out of the same offices on Sunset Boulevard for more than a half century.

              " 'The Last Samurai': 'The Last Samurai is a 2003 American period action drama film directed and co-produced by Edward Zwick, who also co-wrote the screenplay with John Logan and Marshall Herskovitz. The film stars Tom Cruise, who also co-produced, with Timothy Spall, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada, Koyuki, and Shin Koyamada in supporting roles.\\nTom Cruise portrays a United States Captain of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, whose personal and emotional conflicts bring him into contact with samurai warriors in the wake of the Meiji Restoration in 19th century Japan. The film\\'s plot was inspired by the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion led by Saigō Takamori, and the westernization of Japan by foreign powers, though in the film the United States is portrayed as the primary force behind the push for westernization. It is also influenced by the stories of Jules Brunet, a French army captain who fought alongside Enomoto Takeaki in the earlier Boshin War and to a lesser extent by Frederick Townsend Ward, an American mercenary who helped Westernize the Chinese army by forming the Ever Victorious Army.\\nThe Last Samurai grossed a total of $456 million at the box office and was well-received upon its release, receiving praise for the acting, writing, directing, score, visuals, costumes, but criticized in Japan for a romanticized \"storybook\" portrayal of the samurai, who are regarded as more corrupt. It was nominated for several awards, including four Academy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and two National Board of Review Awards.\\n\\nPlot\\nFormer Army Captain Nathan Algren, a bitter alcoholic traumatized by the atrocities he committed during the American Indian Wars, is approached by his former commanding officer, Colonel Bagley, to train the newly created Imperial Japanese Army for Omura, a wealthy Japanese businessman and political figure who intends to use the army to suppress a rebellion of discontented samurai against Japan\\'s new emperor. Despite his hatred of Bagley, an impoverished Algren takes the job for the money, and is accompanied to Japan by his old friend, Sergeant Zebulon Gant. Upon arriving, Algren meets Simon Graham, a British translator and photographer with extensive knowledge of the samurai.\\nAlgren finds the Imperial soldiers are actually conscripted peasants that have no battlefield experience or proper training. Before he can train his men, Algren is informed that the samurai are attacking one of Omura\\'s railroads; Omura sends the army after them, despite Algren\\'s protests that they are not ready. The battle is a disaster, with the undisciplined conscripts fleeing in terror and Gant getting killed. Algren fights to the last before he is surrounded; expecting to die, he is taken prisoner when the enemy commander, Katsumoto, decides to spare him. Algren is taken to Katsumoto\\'s village to live with his family. While he is treated poorly at first, he eventually befriends Katsumoto and earns the respect of his samurai. Algren overcomes his alcoholism and guilt, learns Japanese, and becomes proficient in the samurai style of fighting. He develops sympathy for Katsumoto\\'s cause, recognizing that they are genuinely upset with how Western technology and customs have eroded the traditions of their society and their influence and power. Algren and Taka, Katsumoto\\'s sister and the widow of a samurai killed by Algren, develop an unspoken affection for each other.\\nOne night, a group of assassins infiltrate the village and attempt to kill Katsumoto. Algren saves Katsumoto\\'s life, and then helps defend the village. Katsumoto requests a meeting with Emperor Meiji and is given safe passage to Tokyo. He brings Algren, intending to release him. Upon arriving in Tokyo, Algren finds the Imperial Army is now a well-trained and fully equipped fighting force under Bagley. Katsumoto, to his dismay, discovers that the young and inexperienced Emperor has essentially become a puppet of Omura. At a government meeting, Omura orders Katsumoto\\'s arrest for carrying a sword in public and asks him to perform seppuku to redeem his honor. Algren refuses Omura\\'s offer to betray Katsumoto and kills several armed men who try to ambush him. Algren and Graham assist the samurai in freeing Katsumoto; in the process, Katsumoto\\'s son Nobutada is mortally wounded and sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape.\\nAs the Imperial Army marches to crush the rebellion, a grieving Katsumoto contemplates suicide, but Algren convinces him to fight until the end, and joins the samurai in battle. The samurai use the Imperial Army\\'s overconfidence to lure them into a trap, cutting them off from their artillery and showering them with arrows. The ensuing battle inflicts massive casualties on both sides and forces the Imperial soldiers to retreat. Knowing that Imperial reinforcements are coming and defeat is inevitable, Katsumoto orders his remaining men to join him in a suicidal cavalry charge. During the charge, the samurai break through Bagley\\'s line. Bagley is killed by Algren, but the samurai are quickly mowed down by gatling guns. The Imperial captain, previously trained by Algren and horrified by the sight of the dying samurai, orders all of the guns to cease firing, disregarding Omura\\'s orders. A mortally wounded Katsumoto commits seppuku with Algren\\'s help as the soldiers at the scene kneel in respect.\\nDays later, as trade negotiations conclude, an injured Algren arrives in his old Army uniform and interrupts the proceedings. He presents the Emperor with Katsumoto\\'s sword and asks him to remember the traditions for which Katsumoto and his fellow samurai died. The Emperor realizes that while Japan should modernize, it cannot forget its own culture and history; he promptly refuses to sign the trade treaty. When Omura protests, the Emperor silences him by threatening to seize his family\\'s assets and distribute them among the populace.\\nAlgren subsequently disappears. While various rumors regarding his fate circulate, Graham concludes that Algren has finally found peace as he is seen returning to the village and reuniting with Taka.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War and Indian War veteran haunted by his role in the massacre of Native Americans at the Washita River. Following a dismissal from his job, he agrees to help the new Meiji Restoration government train its first Western-style conscript army for a significant sum of money. During the army\\'s first battle he is captured by the samurai Katsumoto and taken to the village of Katsumoto\\'s son, where he soon becomes intrigued with the way of the samurai and decides to join them in their cause. His journal entries reveal his impressions about traditional Japanese culture, which almost immediately evolve into unrestrained admiration.\\nKen Watanabe as Lord Moritsgu Katsumoto, a former daimyo who was once Emperor Meiji\\'s most trusted teacher. His displeasure with the influence of Omura and other Western reformers on the Emperor lead him to organize his fellow samurai in a revolt, which he hopes will convince the government not to destroy the samurai\\'s place in Japanese society. Katsumoto is based on real-life samurai Saigō Takamori, who led the Satsuma Rebellion.\\nKoyuki Kato as Taka, wife of a samurai slain by Nathan Algren and younger sister of Lord Katsumoto. She and Algren develop feelings for each other, and she gives him her husband\\'s armor to wear in the final battle of the rebellion.\\nShin Koyamada as Nobutada Katsumoto, Katsumoto\\'s son who is responsible for the village where Algren is sent. Nobutada befriends Algren when Katsumoto assigns him to teach Algren Japanese culture and the Japanese language. He dies when he willingly chooses to distract Imperial troops so his father can escape their custody.\\nTony Goldwyn as Colonel Bagley, Nathan Algren\\'s former commanding officer in the 7th Cavalry Regiment, who hires him to serve as a training instructor for the Imperial Army despite Algren\\'s hatred of Bagley for his role in the Washita River massacre. In contrast to Algren, Bagley is arrogant and dismissive of the samurai, at one point referring to them nothing more than \"savages with bows and arrows\". He is killed by Algren who throws a sword into his chest when Bagley tries to shoot Katsumoto in the final battle.\\nMasato Harada as Matsue Omura, an industrialist and pro-reform politician. He quickly imports westernization and modernization while making money for himself through his ownership of Japan\\'s railroads. Coming from a merchant family, a social class repressed during the days of Shogun rule, Omura openly expresses his contempt for the samurai and takes advantage of Emperor Meiji\\'s youth to become his chief advisor, persuading him to form a Western-style army for the sole purpose of wiping out Katsumoto and his rebels while ignoring their grievances. His appearance is designed to evoke the image of Okubo Toshimichi, a leading reformer during the Meiji Restoration. Harada noted that he was deeply interested in joining the film after witnessing the construction of Emperor Meiji\\'s conference room on sound stage 19 (where Humphrey Bogart had once acted) at Warner Brothers studios.\\nShichinosuke Nakamura as Emperor Meiji. Credited with the implementation of the Meiji reforms to Japanese society, the Emperor is eager to import Western ideas and practices to modernize and empower Japan to become a strong nation. However, his inexperience causes him to rely heavily on the advice of men like Omura, who have their own agendas. His appearance bears a strong resemblance to Emperor Meiji during the 1860s (when his authority as Emperor was not yet firmly established) rather than during the 1870s, when the film takes place.\\nHiroyuki Sanada as Ujio, a master swordsman and one of Katsumoto\\'s most trusted followers. He teaches Algren the art of sword fighting, coming to respect him as an equal. He is one of the last samurai to die in the final battle, being gunned down during Katsumoto\\'s charge.\\nTimothy Spall as Simon Graham, a British photographer and scholar hired as an interpreter for Captain Algren and his non-English speaking soldiers. Initially portrayed as a friendly yet mission-oriented and practical-minded companion, he later comes to sympathize with the samurai cause and helps Algren rescue Katsumoto from Imperial soldiers.\\nSeizo Fukumoto as Silent Samurai, an elderly samurai tasked with monitoring Algren during his time in the village, who calls the samurai \"Bob\". \"Bob\" ultimately saves Algren\\'s life (and speaking for the first and only time, \"Algren-san!\") by taking a bullet meant for him in the final battle.\\nBilly Connolly as Sergeant Zebulon Gant, an Irish-American Civil War veteran who served with and is loyal to Algren, persuading him to come to Japan and working with him to train the Imperial Army. During the first battle, he is killed by Hirotaro (Taka\\'s husband) after another samurai wounds him with a spear.\\nShun Sugata as Nakao, a tall samurai who wields a naginata and is skilled in jujutsu. He assists Algren in rescuing Katsumoto, and dies along with the other samurai in the final battle.\\n\\nProduction\\nFilming took place in New Zealand, mostly in the Taranaki region, with Japanese cast members and an American production crew. This location was chosen due to the fact that Egmont/Mount Taranaki resembles Mount Fuji, and also because there is a lot of forest and farmland in the Taranaki region. American Location Manager Charlie Harrington saw the mountain in a travel book and encouraged the producers to send him to Taranaki to scout the locations. This acted as a backdrop for many scenes, as opposed to the built up cities of Japan. Several of the village scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. Studios backlot in Burbank, California. Some scenes were shot in Kyoto and Himeji, Japan. There were 13 filming locations altogether. Tom Cruise did his own stunts for the film.\\nThe film is based on an original screenplay entitled \"The Last Samurai\", from a story by John Logan. The project itself was inspired by writer and director Vincent Ward. Ward became executive producer on the film – working in development on it for nearly four years and after approaching several directors (Francis Ford Coppola, Peter Weir), until he became interested with Edward Zwick. The film production went ahead with Zwick and was shot in Ward\\'s native New Zealand.\\nThe film was based on the stories of Jules Brunet, a French army captain who fought alongside Enomoto Takeaki in the earlier Boshin War and Frederick Townsend Ward, an American mercenary who helped westernize the Qing army by forming the Ever Victorious Army. The historical roles of other European nations who were involved in the westernization of Japan are largely attributed to the United States in the film, although the film references European involvement as well.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe Last Samurai: Original Motion Picture Score was released on November 25, 2003 by Warner Sunset Records. All music on the soundtrack was composed, arranged, and produced by Hans Zimmer, performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony, and conducted by Blake Neely. It peaked at number 24 on the US Top Soundtracks chart.\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nThe film achieved higher box office receipts in Japan than in the United States. Critical reception in Japan was generally positive. Tomomi Katsuta of The Mainichi Shinbun thought that the film was \"a vast improvement over previous American attempts to portray Japan\", noting that director Edward Zwick \"had researched Japanese history, cast well-known Japanese actors and consulted dialogue coaches to make sure he didn\\'t confuse the casual and formal categories of Japanese speech.\" Katsuta still found fault with the film\\'s idealistic, \"storybook\" portrayal of the samurai, stating: \"Our image of samurai is that they were more corrupt.\" As such, he said, the noble samurai leader Katsumoto \"set my teeth on edge.\"In the United States, critic Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"beautifully designed, intelligently written, acted with conviction, it\\'s an uncommonly thoughtful epic.\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 66% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 221 reviews, with an average score of 6.43/10. The site\\'s consensus states: \"With high production values and thrilling battle scenes, The Last Samurai is a satisfying epic\". At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 55, based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".One on-line analyst compares the movie favorably to Dances With Wolves in that each protagonist meets and combats a \"technologically backward people\".  Both Costner\\'s and Cruise\\'s characters have suffered through a series of traumatic and brutal battles.  Each ultimately uses his experiences to later assist his new friends.  Each comes to respect his newly adopted culture.  Each even fights with his new community against the people and traditions from which he came.  []\\n\\nBox office\\nAs of January 1, 2016, the film had grossed $456.8 million against a production budget of $140 million. It grossed $111,127,263 in the United States and Canada, and $345,631,718 in other territories. It was one of the most successful box office hits in Japan, where it grossed ¥13.7 billion ($132 million).\\n\\nAccolades\\nCriticism and debate\\nMotoko Rich of The New York Times observed that the film has opened up a debate, \"particularly among Asian-Americans and Japanese,\" about whether the film and others like it were \"racist, naïve, well-intentioned, accurate – or all of the above.\"Todd McCarthy, a film critic for the Variety magazine, wrote: \"Clearly enamored of the culture it examines while resolutely remaining an outsider\\'s romanticization of it, yarn is disappointingly content to recycle familiar attitudes about the nobility of ancient cultures, Western despoilment of them, liberal historical guilt, the unrestrainable greed of capitalists and the irreducible primacy of Hollywood movie stars.\"According to history professor Cathy Schultz, \"Many samurai fought Meiji modernization not for altruistic reasons but because it challenged their status as the privileged warrior caste. Meiji reformers proposed the radical idea that all men essentially being equal ... The film also misses the historical reality that many Meiji policy advisors were former samurai, who had voluntarily given up their traditional privileges to follow a course they believed would strengthen Japan.\"The fictional character of Katsumoto bears a striking resemblance to the historical figure of Saigō Takamori, a hero of the Meiji Restoration and the leader of the ineffective Satsuma Rebellion, who appears in the histories and legends of modern Japan as a hero against the corruption, extravagance, and unprincipled politics of his contemporaries. \"Though he had agreed to become a member of the new government,\" writes the translator and historian Ivan Morris, \"it was clear from his writings and statements that he believed the ideals of the civil war were being vitiated. He was opposed to the excessively rapid changes in Japanese society and was particularly disturbed by the shabby treatment of the warrior class.\" Suspicious of the new bureaucracy, he wanted power to remain in the hands of the samurai class and the Emperor, and it was for this purpose that he had joined the central government. \"Edicts like the interdiction against carrying swords and wearing the traditional topknot seemed like a series of gratuitous provocations; and, though Saigō realized that Japan needed an effective standing army to resist pressure from the West, he could not countenance the social implications of the military reforms. For this reason Saigō, although participating in the Okinoerabu government, continued to exercise a powerful appeal among disgruntled ex-samurai in Satsuma and elsewhere.\" Saigō fought for a moral revolution, not a material one, and he described his revolt as a check on the declining morality of a new, Westernizing materialism.In 2014, the movie was one of several discussed by Keli Goff in The Daily Beast in an article concerning white savior narratives in film, a cinematic trope studied in sociology, for which The Last Samurai has been analyzed. David Sirota at Salon saw the film as \"yet another film presenting the white Union army official as personally embodying the North\\'s Civil War effort to liberate people of color\" and criticizing the release poster as \"a not-so-subtle message encouraging audiences to (wrongly) perceive the white guy -- and not a Japanese person -- as the last great leader of the ancient Japanese culture.\"\\n\\nSee also\\nForeign government advisors in Meiji Japan\\nŌmura Masujirō\\nFrench Military Mission to Japan (1867)\\nMark Rappaport (creature effects artist)\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nPrimadhy Wicaksono (2007). \"THE INFLUENCE OF BUSHIDO ON NATHAN ALGREN\\'S PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AS SEEN IN JOHN LOGAN\\'S  MOVIE SCRIPT THE LAST SAMURAI\" (PDF).

A reboot of The Mummy franchise, the film stars Tom Cruise as U.S. Army Sergeant Nick Morton, a soldier of fortune who accidentally unearths the ancient tomb of entrapped Egyptian princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella). Annabelle Wallis, Jake Johnson, Courtney B. Vance, and Russell Crowe also star.\\nThe Mummy premiered at the State Theatre in Sydney, Australia, on May 22, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 9, 2017, in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and despite grossing $410 million worldwide, it was estimated to have lost the studio as much as $95 million. Initially intended to kickstart Dark Universe, an attempt to create a modern cinematic universe based on the classic Universal Monsters film series, the film\\'s poor box office performance led to the discontinuation and cancelation of the Dark Universe.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn present-day London, construction workers discover the tomb of a crusader knight who was buried with an Egyptian ruby in 1127 AD. In Iraq, U.S. Army soldiers Sergeant Nick Morton and Corporal Chris Vail discover the tomb of Princess Ahmanet, who attempted to summon the deity Set; she was caught and mummified alive. They and archaeologist Jenny Halsey fly Ahmanet\\'s sarcophagus to Britain.\\nDuring the flight, Chris is possessed by Ahmanet through a spider that bit him in the tomb and attacks the others, and is killed by Nick. Many crows attack the plane, causing it to crash, killing the crew except Jenny, who escapes by a parachute Nick gives her.\\nNick returns to life in a morgue. Chris\\'s ghost appears and tells him he has been cursed by Ahmanet, who seeks to use him as a vessel for Set. Ahmanet\\'s mummy escapes from the sarcophagus and begins feeding on people to regenerate her body; she recovers the Dagger of Set and turns workers into zombies. They trap Nick and Jenny.\\nSoldiers appear and subdue Ahmanet. Their leader, Dr. Henry Jekyll, explains that Jenny is an agent of Prodigium, a secret society dedicated to hunting supernatural threats. Nick and Jenny discover that Dr. Jekyll intends to allow Set to possess Nick completely, believing that this will render Set vulnerable.\\nJekyll transforms into Edward Hyde. Nick stops him with a serum that Jekyll invented for this purpose, and he and Jenny escape. Ahmanet finds them, regains the dagger, summons many crusader zombies, and creates a large sandstorm in London. Nick and Jenny escape again. The crusader zombies kill the Prodigium soldiers and Ahmanet recovers the ruby, combining it with the dagger in order to free Set.\\nGuided by Chris\\'s ghost, Nick and Jenny flee into the London Underground, where they are attacked by Ahmanet\\'s minions. Ahmanet captures Jenny and drowns her. Nick is injured when he tries to attack Ahmanet, and he lets Ahmanet embrace him as a ruse to steal the dagger and shatter the ruby. He strikes the pommel of the dagger against the floor, cracking the ruby. As he is about to shatter the ruby, Ahmanet reminds him that the dagger could grant him the power to reverse death. Instead of destroying the gem, he stabs himself; because the ruby is cracked, he is only partially possessed by Set. Nick goes to Ahmanet, but, remembering the words of Jenny and Dr. Jekyll, he turns on her and uses Set\\'s powers to extract Ahmanet\\'s lifeforce and resurrect Jenny. Knowing the Prodigium are coming for him, he says goodbye to Jenny and vanishes.\\nAs Ahmanet is sealed back in her tomb, Jenny and Dr. Jekyll wonder whether Nick, now fused with Set, will use his powers for good.

The project went through multiple directors, with Len Wiseman leaving the project in 2013, and a second director, Andrés Muschietti, in 2014.Tom Cruise began talks about playing the lead in November 2015, with Sofia Boutella beginning talks that December. Gwen Stefani, Jamie Chung, Lindsey Stirling and Brooke Shields were also considered.  Kurtzman cast Boutella after seeing and being impressed by her largely mute performance in Kingsman: The Secret Service. Kurtzman noted that \"if you look at her eyes, and this is what I got from watching Kingsman, there\\'s a whole performance going on here. And in not saying anything but conveying that much to me, I thought oh my god, no matter how much prosthetics we put on her, no matter how much CG we put on her face, if I see this, she\\'s going to convey something very emotional to me.\" Other casting news was announced between March and May, with Russell Crowe joining during the latter month.Shortly after the film opened, Variety reported that Cruise had excessive control over the film and firm control of nearly every aspect of production and post-production, including re-writing the script and editing to his specifications, telling Kurtzman how to direct on set, and enlarging his role while downplaying Boutella\\'s. Universal contractually guaranteed Cruise control of most aspects of the project, from script approval to post-production decisions. In a statement, Universal denied that Cruise had a negative influence on the production, “Tom approaches every project with a level of commitment and dedication that is unmatched by most working in our business today,” the statement read. “He has been a true partner and creative collaborator, and his goal with any project he works on is to provide audiences with a truly cinematic moviegoing experience.” Kurtzman said about the movie in a 2019 interview that, \"The Mummy wasn’t what I wanted it to be. I’m no longer involved in that and have no idea what’s going on with it. I look back on it now [and] what felt painful at the time ended up being an incredible blessing for me.\"\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography on the film began on April 3, 2016, in Oxford, United Kingdom. Filming on the movie concluded on July 17, 2016, in London. Production then moved to Namibia for two weeks, with principal photography wrapping up on August 13, 2016.For the filming of the plane crash the production made use of The Vomit Comet and parabolic flight to simulate the illusion of weightlessness. The crew did a total of 64 takes with many of the crew becoming sick to their stomachs. Initially Kurtzman planned to shoot the scene entirely using wires and a rotating set, however Cruise\\'s insistence changed his mind.\\n\\nMusic\\nComposer Brian Tyler started work on the music for the movie early, writing about a half hour of music before filming even began. Working on the film for a year and half, Tyler recorded with an 84-piece orchestra and 32-voice choir at London\\'s Abbey Road. He ultimately wrote and recorded over two hours of music, which, given the length of the film (110 minutes), resulted in a soundtrack album longer than the film itself.\\n\\nRelease\\nInitially scheduled for a 2016 release, the film was released in the United States and Canada on June 9, 2017, with international roll out beginning the same day. The film was screened in various formats, such as 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D.On December 20, 2016, IMAX released a trailer with the wrong audio track attached; this unintentionally prompted the creation of memes and video montages featuring the mistakenly included audio track, which was missing most of the sound effects and instead featured Tom Cruise\\'s grunts and screams. IMAX reacted by taking down the trailer and issuing DMCA takedown notices in an attempt to stop it from spreading.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nThe Mummy grossed $80.2 million in the United States and Canada and $329.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $410 million. Due to a combined production and marketing cost of $345 million, it was estimated the film needed to gross $450 million in order to break-even, and ended up losing the studio between $60–100 million.In North America, the film was released alongside It Comes at Night and Megan Leavey and was originally projected to gross  $35–40 million from 4,034 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after making $12 million on its first day (including $2.66 million from Thursday night previews), weekend projections were lowered to $30 million. It ended up debuting to $31.7 million, marking the lowest of the Mummy franchise and finishing second at the box office behind Wonder Woman ($58.2 million in its second week). Deadline Hollywood attributed the film\\'s underperformance to poor critic and audience reactions, as well as \"blockbuster fatigue.\" In its second weekend the film made $14.5 million (dropping 54.2%), finishing 4th at the box office. It was pulled from 827 theaters in its third week and made $5.8 million, dropping another 60% and finishing 6th at the box office.Outside North America, the film opened in 63 overseas territories, with China, the UK, Mexico, Germany, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Russia receiving the film the same day as in North America, and was projected to debut to $125–135 million. It opened on June 6, 2017 in South Korea and grossed $6.6 million on its first day, the biggest-ever debut for both Tom Cruise and Universal in the country. It ended up having a foreign debut of $140.7 million, the biggest of Cruise\\'s career. In its opening weekend the film made $52.4 million in China, $7.4 million in Russia, $4.9 million in Mexico and $4.2 million in the United Kingdom. As of July 9, 2017, The film other big markets are China ($91.5 million), South Korea ($26.2 million), Russia and the CIS ($15.9 million) and Brazil ($13.2 million).\\n\\nCritical response\\nThe Mummy received generally negative reviews from critics, with criticism aimed at its narrative tone, acting, and plot points setting up the Dark Universe. On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 16% based on 310 reviews, with an average rating of 4.22/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads: \"Lacking the campy fun of the franchise\\'s most recent entries and failing to deliver many monster-movie thrills, The Mummy suggests a speedy unraveling for the Dark Universe.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B−\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 70% overall positive score.Vince Mancini of Uproxx gave the film a negative review, writing: \"If you like incomprehensible collections of things that vaguely resemble other things you might\\'ve enjoyed in the past, The Mummy is the movie for you.\" IndieWire\\'s David Ehrlich gave the film a D–, calling it the worst film of Cruise\\'s career and criticizing its lack of originality, saying: \"It\\'s one thing to excavate the iconography of old Hollywood, it\\'s another to exploit it. This isn\\'t filmmaking, it\\'s tomb-raiding.\"Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \"The problem at its heart is that the reality of what the movie is—a Tom Cruise vehicle—is at war with the material. The actor, at 54, is still playing that old Cruise trope, the selfish cocky semi-scoundrel who has to grow up. ... The trouble is that Cruise, at least in a high-powered potboiler like this one, is so devoted to maintaining his image as a clear and wholesome hero that his flirtation with the dark side is almost entirely theoretical.\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film one star out of four, saying: \"How meh is The Mummy? Let me count the ways. For all the huffing and puffing and digital desperation from overworked computers, this reboot lands onscreen with a resounding thud.\"Glen Kenny of RogerEbert.com gave the film 1.5/4 stars, writing: \"I found something almost admirable about the film\\'s cheek. It\\'s amazingly relentless in its naked borrowing from other, better horror and sci-fi movies that I was able to keep occupied making a checklist of the movies referenced.\" Entertainment Weekly\\'s Chis Nashawaty wrote that the film \"feels derivative and unnecessary and like it was written by committee.\"In BBC World News Culture, Nicholas Barber calls the film \"a mish-mash of wildly varying tones and plot strands, from its convoluted beginning to its shameless non-end. Tom Cruise\\'s new film barely qualifies as a film at all. None of it makes sense. The film delivers all the chases, explosions, zombies and ghosts you could ask for, and there are a few amusing lines and creepy moments, but, between the headache-inducing flashbacks and hallucinations, the narrative would be easier to follow if it were written in hieroglyphics.\"Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that the film \"has some nice moments but is basically a mess. The plot sags like an aeon-old decaying limb, a jumble of ideas and scenes from what look like different screenplay drafts,\" and concluded that \"It\\'s a ragbag of action scenes which needed to be bandaged more tightly.\"  Empire film magazine was more positive, with Dan Jolin awarding the film three stars. \"It\\'s running and jumping grin-flashing business as usual for Cruise, once more on safe character territory as an Ethan Hunt-esque action protagonist who couples up with a much younger woman, while another woman chases after him,\" he wrote. \"And if the next installment-teasing conclusion is anything to go by, Cruise seemed to have enough fun making this that he may just return for more.\"\\n\\nAccolades\\nVideo game\\nA video game based on the film, The Mummy Demastered, was released on October 24, 2017. It is a Metroidvania featuring a stand-alone story, which takes place concurrently with the events of the film and follows Prodigium soldiers under the command of Dr. Jekyll who fight the forces of Princess Ahmanet; unlike the film, it received positive reviews.\\n\\nCancelled franchise\\nThe film was part of Universal Pictures\\' Dark Universe, an attempt to create a modern cinematic universe based on the classic Universal Monsters film series. A remake of Bride of Frankenstein was originally scheduled for release on February 14, 2019, but on October 5, 2017, Universal decided to postpone it to allow more work to be done on the script. The 2014 film Dracula Untold was originally considered to be the first film in the series; however, since the film\\'s release, the connection to the Dark Universe was downplayed, and The Mummy was re-positioned as the first film in the series. By 2019, Universal announced plans to return to standalone features instead of using a shared film narrative, effectively ending the Dark Universe.\\n\\nNotes\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website\\nThe Mummy at IMDb\\nThe Mummy at AllMovie',\n",
              " 'The New York Times': 'The New York Times (NYT or NY Times) is an American daily newspaper based in New York City with a worldwide readership. Founded in 1851, the Times has since won 130 Pulitzer Prizes (the most of any newspaper), and has long been regarded within the industry as a national \"newspaper of record\". It is ranked 18th in the world by circulation and 3rd in the U.S.The paper is owned by The New York Times Company, which is publicly traded. It has been governed by the Sulzberger family since 1896, through a dual-class share structure after its shares became publicly traded. A. G. Sulzberger and his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.—the paper\\'s publisher and the company\\'s chairman, respectively—are the fourth and fifth generation of the family to head the paper.Since the mid-1970s, The New York Times has expanded its layout and organization, adding special weekly sections on various topics supplementing the regular news, editorials, sports, and features. Since 2008, the Times has been organized into the following sections: News, Editorials/Opinions-Columns/Op-Ed, New York (metropolitan), Business, Sports, Arts, Science, Styles, Home, Travel, and other features. On Sundays, the Times is supplemented by the Sunday Review (formerly the Week in Review), The New York Times Book Review, The New York Times Magazine, and T: The New York Times Style Magazine.The Times stayed with the broadsheet full-page set-up and an eight-column format for several years after most papers switched to six, and was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, especially on the front page. The paper\\'s motto, \"All the News That\\'s Fit to Print\", appears in the upper left-hand corner of the front page.\\n\\nHistory\\nOrigins\\nThe New York Times was founded as the New-York Daily Times on September 18, 1851. Founded by journalist and politician Henry Jarvis Raymond and former banker George Jones, the Times was initially published by Raymond, Jones & Company. Early investors in the company included Edwin B. Morgan, Christopher Morgan, and Edward B. Wesley. Sold for a penny (equivalent to 31¢ today), the inaugural edition attempted to address various speculations on its purpose and positions that preceded its release:\\nWe shall be Conservative, in all cases where we think Conservatism essential to the public good;—and we shall be Radical in everything which may seem to us to require radical treatment and radical reform. We do not believe that everything in Society is either exactly right or exactly wrong;—what is good we desire to preserve and improve;—what is evil, to exterminate, or reform.\\nIn 1852, the newspaper started a western division, The Times of California, which arrived whenever a mail boat from New York docked in California. However, the effort failed once local California newspapers came into prominence.On September 14, 1857, the newspaper officially shortened its name to The New-York Times. The hyphen in the city name was dropped on December 1, 1896. On April 21, 1861, The New York Times began publishing a Sunday edition to offer daily coverage of the Civil War. One of the earliest public controversies it was involved with was the Mortara Affair, the subject of twenty editorials in the Times alone.The main office of The New York Times was attacked during the New York City draft riots. The riots, sparked by the institution of a draft for the Union Army, began on July 13, 1863. On \"Newspaper Row\", across from City Hall, co-founder Henry Raymond stopped the rioters with Gatling guns, early machine guns, one of which he manned himself. The mob diverted, instead attacking the headquarters of abolitionist publisher Horace Greeley\\'s New York Tribune until being forced to flee by the Brooklyn City Police, who had crossed the East River to help the Manhattan authorities.In 1869, Henry Raymond died, and George Jones took over as publisher.\\n\\nThe newspaper\\'s influence grew in 1870 and 1871, when it published a series of exposés on William Tweed, leader of the city\\'s Democratic Party — popularly known as \"Tammany Hall\" (from its early-19th-century meeting headquarters) — that led to the end of the Tweed Ring\\'s domination of New York\\'s City Hall. Tweed had offered The New York Times five million dollars (equivalent to 107 million dollars in 2019) to not publish the story.In the 1880s, The New York Times gradually transitioned from supporting Republican Party candidates in its editorials to becoming more politically independent and analytical. In 1884, the paper supported Democrat Grover Cleveland (former mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York) in his first presidential campaign. While this move cost The New York Times a portion of its readership among its more progressive and Republican readers (revenue declined from $188,000 to $56,000 from 1883 to 1884), the paper eventually regained most of its lost ground within a few years.\\n\\nOchs era\\nAfter George Jones died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller and other New York Times editors raised $1 million (equivalent to $28 million in 2019) to buy the Times, printing it under the New York Times Publishing Company. However, the newspaper found itself in a financial crisis by the Panic of 1893, and by 1896, the newspaper had a circulation of less than 9,000, and was losing $1,000 a day. That year, Adolph Ochs, the publisher of the Chattanooga Times, gained a controlling interest in the company for $75,000.Shortly after assuming control of the paper, Ochs coined the paper\\'s slogan, \"All The News That\\'s Fit To Print\". The slogan has appeared in the paper since September 1896, and has been printed in a box in the upper left hand corner of the front page since early 1897. The slogan was a jab at competing papers, such as Joseph Pulitzer\\'s New York World and William Randolph Hearst\\'s New York Journal, which were known for a lurid, sensationalist and often inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions, described by the end of the century as \"yellow journalism\". Under Ochs\\' guidance, aided by Carr Van Anda, The New York Times achieved international scope, circulation, and reputation; Sunday circulation went from under 9,000 in 1896 to 780,000 in 1934. In 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, The New York Times, along with The Times, received the first on-the-spot wireless telegraph transmission from a naval battle: a report of the destruction of the Russian Navy\\'s Baltic Fleet, at the Battle of Port Arthur, from the press-boat Haimun. In 1910, the first air delivery of The New York Times to Philadelphia began. In 1919, The New York Times\\' first trans-Atlantic delivery to London occurred by dirigible balloon. In 1920, during the 1920 Republican National Convention, a \"4 A.M. Airplane Edition\" was sent to Chicago by plane, so it could be in the hands of convention delegates by evening.\\n\\nPost-war expansion\\nOchs died in 1935, and was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. Under his leadership, and that of his son-in-law (and successor), Orvil Dryfoos, the paper extended its breadth and reach, beginning in the 1940s. The crossword began appearing regularly in 1942, and the fashion section first appeared in 1946. The New York Times began an international edition in 1946. (The international edition stopped publishing in 1967, when The New York Times joined the owners of the New York Herald Tribune and The Washington Post to publish the International Herald Tribune in Paris.)\\nDryfoos died in 1963, and was succeeded as publisher by his brother-in-law, Arthur Ochs \"Punch\" Sulzberger, who led the Times until 1992, and continued the expansion of the paper.\\n\\nNew York Times v. Sullivan (1964)\\nThe paper\\'s involvement in a 1964 libel case helped bring one of the key United States Supreme Court decisions supporting freedom of the press, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. In it, the United States Supreme Court established the \"actual malice\" standard for press reports about public officials or public figures to be considered defamatory or libelous. The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case to prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. Because of the high burden of proof on the plaintiff, and difficulty in proving malicious intent, such cases by public figures rarely succeed.\\n\\nThe Pentagon Papers (1971)\\nIn 1971, the Pentagon Papers, a secret United States Department of Defense history of the United States\\' political and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1967, were given (\"leaked\") to Neil Sheehan of The New York Times by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg, with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them. The New York Times began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting airstrikes over Laos, raids along the coast of North Vietnam, and offensive actions were taken by the U.S. Marines well before the public was told about the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the ongoing war.When The New York Times began publishing its series, President Richard Nixon became incensed. His words to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included \"People have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing\" and \"Let\\'s get the son-of-a-bitch in jail.\" After failing to get The New York Times to stop publishing, Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that The New York Times cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system.\\nOn June 18, 1971, The Washington Post began publishing its own series. Ben Bagdikian, a Post editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the Post received a call from William Rehnquist, an assistant U.S. Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, asking them to stop publishing. When the Post refused, the U.S. Justice Department sought another injunction. The U.S. District court judge refused, and the government appealed.\\nOn June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into New York Times Co. v. United States. On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech, many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake.\\n\\nLate 1970s–90s\\nIn the 1970s, the paper introduced a number of new lifestyle sections including Weekend and Home, with the aim of attracting more advertisers and readers. Many criticized the move for betraying the paper\\'s mission. On September 7, 1976, the paper switched from an eight-column format to a six-column format. The overall page width stayed the same, with each column becoming wider. On September 14, 1987, the Times printed the heaviest ever newspaper, at over 12 pounds (5.4 kg) and 1,612 pages.In 1992, \"Punch\" Sulzberger stepped down as publisher; his son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., succeeded him, first as publisher, and then as Chairman of the Board in 1997. The Times was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, with the first color photograph on the front page appearing on October 16, 1997.\\n\\nDigital era\\nEarly digital content\\nThe New York Times switched to a digital production process sometime before 1980, but only began preserving the resulting digital text that year. In 1983, the Times sold the electronic rights to its articles to LexisNexis. As the online distribution of news increased in the 1990s, the Times decided not to renew the deal and in 1994 the newspaper regained electronic rights to its articles. On January 22, 1996, NYTimes.com began publishing.\\n\\n2000s\\nIn September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, while Sports continues to be printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times can allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper includes more than four sections on all days with the exception of Saturday, the sections were required to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes allowed The New York Times to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times\\' announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions would remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.In 2009, the newspaper began production of local inserts in regions outside of the New York area. Beginning October 16, 2009, a two-page \"Bay Area\" insert was added to copies of the Northern California edition on Fridays and Sundays. The newspaper commenced production of a similar Friday and Sunday insert to the Chicago edition on November 20, 2009. The inserts consist of local news, policy, sports, and culture pieces, usually supported by local advertisements.\\nFollowing industry trends, its weekday circulation had fallen in 2009 to fewer than one million.In August 2007, the paper reduced the physical size of its print edition, cutting the page width from 13.5 inches (34 cm) to a 12 inches (30 cm). This followed similar moves by a roster of other newspapers in the previous ten years, including USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. The move resulted in a 5% reduction in news space, but (in an era of dwindling circulation and significant advertising revenue losses) also saved about $12 million a year.Because of its declining sales largely attributed to the rise of news sources online, used especially by younger readers, and the decline of advertising revenue, the newspaper has been going through a downsizing for several years, offering buyouts to workers and cutting expenses, in common with a general trend among print news media.\\n\\n2010s\\nIn December 2012, the Times published \"Snow Fall\", a six-part article about the 2012 Tunnel Creek avalanche which integrated videos, photos, and interactive graphics and was hailed as a watershed moment for online journalism.In 2016, reporters for the newspaper were reportedly the target of cybersecurity breaches. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was reportedly investigating the attacks. The cybersecurity breaches have been described as possibly being related to cyberattacks that targeted other institutions, such as the Democratic National Committee.During the 2016 presidential election, the Times played an important role in elevating the Hillary Clinton emails controversy into the most important subject of media coverage in the election which Clinton would lose narrowly to Donald Trump. The controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the presidential campaign. Clinton and other observers argue that coverage of the emails controversy contributed to her loss in the election. According to a Columbia Journalism Review analysis, \"in just six days, The New York Times ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton\\'s emails as they did about all policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election (and that does not include the three additional articles on October 18, and November 6 and 7, or the two articles on the emails taken from John Podesta).\"In October 2018, the Times published a 14,218-word investigation into Donald Trump\\'s \"self-made\" fortune and tax avoidance, an 18-month project based on examination of 100,000 pages of documents. The extensive article ran as an eight-page feature in the print edition and also was adapted into a shortened 2,500 word listicle featuring its key takeaways. After the midweek front-page story, the Times also republished the piece as a 12-page \"special report\" section in the Sunday paper. During the lengthy investigation, Showtime cameras followed the Times\\' three investigative reporters for a half-hour documentary called The Family Business: Trump and Taxes, which aired the following Sunday. The report won a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting.In May 2019, The New York Times announced that it would present a television news program based on news from its individual reporters stationed around the world and that it would premiere on FX and Hulu.\\n\\nHeadquarters building\\nThe newspaper\\'s first building was located at 113 Nassau Street in New York City. In 1854, it moved to 138 Nassau Street, and in 1858 to 41 Park Row, making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use.The newspaper moved its headquarters to the Times Tower, located at 1475 Broadway in 1904, in an area then called Longacre Square, that was later renamed Times Square the newspaper\\'s honor. The top of the building –  now known as One Times Square –  is the site of the New Year\\'s Eve tradition of lowering a lighted ball, which was begun by the paper. The building is also known for its electronic news ticker –  popularly known as \"The Zipper\" –  where headlines crawl around the outside of the building. It is still in use, but has been operated by Dow Jones & Company since 1995. After nine years in its Times Square tower, the newspaper had an annex built at 229 West 43rd Street. After several expansions, the 43rd Street building became the newspaper\\'s main headquarters in 1960 and the Times Tower on Broadway was sold the following year. It served as the newspaper\\'s main printing plant until 1997, when the newspaper opened a state-of-the-art printing plant in the College Point section of the borough of Queens.A decade later, The New York Times moved its newsroom and businesses headquarters from West 43rd Street to a new tower at 620 Eighth Avenue between West 40th and 41st Streets, in Manhattan –  directly across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The new headquarters for the newspaper, known officially as The New York Times Building but unofficially called the new \"Times Tower\" by many New Yorkers, is a skyscraper designed by Renzo Piano.In August 2019, Slate magazine obtained an internal NYT email which reported evidence of bedbug activity was found on all floors of the newsroom.\\n\\nGender discrimination in employment\\nDiscriminatory practices used by the paper long restricted women in appointments to editorial positions. The newspaper\\'s first general female reporter was Jane Grant, who described her experience afterward: \"In the beginning I was charged not to reveal the fact that a female had been hired\". Other reporters nicknamed her Fluff and she was subjected to considerable hazing. Because of her gender, any promotion was out of the question, according to the then-managing editor. She remained on the staff for fifteen years, interrupted by World War I.In 1935, Anne McCormick wrote to Arthur Hays Sulzberger: \"I hope you won\\'t expect me to revert to \\'woman\\'s-point-of-view\\' stuff.\" Later, she interviewed major political leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues. Even witnesses of her actions were unable to explain how she gained the interviews she did. Clifton Daniel said, \"[After World War II,] I\\'m sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment.\"Covering world leaders\\' speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed to hear the speeches directly, they were still not allowed to ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work. Times reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the club after covering one speech on assignment. Nan Robertson\\'s article on the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said: \"\\'It will come as a surprise to you, perhaps, that the reporter is a girl,\\' he began... [G]asps; amazement in the ranks. \\'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.\\'\" The New York Times hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the Chicago Tribune, where \"[s]he did a series on maids, going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs.\"\\n\\nSlogan\\nThe New York Times has had one slogan. Since 1896, the newspaper\\'s slogan has been \"All the News That\\'s Fit to Print.\" In 1896, Adolph Ochs held a competition to attempt to find a replacement slogan, offering a $100 prize for the best one. Though he later announced that the original would not be changed, the prize would still be awarded. Entries included \"News, Not Nausea\"; \"In One Word: Adequate\"; \"News Without Noise\"; \"Out Heralds The Herald, Informs The World, and Extinguishes The Sun\"; \"The Public Press is a Public Trust\"; and the winner of the competition, \"All the world\\'s news, but not a school for scandal.\" On May 10, 1960, Wright Patman asked the FTC to investigate whether The New York Times\\'s slogan was misleading or false advertising. Within 10 days, the FTC responded that it was not.Again in 1996, a competition was held to find a new slogan, this time for NYTimes.com. Over 8,000 entries were submitted. Again however, \"All the News That\\'s Fit to Print,\" was found to be the best.\\n\\nOrganization\\nNews staff\\nIn addition to its New York City headquarters, the paper has newsrooms in London and Hong Kong. Its Paris newsroom, which had been the headquarters of the paper\\'s international edition, was closed in 2016, although the city remains home to a news bureau and an advertising office. The paper also has an editing and wire service center in Gainesville, Florida.As of 2013, the newspaper had six news bureaus in the New York region, 14 elsewhere in the United States, and 24 in other countries.In 2009, Russ Stanton, editor of the Los Angeles Times, a competitor, stated that the newsroom of The New York Times was twice the size of the Los Angeles Times, which had a newsroom of 600 at the time.To facilitate their reporting and to hasten an otherwise lengthy process of reviewing many documents during preparation for publication, their interactive news team has adapted optical character recognition technology into a proprietary tool known as Document Helper. It enables the team to accelerate the processing of documents that need to be reviewed. During March 2019, they documented that this tool enabled them to process 900 documents in less than ten minutes in preparation for reporters to review the contents.\\n\\nOchs-Sulzberger family\\nIn 1896, Adolph Ochs bought The New York Times, a money-losing newspaper, and formed the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, one of the United States\\' newspaper dynasties, has owned The New York Times ever since. The publisher went public on January 14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the American Stock Exchange. After this, the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of Class B voting shares. Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights, while Class B shareholders are allowed open voting rights.\\nThe Ochs-Sulzberger family trust controls roughly 88 percent of the company\\'s class B shares. Any alteration to the dual-class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit on the board of the Ochs-Sulzberger family trust. The Trust board members are Daniel H. Cohen, James M. Cohen, Lynn G. Dolnick, Susan W. Dryfoos, Michael Golden, Eric M. A. Lax, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., and Cathy J. Sulzberger.Turner Catledge, the top editor at The New York Times from 1952 to 1968, wanted to hide the ownership influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos, he would erase the publisher\\'s identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher\\'s name from the memos, it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.\\n\\nPublic editors\\nThe position of public editor was established in 2003 to \"investigate matters of journalistic integrity\"; each public editor was to serve a two-year term. The post \"was established to receive reader complaints and question Times journalists on how they make decisions.\" The impetus for the creation of the public editor position was the Jayson Blair affair. Public editors were: Daniel Okrent (2003–2005), Byron Calame (2005–2007), Clark Hoyt (2007–2010) (served an extra year), Arthur S. Brisbane (2010–2012), Margaret Sullivan (2012–2016) (served a four-year term), and Elizabeth Spayd (2016–2017). In 2017, the Times eliminated the position of public editor. Meredith Kopit Levien has been president and chief executive officer since September 2020.\\n\\nContent\\nEditorial stance\\nThe New York Times editorial page is often regarded as liberal. In mid-2004, the newspaper\\'s then public editor (ombudsman), Daniel Okrent, wrote that \"the Op-Ed page editors do an evenhanded job of representing a range of views in the essays from outsiders they publish – but you need an awfully heavy counterweight to balance a page that also bears the work of seven opinionated columnists, only two of whom could be classified as conservative (and, even then, of the conservative subspecies that supports legalization of gay unions and, in the case of William Safire, opposes some central provisions of the Patriot Act).\"The New York Times has not endorsed a Republican Party member for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956; since 1960, it has endorsed the Democratic Party nominee in every presidential election (see New York Times presidential endorsements). However, The New York Times did endorse incumbent moderate Republican mayors of New York City Rudy Giuliani in 1997, and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 and 2009. The Times also endorsed Republican New York state governor George Pataki for re-election in 2002.\\n\\nStyle\\nUnlike most U.S. daily newspapers, the Times relies on its own in-house stylebook rather than The Associated Press Stylebook. When referring to people, The New York Times generally uses honorifics rather than unadorned last names (except in the sports pages, pop culture coverage, Book Review and Magazine).The New York Times printed a display advertisement on its first page on January 6, 2009, breaking tradition at the paper. The advertisement, for CBS, was in color and ran the entire width of the page. The newspaper promised it would place first-page advertisements on only the lower half of the page.In August 2014, the Times decided to use the word \"torture\" to describe incidents in which interrogators \"inflicted pain on a prisoner in an effort to get information.\" This was a shift from the paper\\'s previous practice of describing such practices as \"harsh\" or \"brutal\" interrogations.The paper maintains a strict profanity policy. A 2007 review of a concert by the punk band Fucked Up, for example, completely avoided mention of the group\\'s name. However, the Times has on occasion published unfiltered video content that includes profanity and slurs where it has determined that such video has news value. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, the Times did print the words \"fuck\" and \"pussy,\" among others, when reporting on the vulgar statements made by Donald Trump in a 2005 recording. Then-Times politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: \"It\\'s a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length.\" Ryan said the paper ultimately decided to publish it because of its news value and because \"[t]o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given that we would be running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said.\"\\n\\nProducts\\nPrint newspaper\\nIn the absence of a major headline, the day\\'s most important story generally appears in the top-right column, on the main page. The typefaces used for the headlines are custom variations of Cheltenham. The running text is set at 8.7 point Imperial.The newspaper is organized into three sections, including the magazine.\\n\\nNews: Includes International, National, Washington, Business, Technology, Science, Health, Sports, The Metro Section, Education, Weather, and Obituaries.\\nOpinion: Includes Editorials, Op-eds and Letters to the Editor.\\nFeatures: Includes Arts, Movies, Theater, Travel, NYC Guide, Food, Home & Garden, Fashion & Style, Crossword, The New York Times Book Review,  T: The New York Times Style Magazine, The New York Times Magazine, and Sunday Review.Some sections, such as Metro, are only found in the editions of the paper distributed in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-state area and not in the national or Washington, D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section.From 1851 to 2017, The New York Times published around 60,000 print issues containing about 3.5 million pages and 15 million articles.\\n\\nLike most other American newspapers, The New York Times has experienced a decline in circulation. Its printed weekday circulation dropped by 50 percent to 540,000 copies from 2005 to 2017.\\n\\nInternational Edition\\nThe New York Times International Edition is a print version of the paper tailored for readers outside the United States. Formerly a joint venture with The Washington Post named The International Herald Tribune, The New York Times took full ownership of the paper in 2002 and has gradually integrated it more closely into its domestic operations.\\n\\nWebsite\\nThe New York Times began publishing daily on the World Wide Web on January 22, 1996, \"offering readers around the world immediate access to most of the daily newspaper\\'s contents.\" The website had 555 million pageviews in March 2005. The domain nytimes.com attracted at least 146 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com study. In March 2009, The New York Times website ranked 59th by number of unique visitors, with over 20 million unique visitors, making it the most visited newspaper site with more than twice the number of unique visitors as the next most popular site.As of May 2009, nytimes.com produced 22 of the 50 most popular newspaper blogs.As of August 2020, the company had 6.5 million paid subscribers out of which 5.7 million were subscribed to its digital content. In the period April–June 2020, it added 669,000 new digital subscribers.\\n\\nFood section\\nThe food section is supplemented on the web by properties for home cooks and for out-of-home dining. The New York Times Cooking (cooking.nytimes.com; also available via iOS app) provides access to more than 17,000 recipes on file as of November 2016, and availability of saving recipes from other sites around the web. The newspaper\\'s restaurant search (nytimes.com/reviews/dining) allows online readers to search NYC area restaurants by cuisine, neighborhood, price, and reviewer rating. The New York Times has also published several cookbooks, including The Essential New York Times Cookbook: Classic Recipes for a New Century, published in late 2010.\\n\\nTimesSelect\\nIn September 2005, the paper decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns in a program known as TimesSelect, which encompassed many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, TimesSelect cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year, though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty. To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material, and at least one site once compiled links of reprinted material.On September 17, 2007, The New York Times announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site.Times columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized TimesSelect, with Friedman going so far as to say \"I hate it. It pains me enormously because it\\'s cut me off from a lot, a lot of people, especially because I have a lot of people reading me overseas, like in India ... I feel totally cut off from my audience.\"\\n\\nPaywall and digital subscriptions\\nIn addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, The New York Times news archives from 1987 to the present are available at no charge, as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain. Access to the Premium Crosswords section continues to require either home delivery or a subscription for $6.95 per month or $39.95 per year.\\nFalling print advertising revenue and projections of continued decline resulted in a \"metered paywall\" being instituted in 2011, regarded as modestly successful after garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about $100 million in revenue as of March 2012. As announced in March 2011, the paywall would charge frequent readers for access to its online content. Readers would be able to access up to 20 articles each month without charge. (Although beginning in April 2012, the number of free-access articles was halved to just ten articles per month.) Any reader who wanted to access more would have to pay for a digital subscription. This plan would allow free access for occasional readers but produce revenue from \"heavy\" readers. Digital subscription rates for four weeks range from $15 to $35 depending on the package selected, with periodic new subscriber promotions offering four-week all-digital access for as low as 99¢. Subscribers to the paper\\'s print edition get full access without any additional fee. Some content, such as the front page and section fronts remained free, as well as the Top News page on mobile apps.In January 2013, The New York Times\\' Public Editor Margaret M. Sullivan announced that for the first time in many decades, the paper generated more revenue through subscriptions than through advertising. In December 2017, the number of free articles per month was reduced from ten to five, as the first change to the metered paywall since 2012. An executive of The New York Times Company stated that the decision was motivated by \"an all-time high\" in the demand for journalism.The newspaper\\'s website was hacked on August 29, 2013, by the Syrian Electronic Army, a hacking group that supports the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The SEA managed to penetrate the paper\\'s domain name registrar, Melbourne IT, and alter DNS records for The New York Times, putting some of its websites out of service for hours.As of December 2017, The New York Times has a total of 3.5 million paid subscriptions in both print and digital versions, and more than 130 million monthly readers, more than double its audience two years previously.In February 2018, The New York Times Company reported increased revenue from the digital-only subscriptions, adding 157,000 new subscribers to a total of 2.6 million digital-only subscribers. Digital advertising also saw growth during this period. At the same time, advertising for the print version of the journal fell.\\n\\nMobile presence\\nApps\\nIn 2008, The New York Times was made available as an app for the iPhone and iPod Touch; as well as publishing an iPad app in 2010.  The app allowed users to download articles to their mobile device enabling them to read the paper even when they were unable to receive a signal. As of October 2010, The New York Times iPad app is ad-supported and available for free without a paid subscription, but translated into a subscription-based model in 2011.In 2010, The New York Times editors collaborated with students and faculty from New York University\\'s Studio 20 Journalism Masters program to launch and produce \"The Local East Village\", a hyperlocal blog designed to offer news \"by, for and about the residents of the East Village\". That same year, reCAPTCHA helped to digitize old editions of The New York Times.In 2010, the newspaper also launched an app for Android smartphones, followed later by an app for Windows Phones.Moreover, the Times was the first newspaper to offer a video game as part of its editorial content, Food Import Folly by Persuasive Games.\\n\\nThe Times Reader\\nThe Times Reader is a digital version of The New York Times, created via a collaboration between the newspaper and Microsoft. Times Reader takes the principles of print journalism and applies them to the technique of online reporting, using a series of technologies developed by Microsoft and their Windows Presentation Foundation team. It was announced in Seattle in April 2006, by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., Bill Gates, and Tom Bodkin.In 2009, the Times Reader 2.0 was rewritten in Adobe AIR. In December 2013, the newspaper announced that the Times Reader app would be discontinued as of January 6, 2014, urging readers of the app to instead begin using the subscription-only Today\\'s Paper app.\\n\\nPodcasts\\nThe New York Times began producing podcasts in 2006. Among the early podcasts were Inside The Times and Inside The New York Times Book Review. However, several of the Times\\' podcasts were cancelled in 2012.The Times returned to launching new podcasts in 2016, including Modern Love with WBUR. On January 30, 2017, The New York Times launched a news podcast, The Daily. In October 2018, NYT debuted The Argument with opinion columnists Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. It is a weekly discussion about a single issue explained from the left, center, and right of the political spectrum.\\n\\nNon-English versions\\nThe New York Times en Español (Spanish-language)\\nBetween February 2016 and September 2019, The New York Times launched a standalone Spanish language edition, The New York Times en Español. The Spanish-language version featured increased coverage of news and events in Latin America and Spain. The expansion into Spanish language news content allowed the newspaper to expand its audience into the Spanish speaking world and increase its revenue. The Spanish-language version was seen as a way to compete with the established El País newspaper of Spain, which bills itself the \"global newspaper in Spanish.\" Its Spanish version has a team of journalists in Mexico City as well as correspondents in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Miami, and Madrid, Spain. It was discontinued in September 2019, citing lack of financial success as the reason.\\n\\nChinese-language\\nIn June 2012, The New York Times introduced its first official foreign-language variant, cn.nytimes.com, a Chinese-language news site viewable in both traditional and simplified Chinese characters. The project was led by Craig S. Smith on the business side and Philip P. Pan on the editorial side, with content created by staff based in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong, though the server was placed outside of China to avoid censorship issues.The site\\'s initial success was interrupted in October that year following the publication of an investigative article by David Barboza about the finances of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao\\'s family. In retaliation for the article, the Chinese government blocked access to both nytimes.com and cn.nytimes.com inside the People\\'s Republic of China (PRC).\\nDespite Chinese government interference, the Chinese-language operations have continued to develop, adding a second site, cn.nytstyle.com, iOS and Android apps, and newsletters, all of which are accessible inside the PRC. The China operations also produce three print publications in Chinese. Traffic to cn.nytimes.com, meanwhile, has risen due to the widespread use of VPN technology in the PRC and to a growing Chinese audience outside mainland China. The New York Times articles are also available to users in China via the use of mirror websites, apps, domestic newspapers, and social media. The Chinese platforms now represent one of The New York Times\\' top five digital markets globally. The editor-in-chief of the Chinese platforms is Ching-Ching Ni.In March 2013, The New York Times and National Film Board of Canada announced a partnership titled A Short History of the Highrise, which will create four short documentaries for the Internet about life in high rise buildings as part of the NFB\\'s Highrise project, utilizing images from the newspaper\\'s photo archives for the first three films, and user-submitted images for the final film. The third project in the Short History of the Highrise series won a Peabody Award in 2013.\\n\\nTimesMachine\\nThe TimesMachine is a web-based archive of scanned issues of The New York Times from 1851 through 2002.Unlike The New York Times online archive, the TimesMachine presents scanned images of the actual newspaper. All non-advertising content can be displayed on a per-story basis in a separate PDF display page and saved for future reference. The archive is available to The New York Times subscribers, home delivery and/or digital.\\n\\nInterruptions\\nBecause of holidays, no editions were printed on November 23, 1851; January 2, 1852; July 4, 1852; January 2, 1853; and January 1, 1854.Because of strikes, the regular edition of The New York Times was not printed during the following periods:\\nDecember 9, 1962, to March 31, 1963. Only a western edition was printed because of the 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike.\\nSeptember 17, 1965, to October 10, 1965. An international edition was printed, and a weekend edition replaced the Saturday and Sunday papers.\\nAugust 10, 1978, to November 5, 1978. A multi-union strike shut down the three major New York City newspapers. No editions of The New York Times were printed. Two months into the strike, a parody of The New York Times called Not The New York Times was distributed in the city, with contributors such as Carl Bernstein, Christopher Cerf, Tony Hendra and George Plimpton.\\n\\nCriticism and controversies\\nFailure to report Ukraine famine\\nThe New York Times was criticized for the work of reporter Walter Duranty, who served as its Moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936. Duranty wrote a series of stories in 1931 on the Soviet Union and won a Pulitzer Prize for his work at that time; however, he has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine, most particularly the Ukrainian famine in the 1930s.In 2003, after the Pulitzer Board began a renewed inquiry, the Times hired Mark von Hagen, professor of Russian history at Columbia University, to review Duranty\\'s work. Von Hagen found Duranty\\'s reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to Stalinist propaganda. In comments to the press he stated, \"For the sake of The New York Times\\' honor, they should take the prize away.\"\\n\\nWorld War II\\nOn November 14, 2001, in The New York Times\\' 150th-anniversary issue, in an article entitled \"Turning Away From the Holocaust,\" former executive editor Max Frankel wrote:\\n\\n And then there was failure: none greater than the staggering, staining failure of The New York Times to depict Hitler\\'s methodical extermination of the Jews of Europe as a horror beyond all other horrors in World War II – a Nazi war within the war crying out for illumination. \\nAccording to Frankel, harsh judges of The New York Times \"have blamed \\'self-hating Jews\\' and \\'anti-Zionists\\' among the paper\\'s owners and staff.\" Frankel responded to this criticism by describing the fragile sensibilities of the Jewish owners of The New York Times:\\n\\n Then, too, papers owned by Jewish families, like The Times, were plainly afraid to have a society that was still widely anti-Semitic misread their passionate opposition to Hitler as a merely parochial cause. Even some leading Jewish groups hedged their appeals for rescue lest they be accused of wanting to divert wartime energies.\\nAt The Times, the reluctance to highlight the systematic slaughter of Jews was also undoubtedly influenced by the views of the publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. He believed strongly and publicly that Judaism was a religion, not a race or nationality – that Jews should be separate only in the way they worshiped. He thought they needed no state or political and social institutions of their own. He went to great lengths to avoid having The Times branded a Jewish newspaper. He resented other publications for emphasizing the Jewishness of people in the news. \\nIn the same article, Frankel quotes Laurel Leff, associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University, who concluded that the newspaper had downplayed Nazi Germany\\'s targeting of Jews for genocide. Her 2005 book Buried by the Times documents the paper\\'s tendency before, during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis\\' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of the newspaper\\'s Jewish publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, concerning Jewishness, antisemitism, and Zionism.Jerold Auerbach, a Guggenheim Fellow and Fulbright Lecturer, wrote in Print to Fit, The New York Times, Zionism and Israel, 1896-2016 that it was of utmost importance to Adolph Ochs, the first Jewish owner of the paper, that in spite of the persecution of Jews in Germany, The Times, through its reporting, should never be classified as a \"Jewish newspaper\".After Ochs\\' death in 1935, his son-in-law Arthur Hays Sulzberger became the publisher of The New York Times and maintained the understanding that no reporting should reflect on The Times as a Jewish newspaper. Sulzburger shared Ochs\\' concerns about the way Jews were perceived in American society. His apprehensions about judgement were manifested positively by his strong fidelity to the United States. At the same time, within the pages of The New York Times, Sulzburger refused to bring attention to Jews, including the refusal to identify Jews as major victims of the Nazi genocide. To be sure, many reports of Nazi-authored slaughter identified Jewish victims as \"persons.\" The Times even opposed the rescue of Jewish refugees and backed American constraint.During the war, The New York Times journalist William L. Laurence was \"on the payroll of the War Department\".\\n\\nAccusations of liberal bias\\nIn mid-2004, the newspaper\\'s then-public editor Daniel Okrent, wrote an opinion piece in which he said that The New York Times did have a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. He stated that this bias reflected the paper\\'s cosmopolitanism, which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City, writing that the coverage of the Times\\'s Arts & Leisure; Culture; and the Sunday Times Magazine trend to the left.If you\\'re examining the paper\\'s coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen-it-all; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide (devout Catholics, gun owners, Orthodox Jews, Texans); if your value system wouldn\\'t wear well on a composite New York Times journalist, then a walk through this paper can make you feel you\\'re traveling in a strange and forbidding world.Times public editor Arthur Brisbane wrote in 2012:When The Times covers a national presidential campaign, I have found that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance, and usually succeed in doing so. Across the paper\\'s many departments, though, so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism — for lack of a better term — that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of The Times.The New York Times public editor (ombudsman) Elizabeth Spayd wrote in 2016 that \"Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview\" and accuse it of harboring a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze the substance of the claim but did opine that the Times is \"part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources.\" Times executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, however:We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in The New York Times. I want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It\\'s a really difficult goal. Do we pull it off all the time? No.\\n\\n2016 election\\nDonald Trump has frequently criticized The New York Times on his Twitter account before and during his presidency; since November 2015, Trump has referred to the Times as \"the failing New York Times\" in a series of tweets. Despite Trump\\'s criticism, New York Times Company CEO Mark Thompson said that the paper had enjoyed soaring digital readership, with the fourth quarter of 2016 seeing the highest number of new digital subscribers to the newspaper since 2011. On October 23, 2019, Trump announced that he was canceling the White House subscription to both The New York Times and The Washington Post and would direct all federal agencies to drop their subscriptions as well.Critic Matt Taibbi accused The New York Times of favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the paper\\'s news coverage of the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. Responding to the complaints of many readers, The New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote that \"The Times has not ignored Mr. Sanders\\'s campaign, but it hasn\\'t always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate\\'s age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say.\" Times senior editor Carolyn Ryan defended both the volume of The New York Times coverage (noting that Sanders had received about the same amount of article coverage as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio) and its tone.\\n\\nJayson Blair plagiarism (2003)\\nIn May 2003, The New York Times reporter Jayson Blair was forced to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. Some critics contended that African-American Blair\\'s race was a major factor in his hiring and in The New York Times\\' initial reluctance to fire him.\\n\\nIraq War (2003–06)\\nThe Times supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On May 26, 2004, more than a year after the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change.The New York Times was involved in a significant controversy regarding the allegations surrounding Iraq and weapons of mass destruction in September 2002. A front-page story was authored by Judith Miller which claimed that the Iraqi government was in the process of developing nuclear weapons was published. Miller\\'s story was cited by officials such as Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, and Donald Rumsfeld as part of a campaign to commission the Iraq War. One of Miller\\'s prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006. In 2005, negotiating a private severance package with Sulzberger, Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the position of the Bush administration, for which The New York Times later apologized.\\n\\nHatfill v. New York Times Co. and Kristof (2005)\\nThe 1964 case of NYT v. Sullivan foreshadowed another major libel case, Steven J. Hatfill v. The New York Times Company, and Nicholas Kristof, resulting from the 2001 anthrax attacks (which included powder in an envelope opened by reporter Judith Miller inside the Times newsroom).Dr. Steven Hatfill became a public figure as a result of insinuations that he was the \"likely culprit\" put forth in Nicholas Kristof\\'s columns, which referenced the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation of the case. Dr. Hatfill sued him and the Times for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. After years of proceedings, the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari in the case, leaving Dr. Hatfill\\'s case dismissed since he had not proved malice on the part of the Times.The Times was involved in a similar case in which it agreed to pay a settlement to Dr. Wen Ho Lee who was falsely accused of espionage.\\n\\nIsraeli–Palestinian conflict\\nA 2003 study in the Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics concluded that The New York Times reporting was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians. A 2002 study published in the journal Journalism examined Middle East coverage of the Second Intifada over a one-month period in the Times, Washington Post and Chicago Tribune. The study authors said that the Times was \"the most slanted in a pro-Israeli direction\" with a bias \"reflected...in its use of headlines, photographs, graphics, sourcing practices, and lead paragraphs.\"For its coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As\\'ad AbuKhalil) have insisted that it is pro-Israel. The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity. A piece in which Thomas Friedman commented that praise awarded to Netanyahu during a speech at congress was \"paid for by the Israel lobby\" elicited an apology and clarification from its writer.\\nThe New York Times\\' public editor Clark Hoyt concluded in his January 10, 2009, column:Though the most vociferous supporters of Israel and the Palestinians do not agree, I think The New York Times, largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war, has tried its best to do a fair, balanced and complete job — and has largely succeeded.\\n\\nIran (2015)\\nA 2015 study found that The New York Times fed into an overarching tendency towards national bias. During the Iranian nuclear crisis the newspaper minimized the \"negative processes\" of the United States while overemphasizing similar processes of Iran. This tendency was shared by other papers such as The Guardian, Tehran Times, and the Fars News Agency, while Xinhua News Agency was found to be more neutral while at the same time mimicking the foreign policy of the People\\'s Republic of China.\\n\\nHiring practices (2016)\\nIn April 2016, two black female employees in their sixties filed a federal class-action lawsuit against The New York Times Company CEO Mark Thompson and chief revenue officer Meredith Levien, claiming age, gender, and racial discrimination. The plaintiffs claimed that the Times advertising department favored younger white employees over older black employees in making firing and promotion decisions. The Times said that the suit was \"entirely without merit\" and was \"a series of recycled, scurrilous and unjustified attacks.\" The plaintiffs\\' gender discrimination claims were subsequently dismissed by the court, and the court also later denied class certification as to the age and racial discrimination claims.\\n\\nElimination of copy editors (2018)\\nThe New York Times announced plans to eliminate copy editing roles from the production of its daily newspaper and website content in June 2018. Executive Editor Dean Baquet defended the cuts, saying that the Times needed to free up funds to hire more reporters by eliminating editing roles. (The opinion and magazine sections have still retained their copy editors.) The duties of copy editors—checking for style, grammar, factual correctness, tone, as well as writing headlines—were merged into all-purpose editing roles. Editors currently not only edit the content of the stories but also, in many cases, provide the final read before publication.\\nMany publications, such as the Chronicle of Higher Education, have suggested the elimination of copy editors has led to more mistakes, such as typos and factual errors, in the paper. The journalism research organization similarly suggested in a blog post that the elimination of copy editors would decrease internal expertise and hurt the quality of the daily news report.\\n\\nTom Cotton editorial (2020)\\nDuring the George Floyd protests in June 2020, the Times published an opinion piece by U.S. Senator Tom Cotton entitled \"Send in the Troops\", which called for the mobilization of the U.S. military in response to rioting, and for \"an overwhelming show of force to disperse, detain and ultimately deter lawbreakers\", and which contained claims about the protests that the Times had previously identified as misinformation. Several current and former Times reporters criticized the decision to publish the piece and accused the newspaper of publishing misinformation. The NewsGuild of New York said the piece encouraged violence and lacked context and vetting. A. G. Sulzberger and editorial page editor James Bennet defended the piece, but the paper later issued a statement saying the piece failed to meet its editorial standards and described its publication as the result of a \"rushed editorial process\". Bennet resigned days later.\\n\\nCancel Culture (2021)\\nThe Times was described as having implemented a cancel culture in 2021, when editor-in-chief Dean Baquet urged journalist Donald McNeil Jr. to quit. McNeil had been targeted by a report, which resulted in a request for his dismissal because he used the word \"nigger\" as a quote in a discussion on racism. Although the Times published a critique by Bret Stephens regarding this topic, another critique by him regarding the same issue, had been spiked.\\n\\nReputation\\nThe Times has developed a national and international \"reputation for thoroughness\" over time. Among journalists, the paper is held in high regard; a 1999 survey of newspaper editors conducted by the Columbia Journalism Review found that the Times was the \"best\" American paper, ahead of The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and Los Angeles Times. The Times also was ranked #1 in a 2011 \"quality\" ranking of U.S. newspapers by Daniel de Vise of The Washington Post; the objective ranking took into account the number of recent Pulitzer Prizes won, circulation, and perceived Web site quality. A 2012 report in WNYC called the Times \"the most respected newspaper in the world.\" Noam Chomsky, co-author of Manufacturing Consent, said that The New York Times was the first thing he looked at in the morning: \"Despite all its flaws—and they\\'re real—it still has the broadest, the most comprehensive coverage of I think any newspaper in the world.\"Nevertheless, like many other U.S. media sources, the Times had suffered from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the U.S. from 2004 to 2012. A Pew Research Center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations. Among respondents who gave a rating, 49% said that they believed \"all or most\" of the Times\\'s reporting, while 50% disagreed. A large percentage (19%) of respondents were unable to rate believability. The Times\\'s score was comparable to that of USA Today. Media analyst Brooke Gladstone of WNYC\\'s On the Media, writing for The New York Times, says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that \"Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation.\"\\n\\nAwards\\nThe New York Times has won 130 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper. The prize is awarded for excellence in journalism in a range of categories.It has also, as of 2014, won three Peabody Awards and jointly received two. Peabody Awards are given for accomplishments in television, radio, and online media.\\n\\nSee also\\nList of controversies involving The New York Times\\nList of New York City newspapers and magazines\\nList of The New York Times employees\\nThe New York Times Best Seller list\\nNew York Times Building (disambiguation)\\nThe New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge\\nNew York Times Index\\n Journalism portal\\n New York City portal\\n\\nReferences\\nNotes\\nCitations\\nFurther reading\\nDavis, Elmer Holmes (1921).

              " 'The New Yorker': 'The New Yorker is an American weekly magazine featuring journalism, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry. Started as a weekly in 1925, the magazine is now published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on the cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside New York and is read internationally. It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers, its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana, its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews, its rigorous fact checking and copy editing, its journalism on politics and social issues, and its single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe New Yorker was founded by Harold Ross and his wife Jane Grant, a New York Times reporter, and debuted on February 21, 1925. Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably \"corny\" humor publications such as Judge, where he had worked, or the old Life. Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann (who founded the General Baking Company) to establish the F-R Publishing Company. The magazine\\'s first offices were at 25 West 45th Street in Manhattan. Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951. During the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication. Ross famously declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine: \"It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"Although the magazine never lost its touches of humor, it soon established itself as a pre-eminent forum for serious fiction, essays and journalism. Shortly after the end of World War II, John Hersey\\'s essay Hiroshima filled an entire issue. In subsequent decades the magazine published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including Ann Beattie, Sally Benson, Truman Capote, John Cheever, Roald Dahl, Mavis Gallant, Geoffrey Hellman, Ruth McKenney, John McNulty, Joseph Mitchell, Alice Munro, Haruki Murakami, Vladimir Nabokov, John O\\'Hara, Dorothy Parker, S.J. Perelman, Philip Roth, George Saunders, J. D. Salinger, Irwin Shaw, James Thurber, John Updike, Eudora Welty, Stephen King, and E. B. White. Publication of Shirley Jackson\\'s \"The Lottery\" drew more mail than any other story in the magazine\\'s history.In its early decades, the magazine sometimes published two or even three short stories a week, but in recent years the pace has remained steady at one story per issue. While some styles and themes recur more often than others in its fiction, the stories are marked less by uniformity than by variety, and they have ranged from Updike\\'s introspective domestic narratives to the surrealism of Donald Barthelme, and from parochial accounts of the lives of neurotic New Yorkers to stories set in a wide range of locations and eras and translated from many languages. Kurt Vonnegut said that The New Yorker has been an effective instrument for getting a large audience to appreciate modern literature. Vonnegut\\'s 1974 interview with Joe David Bellamy and John Casey contained a discussion of The New Yorker\\'s influence:\\n\\n[T]he limiting factor [in literature] is the reader. No other art requires the audience to be a performer. You have to count on the reader\\'s being a good performer, and you may write music which he absolutely can\\'t perform—in which case it\\'s a bust. Those writers you mentioned and myself are teaching an audience how to play this kind of music in their heads. It\\'s a learning process, and The New Yorker has been a very good institution of the sort needed. They have a captive audience, and they come out every week, and people finally catch on to Barthelme, for instance, and are able to perform that sort of thing in their heads and enjoy it.\\nThe non-fiction feature articles (which usually make up the bulk of the magazine\\'s content) cover an eclectic array of topics. Recent subjects have included eccentric evangelist Creflo Dollar, the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time, and Münchausen syndrome by proxy.\\nThe magazine is notable for its editorial traditions. Under the rubric Profiles, it publishes articles about notable people such as Ernest Hemingway, Henry R. Luce and Marlon Brando, Hollywood restaurateur Michael Romanoff, magician Ricky Jay and mathematicians David and Gregory Chudnovsky. Other enduring features have been \"Goings on About Town\", a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York, and \"The Talk of the Town\", a miscellany of brief pieces—frequently humorous, whimsical or eccentric vignettes of life in New York—written in a breezily light style, or feuilleton, although in recent years the section often begins with a serious commentary. For many years, newspaper snippets containing amusing errors, unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors (\"Block That Metaphor\") have been used as filler items, accompanied by a witty retort. There is no masthead listing the editors and staff. Despite some changes, the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography, layout, covers and artwork. The magazine was acquired by Advance Publications, the media company owned by Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr, in 1985, for $200 million when it was earning less than $6 million a year.Ross was succeeded as editor by William Shawn (1951–87), followed by Robert Gottlieb (1987–92) and Tina Brown (1992–98). Among the important nonfiction authors who began writing for the magazine during Shawn\\'s editorship were Dwight Macdonald, Kenneth Tynan, and Hannah Arendt; to a certain extent all three authors were controversial, Arendt the most obviously so (her Eichmann in Jerusalem reportage appeared in the magazine before it was published as a book), but in each case Shawn proved an active champion.\\nBrown\\'s nearly six-year tenure attracted more controversy than Gottlieb\\'s or even Shawn\\'s, thanks to her high profile (Shawn, by contrast, had been an extremely shy, introverted figure) and the changes which she made to a magazine that had retained a similar look and feel for the previous half-century. She introduced color to the editorial pages (several years before The New York Times) and photography, with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout. More substantively, she increased the coverage of current events and hot topics such as celebrities and business tycoons, and placed short pieces throughout \"Goings on About Town\", including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan. A new letters-to-the-editor page and the addition of authors\\' bylines to their \"Talk of the Town\" pieces had the effect of making the magazine more personal. The current editor of The New Yorker is David Remnick, who succeeded Brown in July 1998.Tom Wolfe wrote about the magazine: \"The New Yorker style was one of leisurely meandering understatement, droll when in the humorous mode, tautological and litotical when in the serious mode, constantly amplified, qualified, adumbrated upon, nuanced and renuanced, until the magazine\\'s pale-gray pages became High Baroque triumphs of the relative clause and appository modifier\".Joseph Rosenblum, reviewing Ben Yagoda\\'s About Town, a history of the magazine from 1925 to 1985, wrote, \"... The New Yorker did create its own universe. As one longtime reader wrote to Yagoda, this was a place \\'where Peter DeVries ... [sic] was forever lifting a glass of Piesporter, where Niccolò Tucci (in a plum velvet dinner jacket) flirted in Italian with Muriel Spark, where Nabokov sipped tawny port from a prismatic goblet (while a Red Admirable perched on his pinky), and where John Updike tripped over the master\\'s Swiss shoes, excusing himself charmingly\\'\".As far back as the 1940s, the magazine\\'s commitment to fact-checking was already well-known. However, the magazine played a role in a literary scandal and defamation lawsuit over two articles written by Janet Malcolm in the 1990s, who wrote about Sigmund Freud\\'s legacy. Questions were raised about the magazine\\'s fact-checking process. As of 2010, The New Yorker employs sixteen fact checkers. In July 2011, the magazine was sued for defamation in United States district court for an article written by David Grann on July 12, 2010, but the case was summarily dismissed. Today, the magazine is often identified as the leading publication for rigorous fact checking.Since the late 1990s, The New Yorker has used the Internet to publish current and archived material, and maintains a website with some content from the current issue (plus exclusive web-only content). Subscribers have access to the full current issue online, as well as a complete archive of back issues viewable as they were originally printed. In addition, The New Yorker\\'s cartoons are available for purchase online. A digital archive of back issues from 1925 to April 2008 (representing more than 4,000 issues and half a million pages) has also been issued on DVD-ROMs and on a small portable hard drive. More recently, an iPad version of the current issue of the magazine has been released.\\n\\nInfluence\\nThe New Yorker influenced a number of similar magazines, including The Brooklynite (1926 to 1930), The Chicagoan (1926 to 1935), and Paris\\'s The Boulevardier (1927 to 1932).\\n\\nUnited States presidential election endorsements\\nIn its issue dated November 1, 2004, the magazine endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, choosing to endorse Democrat John Kerry over incumbent Republican George W. Bush.\\n\\nCartoons\\nThe New Yorker has featured cartoons (usually gag cartoons) since it began publication in 1925. The cartoon editor of The New Yorker for years was Lee Lorenz, who first began cartooning in 1956 and became a New Yorker contract contributor in 1958. After serving as the magazine\\'s art editor from 1973 to 1993 (when he was replaced by Françoise Mouly), he continued in the position of cartoon editor until 1998. His book The Art of the New Yorker: 1925–1995 (Knopf, 1995) was the first comprehensive survey of all aspects of the magazine\\'s graphics. In 1998, Robert Mankoff took over as cartoon editor and edited at least 14 collections of New Yorker cartoons. In addition, Mankoff usually contributed a short article to each book, describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine. Mankoff left the magazine in 2017.The New Yorker\\'s stable of cartoonists has included many important talents in American humor, including Charles Addams, Peter Arno, Charles Barsotti, George Booth, Roz Chast, Tom Cheney, Sam Cobean, Leo Cullum, Richard Decker, Pia Guerra, J. B. Handelsman, Helen E. Hokinson, Ed Koren, Burr Shafer, Reginald Marsh, Mary Petty, George Price, Charles Saxon, David Snell, Otto Soglow, Saul Steinberg, William Steig, James Stevenson, Richard Taylor, James Thurber, Pete Holmes, Barney Tobey, and Gahan Wilson.\\nMany early New Yorker cartoonists did not caption their own cartoons. In his book The Years with Ross, Thurber describes the newspaper\\'s weekly art meeting, where cartoons submitted over the previous week would be brought up from the mail room to be gone over by Ross, the editorial department, and a number of staff writers. Cartoons often would be rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments, while others would be accepted and captions written for them. Some artists hired their own writers; Helen Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in 1931. (Brendan Gill relates in his book Here at The New Yorker that at one point in the early 1940s, the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve. It later was found out that the office boy (a teen-aged Truman Capote) had been acting as a volunteer art editor, dropping pieces he didn\\'t like down the far edge of his desk.)Several of the magazine\\'s cartoons have climbed to a higher plateau of fame. One 1928 cartoon drawn by Carl Rose and captioned by E. B. White shows a mother telling her daughter, \"It\\'s broccoli, dear.\" The daughter responds, \"I say it\\'s spinach and I say the hell with it.\" The phrase \"I say it\\'s spinach\" entered the vernacular (and three years later, the Broadway musical Face the Music included Irving Berlin\\'s musical number entitled \"I Say It\\'s Spinach (And the Hell with It)\"). The catchphrase \"back to the drawing board\" originated with the 1941 Peter Arno cartoon showing an engineer walking away from a crashed plane, saying, \"Well, back to the old drawing board.\"The most reprinted is Peter Steiner\\'s 1993 drawing of two dogs at a computer, with one saying, \"On the Internet, nobody knows you\\'re a dog\". According to Mankoff, Steiner and the magazine have split more than $100,000 in fees paid for the licensing and reprinting of this single cartoon, with more than half going to Steiner.Over seven decades, many hardcover compilations of cartoons from The New Yorker have been published, and in 2004, Mankoff edited The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker, a 656-page collection with 2004 of the magazine\\'s best cartoons published during 80 years, plus a double CD set with all 68,647 cartoons ever published in the magazine. This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by a cartoonist\\'s name or by year of publication. The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includes Pat Byrnes, Frank Cotham, Michael Crawford, Joe Dator, Drew Dernavich, J. C. Duffy, Carolita Johnson, Zachary Kanin, Farley Katz, Robert Leighton, Glen Le Lievre, Michael Maslin, Ariel Molvig, Paul Noth, Barbara Smaller, David Sipress, Mick Stevens, Julia Suits, Christopher Weyant, P. C. Vey, and Jack Ziegler. The notion that some New Yorker cartoons have punchlines so non sequitur that they are impossible to understand became a subplot in the Seinfeld episode \"The Cartoon\", as well as a playful jab in an episode of The Simpsons, \"The Sweetest Apu\".\\nIn April 2005, the magazine began using the last page of each issue for \"The New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest\". Captionless cartoons by The New Yorker\\'s regular cartoonists are printed each week. Captions are submitted by readers, and three are chosen as finalists. Readers then vote on the winner. Anyone age thirteen or older can enter or vote. Each contest winner receives a print of the cartoon (with the winning caption), signed by the artist who drew the cartoon.\\n\\nCrosswords and puzzles\\nThe New Yorker launched a crossword puzzle series in April 2018 with a weekday crossword published every Monday. Subsequently, it launched a second, weekend crossword that appears on Fridays and relaunched cryptic puzzles that were run in the magazine in the late 1990s. The puzzles are written by a rotating stable of seven constructors. The crosswords integrate cartoons into the puzzle playing experience. The Christmas 2019 issue featured a crossword puzzle by Patrick Berry that had cartoons as clues, and the answers were captions for the cartoons. In December 2019, Liz Maynes-Aminzade was named the first puzzles and games editor of The New Yorker.\\n\\nFilms\\nThe New Yorker has been the source of a number of movies. Both fiction and non-fiction pieces have been adapted for the big screen, including Flash of Genius (2008), based on a true account of the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper by John Seabrook; Away From Her, adapted from Alice Munro\\'s short story \"The Bear Came over the Mountain\", which debuted at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival; The Namesake (2007), similarly based on Jhumpa Lahiri\\'s novel, which originated as a short story in the magazine; The Bridge (2006), based on Tad Friend\\'s 2003 non-fiction piece \"Jumpers\"; Brokeback Mountain (2005), an adaptation of the short story by Annie Proulx that first appeared in the October 13, 1997, issue of The New Yorker; Jonathan Safran Foer\\'s 2001 debut in The New Yorker, which later came to theaters in Liev Schreiber\\'s debut as both screenwriter and director, Everything Is Illuminated (2005); Michael Cunningham\\'s The Hours, which appeared in the pages of The New Yorker before becoming the film that garnered the 2002 Best Actress Academy Award for Nicole Kidman; Adaptation (2002), which Charlie Kaufman based on Susan Orlean\\'s The Orchid Thief, written for The New Yorker; Frank McCourt\\'s Angela\\'s Ashes, which also appeared, in part, in The New Yorker in 1996 before its film adaptation was released in 1999; The Addams Family (1991) and its sequel, Addams Family Values (1993), both inspired by the work of famed New Yorker cartoonist Charles Addams; Brian De Palma\\'s Casualties of War (1989), which began as a New Yorker article by Daniel Lang; Boys Don\\'t Cry (1999), starring Hilary Swank, began as an article in the magazine, and Iris (2001), about the life of Iris Murdoch and John Bayley, the article written by John Bayley for The New Yorker, before he completed his full memoir, the film starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent; The Swimmer (1968), starring Burt Lancaster, based on a John Cheever short story from The New Yorker; In Cold Blood (1967), the widely nominated adaptation of the 1965 non-fiction serial written for The New Yorker by Truman Capote; Pal Joey (1957), based on a series of stories by John O\\'Hara; Mister 880 (1950), starring Edmund Gwenn, based on a story by longtime editor St. Clair McKelway; The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947), which began as a story by longtime New Yorker contributor James Thurber; and Junior Miss (1941) and Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), both adapted from Sally Benson\\'s short stories.\\nThe history of The New Yorker has also been portrayed in film: In Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle, a film about the celebrated Algonquin Round Table starring Jennifer Jason Leigh as Dorothy Parker, Sam Robards portrays founding editor Harold Ross trying to drum up support for his fledgling publication. The magazine\\'s former editor, William Shawn, is portrayed in Capote (2005), Infamous (2006) and Hannah Arendt (2012).\\nThe 2015 documentary Very Semi-Serious, produced by Redora Films, presents a behind-the-scenes look at the cartoons of The New Yorker.\\n\\nStyle\\nThe New Yorker\\'s signature display typeface, used for its nameplate and headlines and the masthead above The Talk of the Town section, is Irvin, named after its creator, the designer-illustrator Rea Irvin. The body text of all articles in The New Yorker is set in Adobe Caslon.One uncommonly formal feature of the magazine\\'s in-house style is the placement of diaeresis marks in words with repeating vowels—such as reëlected, preëminent, and coöperate—in which the two vowel letters indicate separate vowel sounds. The magazine also continues to use a few spellings that are otherwise little used in American English, such as fuelled, focussed, venders, teen-ager, traveller, marvellous, carrousel, and cannister.The magazine also spells out the names of numerical amounts, such as \"two million three hundred thousand dollars\" instead of \"$2.3 million\", even for very large figures.\\n\\nReadership\\nDespite its title, The New Yorker is read nationwide, with 53 percent of its circulation in the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas. According to Mediamark Research Inc., the average age of The New Yorker reader in 2009 was 47 (compared to 43 in 1980 and 46 in 1990). The average household income of The New Yorker readers in 2009 was $109,877 (the average income in 1980 was $62,788 and the average income in 1990 was $70,233).According to Pew Research, 77 percent of The New Yorker\\'s audience hold left-of-center political values, while 52 percent of those readers hold \"consistently liberal\" political values.\\n\\nEustace Tilley\\nThe magazine\\'s first cover illustration, a dandy peering at a butterfly through a monocle, was drawn by Rea Irvin, the magazine\\'s first art editor, based on an 1834 caricature of the then Count d\\'Orsay which appeared as an illustration in the 11th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. The gentleman on the original cover, now referred to as \"Eustace Tilley\", is a character created by Corey Ford (1902–1969) for The New Yorker. The hero of a series entitled \"The Making of a Magazine\", which began on the inside front cover of the August 8 issue that first summer, Tilley was a younger man than the figure on the original cover. His top hat was of a newer style, without the curved brim. He wore a morning coat and striped formal trousers. Ford borrowed Eustace Tilley\\'s last name from an aunt—he had always found it vaguely humorous. \"Eustace\" was selected by Ford for euphony.The character has become a kind of mascot for The New Yorker, frequently appearing in its pages and on promotional materials. Traditionally, Rea Irvin\\'s original Tilley cover illustration is used every year on the issue closest to the anniversary date of February 21, though on several occasions a newly drawn variation has been substituted.\\n\\nCovers\\nThe magazine is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers.\\n\\n\"View of the World\" cover\\nSaul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for the magazine. His most famous work is probably its March 29, 1976, cover, an illustration most often referred to as \"View of the World from 9th Avenue\", sometimes referred to as \"A Parochial New Yorker\\'s View of the World\" or \"A New Yorker\\'s View of the World\", which depicts a map of the world as seen by self-absorbed New Yorkers.\\nThe illustration is split in two, with the bottom half of the image showing Manhattan\\'s 9th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and the Hudson River (appropriately labeled), and the top half depicting the rest of the world. The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square, with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing \"Jersey\", the names of five cities (Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Las Vegas; Kansas City; and Chicago) and three states (Texas, Utah, and Nebraska) scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey. The Pacific Ocean, perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson, separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia.\\nThe illustration—humorously depicting New Yorkers\\' self-image of their place in the world, or perhaps outsiders\\' view of New Yorkers\\' self-image—inspired many similar works, including the poster for the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 706 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright that Steinberg held on his work.\\nThe cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of The New Yorker on October 6, 2008. The cover featured Sarah Palin looking out of her window seeing only Alaska, with Russia in the far background.The March 21, 2009, cover of The Economist, \"How China sees the World\", is also an homage to the original image, depicting the viewpoint from Beijing\\'s Chang\\'an Avenue instead of Manhattan.\\n\\n9/11\\nHired by Tina Brown in 1992, Art Spiegelman worked for The New Yorker for ten years but resigned a few months after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The cover created by Françoise Mouly and Spiegelman for the September 24, 2001, issue of The New Yorker received wide acclaim and was voted as being among the top ten magazine covers of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors, which commented:\\n\\nNew Yorker Covers Editor Françoise Mouly repositioned Art Spiegelman\\'s silhouettes, inspired by Ad Reinhardt\\'s black-on-black paintings, so that the North Tower\\'s antenna breaks the \"W\" of the magazine\\'s logo. Spiegelman wanted to see the emptiness, and find the awful/awe-filled image of all that disappeared on 9/11. The silhouetted Twin Towers were printed in a fifth, black ink, on a field of black made up of the standard four color printing inks. An overprinted clear varnish helps create the ghost images that linger, insisting on their presence through the blackness.\\nAt first glance, the cover appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a slightly darker shade of black. In some situations, the ghost images become visible only when the magazine is tilted toward a light source. In September 2004, Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his book In the Shadow of No Towers, in which he relates his experience of the Twin Towers attack and the psychological after-effects.\\n\\n\"New Yorkistan\"\\nIn the December 2001 issue, the magazine printed a cover by Maira Kalman and Rick Meyerowitz showing a map of New York in which various neighborhoods were labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood\\'s real name or characteristics (e.g., \"Fuhgeddabouditstan\", \"Botoxia\"). The cover had some cultural resonance in the wake of September 11, and became a popular print and poster.\\n\\nControversial covers\\nCrown Heights in 1993\\nFor the 1993 Valentine\\'s Day issue, the magazine cover by Art Spiegelman depicted a black woman and a Hasidic Jewish man kissing, referencing the Crown Heights riot of 1991. The cover was criticized by both black and Jewish observers. Jack Salzman and Cornel West describe the reaction to the cover as the magazine\\'s \"first national controversy\".\\n\\n2008 Obama cover satire and controversy\\n\"The Politics of Fear\", a cartoon by Barry Blitt featured on the cover of the July 21, 2008, issue, depicts then presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama in the turban and shalwar kameez typical of many Muslims, fist bumping with his wife, Michelle, portrayed with an Afro and wearing camouflage trousers with an assault rifle slung over her back. They are standing in the Oval Office, with a portrait of Osama Bin Laden hanging on the wall and an American flag burning in the fireplace in the background.Many New Yorker readers saw the image as a lampoon of \"The Politics of Fear\", as was its title. Some of Obama\\'s supporters as well as his presumptive Republican opponent, Sen. John McCain, accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers. However, editor David Remnick felt the image\\'s obvious excesses rebuffed the concern that it could be misunderstood, even by those unfamiliar with the magazine. \"The intent of the cover\", he said, \"is to satirize the vicious and racist attacks and rumors and misconceptions about the Obamas that have been floating around in the blogosphere and are reflected in public opinion polls. What we set out to do was to throw all these images together, which are all over the top and to shine a kind of harsh light on them, to satirize them.\"In an interview on Larry King Live shortly after the magazine issue began circulating, Obama said, \"Well, I know it was The New Yorker\\'s attempt at satire... I don\\'t think they were entirely successful with it\". Obama also pointed to his own efforts to debunk the allegations portrayed in The New Yorker cover through a web site his campaign set up, stating that the allegations were \"actually an insult against Muslim-Americans\".Later that week, The Daily Show\\'s Jon Stewart continued The New Yorker cover\\'s argument about Obama stereotypes with a piece showcasing a montage of clips containing such stereotypes culled from various legitimate news sources. The New Yorker Obama cover was later parodied by Stewart and Stephen Colbert on the October 3, 2008, cover of Entertainment Weekly magazine, with Stewart as Obama and Colbert as Michelle, photographed for the magazine in New York City on September 18.New Yorker covers are not always related to the contents of the magazine or are only tangentially so. In this case, the article in the July 21, 2008, issue about Obama did not discuss the attacks and rumors but rather Obama\\'s political career. The magazine later endorsed Obama for president.\\nThis parody was most likely inspired by Fox News host E. D. Hill\\'s paraphrasing of an anonymous internet comment in asking whether a gesture made by Obama and his wife Michelle was a \"terrorist fist jab\". Later, Hill\\'s contract was not renewed.\\n\\n2013 Bert and Ernie cover\\nThe New Yorker chose an image of Bert and Ernie by artist Jack Hunter, entitled \"Moment of Joy\", as the cover of their July 8, 2013, publication, which covers the Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and California Proposition 8. The Sesame Street characters have long been rumored in popular culture and urban legend to be homosexual partners, though Sesame Workshop has repeatedly denied this, saying they are merely \"puppets\" and have no sexual orientation. Reaction was mixed. Online magazine Slate criticized the cover, which shows Ernie leaning on Bert\\'s shoulder as they watch a television with the Supreme Court justices on the screen, saying \"it\\'s a terrible way to commemorate a major civil-rights victory for gay and lesbian couples.\" The Huffington Post, meanwhile, said it was \"one of [the magazine\\'s] most awesome covers of all time\".\\n\\nBooks\\nRoss and The New Yorker by Dale Kramer (1951)\\nThe Years with Ross by James Thurber (1959)\\nRoss, The New Yorker and Me by Jane Grant (1968)\\nHere at The New Yorker by Brendan Gill (1975)\\nAbout the New Yorker and Me by E.J.

              " 'The Others (2001 film)': 'The Others (Spanish: Los otros) is a 2001 English-language Spanish gothic supernatural psychological horror film. It was written, directed, and scored by Alejandro Amenábar. It stars Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Elaine Cassidy, Eric Sykes, Alakina Mann and James Bentley.\\nThe Others was theatrically released in the United States on August 2, 2001, by Dimension Films and in Spain on September 7, 2001, by Warner Sogefilms. The film was a box-office success, grossing over $209.9 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, with many praising Amenábar\\'s direction and screenplay, as well as the musical score, atmosphere and Kidman\\'s performance.\\nThe film won seven Goya Awards, including awards for Best Film and Best Director. This was the first English-language film ever to receive the Best Film Award at the Goyas (Spain\\'s national film awards), without a single word of Spanish spoken in it. The Others was nominated for six Saturn Awards including Best Director and Best Writing for Amenábar and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Alakina Mann, and won three: Best Horror Film, Best Actress for Kidman and Best Supporting Actress for Fionnula Flanagan. Kidman was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Drama and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, with Amenábar being nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, a rare occurrence for a horror film.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 1945, Grace Stewart awakens one day from a nightmare in the immediate aftermath of World War II. She lives in a remote country house in Jersey with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a rare disease characterized by photosensitivity (possibly  xeroderma pigmentosum). Grace hires three new servants— housekeeper Mrs. Bertha Mills, gardener Edmund Tuttle, and a mute girl named Lydia. Mrs. Mills explains to Grace that she worked in the same house many years before. When odd events occur at the house, Grace begins to fear there are unknown \"others\" present. Anne claims to have seen a group of people in the house several times: a man, a woman, an old woman and a child called Victor, who claimed that \"the house is theirs\". After Grace hears footsteps and unknown voices, she orders the house to be searched. She then finds a 19th-century photo album of mourning portrait photographs. When Grace asks Mrs. Mills about her previous experience in the house, Mrs. Mills recounts that many left due to an outbreak of tuberculosis.\\nAt night, Grace witnesses a piano playing itself and becomes convinced that the house is haunted. She runs outside in search of the local priest to bless the house. Before leaving, Grace instructs Tuttle to check a small nearby cemetery to see if a family has been buried there with a little boy named Victor. Tuttle finds the cemetery but covers the gravestones with leaves at the order of Mrs. Mills who assures him that Grace will learn the reasons behind the unexplained events in due time. Outside, Grace runs into her husband Charles, who she thought had been killed in the war. Charles greets his children after a long absence, but is distant during his short stay at the house. Later, Grace checks up on her daughter, Anne, whom she has left to play in a spare room.  Instead, to her horror Grace finds an old woman on the floor in the room wearing her daughter\\'s communion dress, veil down.  The old woman claims in Anne\\'s voice \"I am your daughter\".  Frightened, Grace attacks the old woman only to find that the old woman is merely an illusion and Grace has inadvertently attacked her own daughter. Later, Anne tells her brother that their mother has gone mad in the same way she did \"that day\" but he does not recall.  Charles says he must leave for the front, even though Grace claims that the war is over. The two embrace and lie motionless together in bed.\\nThe next morning, Charles has left and the children are screaming that the curtains are gone, thus letting in the sunlight. Grace accuses the servants of having removed the curtains against her wishes and expels them from the house. That night, the children sneak outside and discover that the headstones in the cemetery belong to the recently banished servants. The children run away in fear when they turn to see that the servants are approaching them toward the cemetery in the foggy dark of night. Meanwhile, Grace finds a photograph that has slipped out of the Book of the Dead and fallen onto the floor under some furniture. The photograph displays the corpses of the three servants, Mrs. Mills, Tuttle and Lydia, who perished during a tuberculosis outbreak in 1891. The children run upstairs and hide in the bedroom where they are discovered by \"the other\" elderly woman. Mrs. Mills returns to the house and tells Grace to go upstairs and talk to the intruders.\\nGrace discovers that the old woman is in fact a medium in a séance with Victor\\'s parents, who has found out via automatic writing that Grace smothered her children to death with a pillow in a fit of despair before committing suicide. Grace realizes that \"the others\" are the family that has moved into the house, and that she, her children, and the servants are, in fact, dead.\\nFollowing this display of supernatural and spiritual activity, Victor and his family vacate the house and leave it in the occupancy of the ghosts of its predecessors. However, because they are dead, Anne and Nicholas\\' ghosts are finally allowed to play in the sun. Mrs. Mills informs the Stewarts that others will come back to the house and they will have to learn to coexist together, but Grace ominously states that the house is theirs. As she says this, more \"For Sale\" signs are posted outside.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nThe production crew visited Penshurst Place in Kent to film at the Lime Walk in the gardens. The Lime Walk was used in the scene where Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) went looking for a priest in the thick fog and instead met her husband who had returned from the war. Filming locations are, among other spots, Palacio de los Hornillos in Las Fraguas, Cantabria, Northern Spain, and in Madrid.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nThe Others was released August 10, 2001 in 1,678 theaters in the United States and Canada and grossed $14 million its opening weekend, ranking fourth at the box office. It stayed in fourth for three more weeks, expanding to more theaters. During the weekend of September 21–23, it was second at the box office, grossing $5 million in 2,801 theaters. The film, which cost $17 million to produce, eventually grossed $96.5 million in the United States and Canada and $113.4 million in other countries, for a worldwide total gross of $209.9 million.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nMany critics praised the performances of the stars especially Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 83% approval rating based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"The Others is a spooky thriller that reminds us that a movie doesn\\'t need expensive special effects to be creepy\". On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 74 out of 100, based on 29 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, praising that \"...Alejandro Amenábar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric\". However, he noted that \"in drawing out his effects, Amenábar is a little too confident that style can substitute for substance\".Although the film deals primarily with the spiritual interaction of ghosts with each other rather than with living humans, William Skidelsky of The Observer has suggested that it was inspired by the 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw written by Henry James.\\n\\nAccolades\\nGoya Awards:\\nBest Cinematography (Javier Aguirresarobe)\\nBest Director (Alejandro Amenábar)\\nBest Editing (Nacho Ruiz Capillas)\\nBest Film\\nBest Production Design\\nBest Production Supervision\\nBest Original Screenplay (Alejandro Amenábar)\\nBest Sound\\nKansas City Film Critics Circle Awards:\\nBest Actress (Nicole Kidman)\\nLondon Film Critics:\\nBest Actress of the Year (Nicole Kidman)\\nOnline Film Critics:\\nBest Actress (Nicole Kidman)\\nBest Original Screenplay (Alejandro Amenábar)\\nSaturn Awards:\\nBest Actress (Nicole Kidman)\\nBest Supporting Actress (Fionnula Flanagan)\\nBest Horror Film\\n\\nPlanned remake\\nIn April 2020, Sentient Entertainment had acquired the remake rights to the film.

              " 'The Outsiders (film)': 'The Outsiders is a 1983 American coming-of-age drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The film is an adaptation of the 1967 novel of the same name by S. E. Hinton and was released on March 25, 1983 in the United States. Jo Ellen Misakian, a librarian at Lone Star Elementary School in Fresno, California, and her students were responsible for inspiring Coppola to make the film.The film is noted for its cast of up-and-coming stars, including C. Thomas Howell (who garnered a Young Artist Award), Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, and Diane Lane. The film helped spark the Brat Pack genre of the 1980s. Both Lane and Dillon went on to appear in Coppola\\'s related film Rumble Fish; Dillon and Estevez also starred in Tex (1982). Estevez went on to write and star in That Was Then... This Is Now (1985), the only Hinton film adaptation not to star Dillon.The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, most notably for the performances, with Macchio being singled out for praise. The film performed well at the box office, grossing $33.7 million on a $10 million budget.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn the mid-1960s in Tulsa, Oklahoma, greasers are a gang of tough, low-income working-class teens. They include Ponyboy Curtis and his two older brothers, Darrel \"Darry\" Curtis and Sodapop \"Soda\" Curtis, as well as Johnny Cade, Dallas \"Dally\" Winston, Keith \"Two-Bit\" Matthews, and Steve Randle. Their rivals are the Socs (pronounced \"SO-shiz\" /ˈsoʊʃɪz/, short for Socials), a gang of wealthier kids from the other side of town. \\nOne night, Ponyboy, Johnny, and Dally go to a drive-in theater, where Dally hits on Sherri \"Cherry\" Valance who rebuffs his advances. She and her friend Marcia start making small talk with Ponyboy, who goes to the same school, and invites him and Johnny to sit with them. Afterwards, two Socs, Bob Sheldon and Randy Anderson, confront the Greasers for talking to their girlfriends. The girls defuse the situation by going home with the Socs. \\nLater that night, Ponyboy and Johnny talk and eventually fall asleep in an empty lot. When Ponyboy arrives home late, Darrel loses his temper and hits him, causing Ponyboy to run away. Ponyboy and Johnny take a walk through the park to calm down, but are once again confronted by Bob, Randy, and three other Socs, all drunk. After exchanging hostile words, the Socs give chase and attack the two boys. They begin dunking Ponyboy in a fountain attempting to drown him, but Johnny pulls out his switchblade and fatally stabs Bob, which causes Randy and the others to run off.\\nOn the advice of Dally, and knowing that murder in Oklahoma is punishable by death, Ponyboy and Johnny flee on a cargo train, and hide out in an abandoned church in Windrixville. To change their appearances, both boys cut their hair while Ponyboy bleaches his with peroxide. To pass time, the boys play poker and Ponyboy reads Gone with the Wind and quotes the Robert Frost poem \"Nothing Gold Can Stay\". After a few days, Dally arrives with news that Cherry has offered to support the boys in court, that he told the police that Johnny and Pony were in Texas, and gives Pony a note from Sodapop, saying that Darrel is sorry and asking them to come home. They go out to get something to eat, then return to get their stuff from the church, only to discover that the building is on fire with children trapped inside. The Greasers rescue the kids from the burning church, but Johnny and Dally are injured in the process. Dally heals quickly, but Johnny suffers a broken back and severe burns. The boys are praised for their heroism, but Johnny is charged with manslaughter for killing Bob, while Ponyboy may be sent to a boys\\' home.\\nBob\\'s death sparks calls from the Socs for a \"rumble\". On the day of the rumble, Randy talks to Ponyboy in his car and explains he has no interest in participating in the rumble, and admits that he never expected such heroism from a Greaser as to save a bunch of children from a burning church. Later on, Ponyboy and Two-Bit visit Dally in his hospital room and Dally cuts himself in anger, saying they have to win the rumble for Johnny. \\nLater that night, the Greasers meet up with Tim Shepard\\'s gang and arrive at the rumble site. The Greasers and Socs exchange a few words, and then Dally arrives just before the rumble begins, which the Greasers ultimately win. After the rumble, Dally drives an injured Ponyboy to the hospital to visit Johnny. When he is stopped for speeding by a police officer, Dally tells him that Ponyboy \"fell off his motorcycle\", and the officer provides them with an escort. They enter Johnny\\'s hospital room to tell him about the Greasers\\' victory in the rumble, but Johnny is unimpressed and dies after telling Ponyboy to \"stay gold\", referring to the Frost poem. \\nUnable to bear Johnny\\'s death, Dally wanders through the hospital, pretending to shoot a doctor with his empty gun. He then robs a grocery store, but he is shot and wounded by the owner as he flees. Pursued by the police, Dally is eventually surrounded in a park and then commits suicide by cop by pointing his empty gun at the officers, causing them to shoot him dead.\\nPonyboy is eventually cleared of wrongdoing in Bob\\'s death and allowed to stay with his brothers. Turning the pages of Johnny\\'s copy of Gone with the Wind, Ponyboy finds a letter from Johnny saying that saving the children was worth sacrificing his own life. The story ends with Ponyboy writing a school report about his recent experiences.\\n\\nComplete Novel Edition\\nIn 2005, director Francis Ford Coppola released a DVD that added 22 minutes of previously-deleted footage in response to many letters received over the years from fans of the novel who felt that the deleted scenes were integral parts of the story, as well as comments made by his granddaughter after she read the book in class.\\n\\nCast\\nC. Thomas Howell as Ponyboy Curtis\\nMatt Dillon as Dallas \"Dally\" Winston\\nRalph Macchio as Johnny Cade\\nPatrick Swayze as Darrel \"Darry\" Curtis\\nRob Lowe as Sodapop Curtis\\nEmilio Estevez as Keith \"Two-Bit\" Matthews\\nTom Cruise as Steve Randle\\nGlenn Withrow as Tim Shepard\\nDiane Lane as Sherri \"Cherry\" Valance\\nLeif Garrett as Robert \"Bob\" Sheldon\\nDarren Dalton as Randy Anderson\\nMichelle Meyrink as Marcia\\nTom Waits as Buck Merrill\\nWilliam Smith as Store ClerkAdditionally, Nicolas Cage, Flea and Melanie Griffith have uncredited cameos as background Socs. Heather Langenkamp, prior to her breakout role as Nancy Thompson in A Nightmare on Elm Street, was cast to play Evie, Steve\\'s girlfriend, but her scenes were cut from the final film. Television writer and showrunner Trey Callaway also has an uncredited speaking role as \"Soc in Concession Stand.\"\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nFrancis Ford Coppola had not intended to make a film about teen angst until Jo Ellen Misakian, a school librarian from Lone Star Elementary School in Fresno, California, wrote to him on behalf of her seventh and eighth grade students about adapting The Outsiders.\\n\\nCasting\\nThe casting process led to the debut or star-making performances of actors who would be collectively referred to throughout the 80s as the Brat Pack: C. Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise. Mickey Rourke, Scott Baio, Dennis Quaid also auditioned for roles but were not cast. Producer Fred Roos, a frequent collaborator with Coppola, was partially responsible for the film\\'s casting. In particular, he scouted Patrick Swayze based on his performance in the roller skating movie Skatetown, U.S.A. (1979).Ralph Macchio stated that during auditions, Coppola \"wanted everybody to read for a different role.\" He said that Coppola had all of the actors \"in one room watching each other audition...It’s brutal because you’re becoming self-conscious of any choices because you’re watching reactions based on other actors and watching the filmmakers and how they respond because you’re all trying to get the job. For Francis, it was about mixing and matching the ensemble, saying \\'Dennis Quaid, you read this, and Rob Lowe, you read that.\\'\" As a New Yorker who didn\\'t know any of the other actors auditioning, Macchio also stated that he felt like an outsider during the process.\\n\\nFilming\\nThe film was shot on location in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Filming took place from March 29 to May 15, 1982. A newspaper, used to show a story about the three greasers saving the kids in The Outsiders, includes a real story from 1982 regarding the death of a man hit by a train in Boston. Coppola\\'s craving for realism almost led to disaster during the church-burning scene. He pressed for \"more fire\", and the small, controlled blaze accidentally triggered a much larger, uncontrolled fire, which a downpour doused.A total of two hours and 13 minutes of footage were shot before editing, where it was brought down to 91 minutes on the theatrical cut, and 114 minutes on \\'The Complete Novel\\' re-release.\\nThe pranks that went on during the filming have become legendary, mostly initiated by Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, and Patrick Swayze.  The targets were often C. Thomas Howell and Diane Lane. Ralph Macchio was not involved because he was so focused on getting his role right. The author of the original novel, S.E. Hinton, was involved during the filming as she and Coppola wrote the screenplay together (and appeared as the nurse at the end of the film). She also later stated that she served as an informal \"den mother\" to many of the actors, as she was \"close to all of them.\"\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has a rating of 63% based on 40 reviews, with an average score of 6.06/10. The site\\'s consensus reads, \"The cracks continue to show in Coppola\\'s directorial style, but The Outsiders remains a blustery, weird, and fun adaptation of the classic novel.\" Roger Ebert awarded the film two and a half out of four stars, citing problems with Coppola\\'s vision, \"the characters wind up like pictures, framed and hanging on the screen.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 41, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".The film\\'s casting directors Janet Hirshenson and Jane Jenkins, wrote in a 2007 book that the film\\'s realistic portrayal of poor teenagers \"created a new kind of filmmaking, especially about teenagers — a more naturalistic look at how young people talk, act, and experience the world. This movie was one of the few Hollywood offerings to deal realistically with kids from the wrong side of the tracks, and to portray honestly children whose parents had abused, neglected, or otherwise failed them.\"Stéphane Delorme, in his book on Coppola, wrote : \"The Outsiders is a wonder. And wonder is also the subject of the film. \\'Stay Gold\\', says the song over the title credits. (...) The artificiality of the rural setting, which is as fake as in The Night of the Hunter, places us in the distant, mythical past. It takes only dye to turn these blond heads into golden heads, and thus to go from nostalgia for one\\'s youth in the 1960s to a general regret for a golden age.\"\\n\\nAccolades\\nThe Outsiders was nominated for four Young Artist Awards, given annually since 1978 by the Young Artist Foundation. C. Thomas Howell won for \"Best Young Motion Picture Actor in a Feature Film\". Diane Lane was nominated for \"Best Young Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture\". The film was nominated for \"Best Family Feature Motion Picture\". Francis Ford Coppola was nominated for the Golden Prize at the 13th Moscow International Film Festival.\\n\\n\"The Complete Novel\" re-release\\nIn September 2005, Coppola re-released the film on DVD, including 22 minutes of additional footage and new music, as a 2-disc set called The Outsiders: The Complete Novel. Coppola re-inserted some deleted scenes to make the film more faithful to the book. At the beginning of the film, he added scenes where Ponyboy gets stalked and jumped, the gang talks about going to the movies, Sodapop and Ponyboy talking in their room and Dally, Pony and Johnny bum around before going to the movies. In the end, Coppola added the scenes taking place in court, Mr. Syme talking to Ponyboy, and Sodapop, Ponyboy and Darry in the park. Also, much of the original score was replaced with music popular in the 1960s as well as new music composed by Michael Seifert and Dave Padrutt. The film was re-rated by the MPAA as PG-13 for \"violence, teen drinking and smoking, and some sexual references\".Disc 2 of the DVD includes some special features, featuring behind-the-scenes interviews with the cast & crew, readings from the novel, additional deleted scenes, the original theatrical trailer, and an NBC News Today segment from 1983 talking about how The Outsiders has inspired teenagers across the world.\\nThe director also removed three scenes that were in the theatrical version to improve pacing. Those scenes being: Ponyboy and Johnny looking at their reflections in the lake and talking about their hair, attempting to catch a rabbit, and playing poker. They can be found on the second disc as additional scenes along with other deleted scenes that were filmed but not put into the movie. In addition, Swayze, Macchio, Lane, and Howell gathered at Coppola\\'s estate to watch the re-release, and their commentary is included on the DVD. Dillon and Lowe provided separate commentary.\\nA Blu-ray edition of The Outsiders: The Complete Novel was released in Region A on June 3, 2014.\\n\\nSequel TV series\\nA television series based on the characters of the novel and film aired in 1990. It consists of a different cast playing the same characters. It picks up right after the events of the film\\'s ending and lasted only one season.\\n\\nSee also\\nThe Outsiders novel\\nThe Outsiders TV series\\nThe Outsiders House Museum\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nThe Outsiders at IMDb\\nThe Outsiders at AllMovie\\nThe Outsiders at Box Office Mojo\\nThe Outsiders at Rotten Tomatoes\\nRevisiting \\'The Outsiders\\' After The Immediacy Of Adolescence\\'s Plights Have Passed - July 31, 2018, WBUR-FM',\n",

The paper\\'s circulation dropped after the war, then rose by the end of the 19th century. Originally supportive of the Democratic Party, The Inquirer\\'s political affiliation eventually shifted toward the Whig Party and then the Republican Party before officially becoming politically independent in the middle of the 20th century. By the end of the 1960s, The Inquirer trailed its chief competitor, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, and lacked modern facilities and experienced staff. In the 1970s, new owners and editors turned the newspaper into one of the country\\'s most prominent.\\nThe publisher and CEO is Elizabeth H. Hughes, and the editor is Gabriel Escobar.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer was founded as The Pennsylvania Inquirer by printer John R. Walker and John Norvell, former editor of Philadelphia\\'s largest newspaper, the Aurora & Gazette. An editorial in the first issue of The Pennsylvania Inquirer promised that the paper would be devoted to the right of a minority to voice their opinion and \"the maintenance of the rights and liberties of the people, equally against the abuses as the usurpation of power.\" They pledged support to then-President Andrew Jackson and \"home industries, American manufactures, and internal improvements that so materially contribute to the agricultural, commercial and national prosperity.\" Founded on June 1, 1829, The Philadelphia Inquirer is the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the United States. However, in 1962, an Inquirer-commissioned historian traced The Inquirer to John Dunlap\\'s The Pennsylvania Packet, which was founded on October 28, 1771. In 1850, The Packet was merged with another newspaper, The North American, which later merged with the Philadelphia Public Ledger. Finally, the Public Ledger merged with The Philadelphia Inquirer in the 1930s, and between 1962 and 1975, a line on The Inquirer\\'s front page claimed that the newspaper is the United States\\' oldest surviving daily newspaper.Six months after The Inquirer was founded, with competition from eight established daily newspapers, lack of funds forced Norvell and Walker to sell the newspaper to publisher and United States Gazette associate editor Jesper Harding. After Harding acquired The Pennsylvania Inquirer, it was briefly published as an afternoon paper before returning to its original morning format in January 1830. Under Harding, in 1829, The Inquirer moved from its original location between Front and Second Streets to between Second and Third Streets. When Harding bought and merged the Morning Journal in January 1830, the newspaper was moved to South Second Street. Ten years later The Inquirer again was moved, this time to its own building at the corner of Third Street and Carter\\'s Alley. Harding expanded The Inquirer\\'s content and the paper soon grew into a major Philadelphian newspaper. The expanded content included the addition of fiction, and in 1840, Harding gained rights to publish several Charles Dickens novels for which Dickens was paid a significant amount. At the time the common practice was to pay little or nothing for the rights of foreign authors\\' works.\\n\\nCivil War to 1920s\\nHarding retired in 1859 and was succeeded by his son William White Harding, who had become a partner three years earlier. William Harding changed the name of the newspaper to its current name, The Philadelphia Inquirer. Harding, in an attempt to increase circulation, cut the price of the paper, began delivery routes and had newsboys sell papers on the street. In 1859, circulation had been around 7,000; by 1863 it had increased to 70,000. Part of the increase was due to the interest in news during the American Civil War. Twenty-five to thirty thousand copies of The Inquirer were often distributed to Union soldiers during the war and several times the U.S. government asked The Philadelphia Inquirer to issue a special edition specifically for soldiers. The Philadelphia Inquirer supported the Union, but Harding wanted their coverage to remain neutral. Confederate generals often sought copies of the paper, believing that the newspaper\\'s war coverage was accurate.Inquirer journalist Uriah Hunt Painter was at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861, a battle which ended in a Confederate victory. Initial reports from the government claimed a Union victory, but The Inquirer went with Painter\\'s firsthand account. Crowds threatened to burn The Inquirer\\'s building down because of the report. Another report, this time about General George Meade, angered Meade enough that he punished Edward Crapsey, the reporter who wrote it. Crapsey and other war correspondents later decided to attribute any victories of the Army of the Potomac, Meade\\'s command, to Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the entire Union army. Any defeats of the Army of the Potomac would be attributed to Meade.During the war, The Inquirer continued to grow with more staff being added and another move into a larger building on Chestnut Street. However, after the war, economic hits combined with Harding becoming ill, hurt The Inquirer. Despite Philadelphia\\'s population growth, distribution fell from 70,000 during the Civil War to 5,000 in 1888. Beginning in 1889, the paper was sold to publisher James Elverson. To bring back the paper, Elverson moved The Inquirer to a new building with the latest printing technology and an increased staff. The \"new\" Philadelphia Inquirer premiered on March 1 and was successful enough that Elverson started a Sunday edition of the paper. In 1890, in an attempt to increase circulation further, the price of The Inquirer was cut and the paper\\'s size was increased, mostly with classified advertisements. After five years The Inquirer had to move into a larger building on Market Street and later expanded into adjacent property.After Elverson\\'s death in 1911, his son by his wife Sallie Duvall, James Elverson Jr. took charge. Under Elverson Jr., the newspaper continued to grow, eventually needing to move again. Elverson Jr. bought land at Broad and Callowhill Streets and built the eighteen-story Elverson Building, now known as the Inquirer Building. The first Inquirer issue printed at the building came out on July 13, 1925. Elverson Jr. died a few years later in 1929 and his sister, Eleanor Elverson, Mrs. Jules Patenôtre, took over.\\n\\nAnnenberg years\\nEleanor Elverson Patenôtre ordered cuts throughout the paper, but was not really interested in managing it and ownership was soon put up for sale. Cyrus Curtis and Curtis-Martin Newspapers Inc. bought the newspaper on March 5, 1930. Curtis died a year later and his stepson-in-law, John Charles Martin, took charge. Martin merged The Inquirer with another paper, the Public Ledger, but the Great Depression hurt Curtis-Martin Newspapers and the company defaulted in payments of maturity notes. Subsequently, ownership of The Inquirer returned to the Patenôtre family and Elverson Corp. Charles A. Taylor was elected president of The Inquirer Co. and ran the paper until it was sold to Moses L. Annenberg in 1936. During the period between Elverson Jr. and Annenberg The Inquirer stagnated, its editors ignoring most of the poor economic news of the Depression. The lack of growth allowed J. David Stern\\'s newspaper, The Philadelphia Record, to surpass The Inquirer in circulation and become the largest newspaper in Pennsylvania.Under Moses Annenberg, The Inquirer turned around. Annenberg added new features, increased staff and held promotions to increase circulation. By November 1938 Inquirer\\'s weekday circulation increased to 345,422 from 280,093 in 1936. During that same period the Record\\'s circulation had dropped to 204,000 from 328,322. In 1939, Annenberg was charged with income tax evasion. Annenberg pleaded guilty before his trial and was sent to prison where he died in 1942. Upon Moses Annenberg\\'s death, his son, Walter Annenberg, took over. Not long after, in 1947, the Record went out of business and The Philadelphia Inquirer became Philadelphia\\'s only major daily morning newspaper. While still trailing behind Philadelphia\\'s largest newspaper, the Evening Bulletin, The Inquirer continued to be profitable. In 1948, Walter Annenberg expanded the Inquirer Building with a new structure that housed new printing presses for The Inquirer and, during the 1950s and 1960s, Annenberg\\'s other properties, Seventeen  and TV Guide. In 1957 Annenberg bought the Philadelphia Daily News and combined the Daily News\\' facilities with The Inquirer\\'s.\\nA 38-day strike in 1958 hurt The Inquirer and, after the strike ended, so many reporters had accepted buyout offers and left that the newsroom was noticeably empty. Furthermore, many current reporters had been copyclerks just before the strike and had little experience. One of the few star reporters of the 1950s and 1960s was investigative reporter Harry Karafin. During his career Harry Karafin exposed corruption and other exclusive stories for The Inquirer, but also extorted money out of individuals and organizations. Karafin would claim he had harmful information and would demand money in exchange for the information not being made public. This went on from the late 1950s into the early 1960s before Karafin was exposed in 1967 and convicted of extortion a year later. By the end of the 1960s, circulation and advertising revenue was in decline and the newspaper had become, according to Time magazine, \"uncreative and undistinguished.\"\\n\\nCorporate ownership\\nIn 1969, Annenberg was offered US$55 million for The Inquirer by Samuel Newhouse, but having earlier promised John S. Knight the right of first refusal of any sale offer, Annenberg sold it to Knight instead. The Inquirer, along with the Philadelphia Daily News, became part of Knight Newspapers and its new subsidiary, Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. (PNI). Five years later, Knight Newspapers merged with Ridder Publications to form Knight Ridder.When The Inquirer was bought, it was understaffed, its equipment was outdated, many of its employees were underskilled and the paper trailed its chief competitor, the Evening Bulletin, in weekday circulation. However, Eugene L. Roberts Jr., who became The Inquirer\\'s executive editor in 1972, turned the newspaper around.  Between 1975 and 1990 The Inquirer won seventeen Pulitzers, six consecutively between 1975 and 1980, and more journalism awards than any other newspaper in the United States. Time magazine chose The Inquirer as one of the ten best daily newspapers in the United States, calling Roberts\\' changes to the paper, \"one of the most remarkable turnarounds, in quality and profitability, in the history of American journalism.\" By July 1980 The Inquirer had become the most circulated paper in Philadelphia, forcing the Evening Bulletin to shut down two years later. The Inquirer\\'s success was not without hardships. Between 1970 and 1985 the newspaper experienced eleven strikes, the longest lasting forty-six days in 1985. The Inquirer was also criticized for covering \"Karachi better than Kensington\". This did not stop the paper\\'s growth during the 1980s, and when the Evening Bulletin shut down, The Inquirer hired seventeen Bulletin reporters and doubled its bureaus to attract former Bulletin readers. By 1989, Philadelphia Newspapers Inc.\\'s editorial staff reached a peak of 721 employees.The 1990s saw gradually dropping circulation and advertisement revenue for The Inquirer. The decline was part of a nationwide trend, but the effects were exacerbated by, according to dissatisfied Inquirer employees, the paper\\'s resisting changes that many other daily newspapers implemented to keep readers and pressure from Knight Ridder to cut costs. During most of Roberts\\'s time as editor, Knight Ridder allowed him a great deal of freedom in running the newspaper. However, in the late 1980s, Knight Ridder had become concerned about The Inquirer\\'s profitability and took a more active role in its operations. Knight Ridder pressured The Inquirer to expand into the more profitable suburbs, while at the same time cutting staff and coverage of national and international stories. Staff cuts continued until Knight Ridder was bought in 2006, with some of The Inquirer\\'s best reporters accepting buyouts and leaving for other newspapers such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. By the late 1990s, all of the high-level editors who had worked with Eugene Roberts in the 1970s and 1980s had left, none at normal retirement age. Since the 1980s, the paper has won only three Pulitzers: a 1997 award for \"Explanatory Journalism.\", the public service award (the top category) in 2012 for \" its exploration of pervasive violence in the city\\'s schools\", and the 2014 prize for criticism, won by architecture critic Inga Saffron. In 1998, Inquirer reporter Ralph Cipriano filed a libel suit against Knight Ridder, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and Inquirer editor Robert Rosenthal over comments Rosenthal made about Cipriano to The Washington Post. Cipriano had claimed that it was difficult reporting negative stories in The Inquirer about the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia and Rosenthal later claimed that Cipriano had \"a very strong personal point of view and an agenda ... He could never prove [his stories].\" The suit was later settled out of court in 2001.The paper launched an online news desk in the early 2000s in order to compete with local radio stations for breaking news. Knight Ridder was bought by rival The McClatchy Company in June 2006. The Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News were among the twelve less-profitable Knight Ridder newspapers that McClatchy put up for sale when the deal was announced in March. On June 29, 2006, The Inquirer and Daily News were sold to Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC (PMH), a group of Philadelphian area business people, including Brian P. Tierney, PMH\\'s chief executive. The new owners planned to spend US$5 million on advertisements and promotions to increase The Inquirer\\'s profile and readership.In the years following Philadelphia Media Holdings\\' acquisition, The Inquirer saw larger than expected revenue losses, mostly from national advertising, and continued loss of circulation. The revenue losses caused management to cut four hundred jobs at The Inquirer and Daily News in the three years since the papers were bought. Despite efforts to cut costs, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on February 21, 2009. Philadelphia Media Holdings was about US$390 million in debt, due to money borrowed to buy The Inquirer and Daily News. The bankruptcy was the beginning of a year-long dispute between Philadelphia Media Holdings and its creditors. The group of creditors, which included banks and hedge funds, wanted to take control of Philadelphia Newspapers LLC themselves and opposed efforts by Philadelphia Media Holdings to keep control. Philadelphia Media Holdings received support from most of the paper\\'s unions and launched a public-relations campaign to promote local ownership. A bankruptcy auction was held on April 28, 2010. The group of lending creditors and a group of local investors allied with Brian Tierney both bid for Philadelphia Newspapers, but the lenders had the winning bid. The deal fell through after the group of lenders, under the name of Philadelphia Media Network (PMN), was unable to reach a contract agreement with the union representing the company\\'s drivers. Philadelphia Newspapers, represented by Lawrence G. McMichael of Dilworth Paxson LLP, challenged the right of creditors to credit bid at a bankruptcy auction.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that credit bidding was not permitted.\\nThe papers went up for auction again in September and again Philadelphia Media Network (PMN) won the bid. After successfully negotiating a contract with all of the paper\\'s fourteen unions, the US$139 million deal became official on October 8.The Philadelphia Inquirer continued to struggle to make a profit, due to competition from digital media sources. By May 2012 the combined journalist staff at all of Philadelphia Media Network was about 320 and some of the same stories and photographs appear both in The Inquirer and Daily News. On April 2, 2012, a group of local business leaders paid $55 million for the paper, less than 15 percent of the $515 million spent to buy the papers in 2006.In June 2014, PMN was sold to H.F. \"Gerry\" Lenfest, who appointed C.Z. \"Terry\" Egger as publisher and CEO in October 2015. In 2016, Lenfest donated PMN to The Philadelphia Foundation, so that The Inquirer, its sister newspaper, the Daily News, and their joint website, Philly.com, could remain in Philadelphia.\\n\\nMove to Strawbridge\\'s building\\nPhiladelphia Media Network sold the Inquirer Building in October 2011 to developer Bart Blatstein, of Tower Investments Inc., who intends to turn the complex into a mixed-use complex of offices retail and apartments. The next month, publisher and CEO Gregory J. Osberg announced that 600 of the 740 Philadelphia Media Network employees of The Inquirer, Daily News, and Philly.com would move to office space in the former Strawbridge & Clothier department store on east Market Street. The remaining employees would move to offices in the suburbs. The Philadelphia Media Network moved to the new location in July 2012, consolidating the offices entirely on the third floor. Cutbacks had left much of the 525,000 square feet (49,000 m2) within the Inquirer Building empty, but the 125,000-square-foot (12,000 m2) east Market Street location consolidated Philadelphia Media\\'s departments, including the Daily News\\' newsroom with The Inquirer\\'s. The new location would include a street-level lobby and event room. Plans for the building also included electronic signage such as a news ticker on the corner of the high-rise.In 2019, Philadelphia Media Network was renamed from Philly.com to Inquirer.com and made the Daily News an edition of The Inquirer. Philadelphia Media Network was renamed The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC.\\n\\n2020 \"Buildings Matter, Too\" article\\nOn Tuesday, June 2, 2020 The Inquirer ran an Inga Saffron article covering the George Floyd protests under the headline \"Buildings Matter, Too\", a reference to the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement. On June 3, the editors apologized for the headline and journalists at The Inquirer wrote an open letter detailing the paper\\'s failures to accurately report on non-white communities. The letter demanded a plan for correcting these issues and stated these journalists would be calling in \"sick and tired\" on June 4. The letter read read in part:\\nWe’re tired of shouldering the burden of dragging this 200-year-old institution kicking and screaming into a more equitable age. We’re tired of being told of the progress the company has made and being served platitudes about “diversity and inclusion” when we raise our concerns. We’re tired of seeing our words and photos twisted to fit a narrative that does not reflect our reality. We’re tired of being told to show both sides of issues there are no two sides of.\\nMore than 40 Inquirer staffers called in sick on June 4. On June 6, the paper announced that Stan Wischnowski would resign as senior vice president and executive editor. Journalists were told they would not have a say in his replacement.\\n\\nPolitics\\nJohn Norvell left the Aurora & Gazette and his job as editor because he disagreed with what he felt was the newspaper\\'s editorial approval of a movement towards a European class system. When Norvell and John Walker founded The Inquirer they wanted the newspaper to represent all people and not just the higher classes. The newly launched newspaper supported Jeffersonian democracy and President Andrew Jackson, and it declared support for the right of the minority\\'s opinion to be heard. A legend about the founding of The Inquirer states that Norvell  said, \"There could be no better name than The Inquirer. In a free state, there should always be an inquirer asking on behalf of the people: \\'Why was this done? Why is that necessary work not done? Why is that man put forward? Why is that law proposed? Why? Why? Why?\\'\"When Norvell and Walker sold their newspaper to Jesper Harding, Harding kept the paper close to the founder\\'s politics and backed the Democratic Party. However, disagreeing with Andrew Jackson\\'s handling of the Second Bank of the United States he began supporting the anti-Jackson wing of the Democrats. During the 1836 Presidential election Harding supported the Whig party candidate over the Democratic candidate and afterwards The Inquirer became known for its support of Whig candidates. Before the American Civil War began, The Inquirer supported the preservation of the Union, and was critical of the antislavery movement which many felt was responsible for the Southern succession crisis. Once the war began The Inquirer maintained an independent reporting of the war\\'s events. However The Inquirer firmly supported the Union side. At first The Inquirer\\'s editors were against emancipation of the slaves, but after setbacks by the Union army The Inquirer started advocating a more pro-war and pro-Republican stance. In a July 1862 article, The Inquirer wrote \"in this war there can be but two parties, patriots and traitors.\"\\n\\nRepublican Bible\\nUnder James Elverson, The Philadelphia Inquirer declared, \"the new Inquirer shall be in all respects a complete, enterprising, progressive newspaper, moved by all the wide-awake spirit of the time and behind in nothing of interest to people who want to know what is going on every day and everywhere...steadily and vigorously Republican in its political policy, but just and fair in its treatment of all questions...\" During the 1900 Republican convention in Philadelphia, Elverson set up a large electric banner over Broad Street that declared \"Philadelphia Inquirer – Largest Republican Circulation in the World.\" At the turn of the 20th century the newspaper began editorial campaigns to improve Philadelphia, including the paving of major streets and stopping a corrupt plan to buy the polluted Schuylkill Canal for drinking water. The newspaper continued similar politics under Elverson Jr., and by the 1920s The Inquirer became known as the \"Republican Bible of Pennsylvania\".Between 1929 and 1936, while under Patenotre and Curtis-Martin, The Inquirer continued to support the Republican party and President Herbert Hoover, noticeably by not reporting on the news of the Great Depression. Statistics on unemployment or business closings were ignored, even when they came from the government. Information about Philadelphia banks closing was relegated to the back of the financial section. When Moses Annenberg took over The Philadelphia Inquirer, he announced that the paper would \"continue to uphold the principles of the Republican Party\", but in a meeting with newspaper editors shortly after, he proposed that the paper go independent and support President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the upcoming election. The editors rejected this idea and the paper remained Republican. In the late 1930s, Annenberg disagreed with Roosevelt\\'s New Deal programs and his handling of strikes. This prompted editorials criticizing the policies of Roosevelt and his supporters. He strongly opposed Democratic Pennsylvania governor George Earle and had The Inquirer support the Republican candidates in the 1938 Pennsylvania state elections. When Republicans swept the election there was a celebration at The Inquirer headquarters with red flares and the firing of cannons. The attacks against Democrats and the support given towards Republicans caught the attention of the Roosevelt administration. Annenberg had turned The Philadelphia Inquirer into a major challenger to its chief competitor the Democratic Record, and after Annenberg began focusing on politics, Democratic politicians often attacked Annenberg and accused him of illegal business practices. In 1939, Annenberg was charged with income tax evasion, pleaded guilty before the trial, and was sent to prison for three years. Annenberg\\'s friends and his son, Walter, claimed that the whole trial was politically motivated and his sentence was harsher than it should have been.\\n\\nIndependent\\nWhen the Record shut down in 1947, The Inquirer announced that it was now an independent newspaper and, frustrated with corruption in Philadelphia, supported Democratic candidates in the 1951 election. While Walter Annenberg had made The Inquirer independent, he did use the paper to attack people he disliked. Sometimes when a person or group angered Annenberg, that person would be blacklisted and not mentioned anywhere within The Inquirer. People on the blacklist were even airbrushed out of images. People who were on the list at one point included Nicholas Katzenbach, Ralph Nader, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and the basketball team the Philadelphia Warriors, who were not mentioned for an entire season. In 1966, Walter Annenberg used The Inquirer to attack Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Milton Shapp. During a press conference, an Inquirer reporter asked Shapp if he had ever been a patient in a mental hospital; having never been a patient, Shapp said no. The next day\\'s headline in The Inquirer read \"Shapp Denies Ever having been in a Mental Home.\" Shapp attributed his loss of the election to Annenberg\\'s attack campaign.Annenberg was a backer and friend of Richard Nixon. In the 1952 presidential election, critics later claimed Annenberg had The Inquirer look the other way when covering accusations Nixon was misappropriating funds. Later, to avoid accusations of political bias, Annenberg had The Inquirer use only news agency sources such as the Associated Press for the 1960 and 1968 presidential elections. When Nixon was elected president in 1968, Annenberg was appointed the U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James\\'s. A year later when Annenberg sold the newspaper to Knight Newspapers, a part of the deal stipulated that Annenberg\\'s name would appear as \"Editor and Publisher Emeritus\" in The Inquirer\\'s masthead. In 1970, Annenberg, already unhappy with changes in the newspaper, had his name removed from the paper after an editorial critical of Richard Nixon appeared.Under Knight Ridder, The Inquirer continued to be editorially independent. However, conservative commentators have labeled The Inquirer left leaning, and the paper has not endorsed a Republican candidate for President of the United States since Gerald Ford in 1976. Throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, groups supportive of Israel such as the Zionist Organization of America often accused The Inquirer of being anti-Israel. In 2006, The Inquirer became one of the only major United States newspapers to print one of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons. Afterwards, Muslims picketed outside The Inquirer Building to protest the printing of the cartoons in the paper.\\n\\nWhen Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C. (PMH) bought the paper in 2006, Brian P. Tierney and the business people behind PMH signed a pledge promising that they would not influence the content of the paper. Tierney, a Republican activist who had represented many local groups in the Philadelphia area, had criticized The Inquirer in the past on behalf of his clients. One of Tierney\\'s clients had been the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which he had represented during the Cipriano affair. PMH membership also included Bruce E. Toll, vice chairman of Toll Brothers Inc. Tierney said that the group was aware that the fastest way to ruin its investment in The Inquirer was to threaten the paper\\'s editorial independence. The 2012 sale of Philadelphia Media Network to six local business leaders also led to concern of conflict of interest. The new owners, which included New Jersey Democratic fundraiser George Norcross III, media entrepreneur H. F. Lenfest, former New Jersey Nets owner Lewis Katz, and CEO of Liberty Property Trust and chairman of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce William Hankowsky, pledged not to influence the content of the paper.\\n\\nBoard of Directors\\nThe members of Board of Directors as of February 2021:\\nJosh Kopelman\\nLisa Kabnick\\nStephen J.

Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs, which he credits with helping him overcome dyslexia. In the 2000s, he sparked controversy with his Church-affiliated criticisms of psychiatry and anti-depressant drugs, his efforts to promote Scientology as a religion in Europe, and a leaked video interview of him promoting Scientology.\\n\\nEarly life\\nThomas Cruise Mapother IV was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, to electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934–1984) and special education teacher Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer; 1936–2017). His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and had English, German, and Irish ancestry. Cruise has three sisters named Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. One of his cousins, William Mapother, is also an actor who has appeared alongside Cruise in five films. Cruise grew up in near poverty and had a Catholic upbringing. He later described his father as \"a merchant of chaos\", a \"bully\", and a \"coward\" who beat his children. He elaborated, \"[My father] was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he\\'d lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, \\'There\\'s something wrong with this guy. Don\\'t trust him. Be careful around him.\\'\"Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada. When his father took a job as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces, his family moved in late 1971 to Beacon Hill, Ottawa. He attended the new Robert Hopkins Public School for his fourth and fifth grade education. He first became involved in drama in fourth grade, under the tutelage of George Steinburg. He and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival. Drama organizer Val Wright, who was in the audience, later said that \"the movement and improvisation were excellent [...] it was a classic ensemble piece\". In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa. That year, his mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States. In 1978, she married Jack South. Cruise\\'s father died of cancer in 1984. Cruise briefly took a church scholarship and attended a Franciscan seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio; he aspired to become a priest before he became interested in acting. In total, he attended 15 schools in 14 years. In his senior year of high school, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game. He went on to star in the school\\'s production of Guys and Dolls. In 1980, he graduated from Glen Ridge High School in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.\\n\\nCareer\\nActing\\nAt age 18, with the blessing of his mother and stepfather, Cruise moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. After working as a busboy in New York, he went to Los Angeles to try out for television roles. He signed with CAA and began acting in films. He first appeared in a bit part in the 1981 film Endless Love, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in Taps later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of The Outsiders. That same year he appeared in All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as \"A Generation X classic, and a career maker for Tom Cruise\". He also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film Legend, released in 1985. By 1986\\'s Top Gun, his status as a superstar cemented.\\n\\nCruise followed up Top Gun with The Color of Money, which came out the same year, and which paired him with  Paul Newman. 1988 saw him star in Cocktail, which earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Film and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in 1989\\'s Born on the Fourth of July, which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People\\'s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise\\'s first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.\\nCruise\\'s next films were Days of Thunder (1990) and Far and Away (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest, followed by the legal thriller The Firm, which was a critical and commercial success. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan\\'s Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice\\'s best-selling novel. The film was well-received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film, however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in Daily Variety praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of Mission: Impossible, which he produced. It was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the Jim Phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series.In 1996, he took on the title role in Jerry Maguire, for which he earned a Golden Globe and his second nomination for an Academy Award. In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in the erotic Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut, and took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in Magnolia, for which he received another Golden Globe and nomination for an Academy Award.\\nIn 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the Mission Impossible films, Mission: Impossible 2. The film was helmed by Hong Kong director John Woo and branded with his gun fu style, and continued the series\\' blockbuster success at the box office, taking in almost $547M in worldwide figures. Like its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year, and had a mixed critical reception. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for this film.\\nHis next five films were major critical and commercial successes. The following year Cruise starred in the romantic thriller Vanilla Sky (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction action film Minority Report which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the science fiction short story by Philip K. Dick.\\n\\nIn 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick\\'s period action drama The Last Samurai, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor. In 2004, Cruise received critical acclaim for his performance as Vincent in Collateral, directed by Michael Mann. In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4 million worldwide. Also in 2005, he won the People\\'s Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star and the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100 million at the box office.In 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the Mission Impossible film series, Mission: Impossible III. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed nearly $400 million at the box office. In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in Lions for Lambs, which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as \"Les Grossman\" in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr.  This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller Valkyrie released on December 25, 2008 to box office success.In March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy Knight and Day, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010. On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. The film was released in December 2011 to high critical acclaim and box office success. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise\\'s biggest commercial success to that date.\\n\\nOn May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist. In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie Rock of Ages, in which he played the character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012.Cruise starred as Jack Reacher in the film adaptation of British author Lee Child\\'s 2005 novel One Shot. The film was released on December 21, 2012. It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $217 million worldwide. In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film Oblivion based on director Joseph Kosinski\\'s  graphic novel of the same name. The film met with mixed reviews and grossed $286 million worldwide. It also starred Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko. In 2014, Cruise starred in the science fiction-action film Edge of Tomorrow, which received positive reviews and grossed over $370 million.In 2015, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the Mission: Impossible series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which he also produced. Returning cast members included Simon Pegg as Benji and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, with Christopher McQuarrie as director. The film earned high critical acclaim and was a commercial success.Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff\\'s 1932 horror movie The Mummy. The new film, also titled The Mummy received negative reviews and flopped at the box office. In 2018, Cruise again reprised Ethan Hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, Mission: Impossible – Fallout. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed over $791 million at the box office. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it is Cruise\\'s biggest commercial success to date.\\n\\nProducing\\nCruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993, and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise\\'s films, the first being Mission: Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise\\'s first project as a producer.\\n\\nCruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as \"one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood.\" Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise\\'s tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise\\'s exceptional commercial prowess.Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise\\'s film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on Erik Larson\\'s New York Times bestseller The Devil in the White City about a real-life serial killer, H. H. Holmes, at Chicago\\'s World\\'s Columbian Exposition. Kathryn Bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the World\\'s Fair, in which DiCaprio will star.Cruise has produced several films in which he appeared. He produced Mission: Impossible, Without Limits, Mission: Impossible 2, The Others, Vanilla Sky and many others.\\n\\nBreak with Paramount\\nOn August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In the Wall Street Journal, chairman of Viacom (Paramount\\'s parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise\\'s value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views. Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount\\'s announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms.Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount\\'s discontent over Cruise/Wagner\\'s exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the Mission: Impossible franchise.\\n\\nManagement of United Artists\\nIn November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists. Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA\\'s chief executive.\\nProduction began in 2007 of Valkyrie, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007, Cruise signed to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. Lambs was released on November 9, 2007, opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.\\nIn August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise\\'s share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nRelationships and wealth\\nCruise splits his time between homes in Beverly Hills, California; Telluride, Colorado; Clearwater, Florida; Dulwich, London; and East Grinstead, West Sussex. He had several relationships with women in the early-to-mid-1980s, including Rebecca De Mornay, Patti Scialfa, and Cher.Cruise married actress Mimi Rogers on May 9, 1987. They divorced on February 4, 1990. Rogers introduced Cruise to Scientology.Cruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. They adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. In 2007, Kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to Cruise, saying that it was wrongly reported and explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy.Cruise was next romantically linked with Penélope Cruz, his co-star in Vanilla Sky (2001). Their relationship ended in 2004. An article in the October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair stated that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, Scientologist leaders launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of \"auditions\" of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology. Scientology and Cruise\\'s lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing Vanity Fair of \"shoddy journalism\" and \"religious bigotry\". Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.In April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On April 27 that year, Cruise and Holmes—dubbed TomKat by the media—made their first public appearance together in Rome. A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show, infamously jumping up and down on Winfrey\\'s couch during the show. Media coverage at the time implied that Oprah was somewhat taken aback by Cruise\\'s overexhuberent couch-outburst, which distracted from the intended promotion of Cruise\\'s current film, War of the Worlds. On October 6, 2005, Cruise and Holmes announced they were expecting a child. In April 2006, their daughter Suri was born. On November 18, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, in a Scientologist ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars. Their publicists said the couple had \"officialized\" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony. There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the Church of Scientology. David Miscavige, the head of Scientology, served as Cruise\\'s best man. On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise. On July 9, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers. New York law requires all divorce documents remain sealed, so the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available.\\n\\nSpaceflight mission\\nCruise is sponsored for an upcoming spaceflight mission on the SpaceX AX-1 mission in late 2021, as part of a project to film an upcoming unnamed movie in space on board the International Space Station.\\n\\nScientology\\nCruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs. He became involved with Scientology in 1990 through his first wife, Mimi Rogers. Cruise struggled with dyslexia at an early age and has said that Scientology, specifically the L. Ron Hubbard Study Tech, helped him overcome dyslexia.\\n\\nAdvocacy of Scientology\\nIn addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Paris city council revealed that Cruise had lobbied officials Nicolas Sarkozy and Jean-Claude Gaudin. They described him as a militant spokesman for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him.Cruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City 9/11 rescue workers detoxification therapy based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This drew criticism from the medical profession and from firefighters.For such activities, Scientology leader David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004.\\n\\nCriticism of psychiatry\\nIn January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement \"I think psychiatry should be outlawed.\" Further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an antidepressant to which Shields credits her recovery from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. In response, Shields argued that Cruise \"should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them\". This led to a heated argument between Matt Lauer and Cruise on NBC\\'s Today on June 24, 2005.Medical authorities view Cruise\\'s comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness. Shields herself called Cruise\\'s comments \"a disservice to mothers everywhere.\" In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the psychoactive drugs which are routinely prescribed for treatment.  It was reported that Cruise\\'s anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise\\'s presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor\\'s office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.\\n\\nYouTube video removal\\nOn January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him. The Church of Scientology said the video had been \"pirated and edited,\" and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology. YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.After YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the fair use clause. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of June 2020, the video has achieved over 14 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the website.\\n\\nScientology\\'s purported influence on Cruise\\nIn 2013, Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple\\'s daughter Suri from Scientology. He also said that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the church.In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise\\'s next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, Cruise\\'s sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005. DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan. Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.The 2015 documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief cast a spotlight on Cruise\\'s role in Scientology. The film alleges that Cruise used Sea Org workers as a source of free labor. In the film, Cruise\\'s former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Tom Cruise\\'s suggestion, which Cruise\\'s lawyer denies.\\n\\nLegacy\\nIn 2006, Premiere ranked Cruise as Hollywood\\'s most powerful actor, as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine\\'s 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor. The same year, Forbes magazine ranked him as the world\\'s most powerful celebrity. The founder of CinemaScore in 2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the \"two stars, it doesn\\'t matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up\".October 10, 2006, was declared \"Tom Cruise Day\" in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because of \"his love for and close association with Japan.\" While reviewing Days of Thunder, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise\\'s 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the Tom Cruise Picture. Ebert listed nine key ingredients that make up the Tom Cruise Picture; the Cruise character, the mentor, the superior woman, the craft he must hone, the arena it takes place in, the arcana or knowledge he must learn, the trail or journey, the proto enemy, and the eventual enemy of the character. Some of Cruise\\'s later films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered to be part of this formula.\\n\\nWidescreenings compares two of these Cruise characters in an article on the film A Few Good Men,\\n[screenwriter] Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a \\'hot shot\\' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.\\n\\nLitigation\\nIn 1998, Tom Cruise successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality. Cruise won the libel case.In May 2001, Cruise filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had told the celebrity magazine Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise, and Slater was later ordered to pay $10 million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. Cruise requested a default judgment and, in January 2003, a Los Angeles judge decided against Slater after the porn actor said that his story was false.Cruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis for $100 million, because Davis had alleged (though never confirmed) that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.In 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise\\'s behest. That suit was dismissed by a Central Civil West court judge in Los Angeles on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired on Sapir\\'s claim.In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In Touch and Life & Style magazines for defamation after they claimed Cruise had \"abandoned\" his six-year-old daughter. During deposition, Cruise testified that due to his work load 110 days had passed without him seeing her. The suit was ultimately settled between the two parties.\\n\\nFilmography\\nAwards and nominations\\nSee also\\nProject Chanology § Tom Cruise video\\nRock of Ages soundtrack (2012)\\nSupercouple\\nTom Cruise: Unauthorized (1998)\\nTom Cruise: All the World\\'s a Stage (2006)\\nTom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography (2008)\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\n\\nTom Cruise – official site\\nTom Cruise at AllMovie\\nTom Cruise discography at Discogs\\nTom Cruise on Facebook\\nTom Cruise at IMDb\\nTom Cruise at the TCM Movie Database\\nTom Cruise on Twitter\\nTom Cruise on Yahoo!

              " \"Tom Cruise: All the World's a Stage\": 'Tom Cruise: All the World\\'s A Stage is an authorized biography of actor Tom Cruise, written by British film critic Iain Johnstone.  The book was first published by Hodder & Stoughton in a paperback format and an audiobook in 2006, and then again in a hardcover format on March 1, 2007, and a second paperback release, on May 1, 2007.\\n\\nContents\\nTom Cruise: All the World\\'s A Stage details some of Cruise\\'s early life, and his role as head of the family after his father left to become \"an itinerant hippy in California.\"  The author chronicles Cruise\\'s film career, including his first role in Endless Love in 1981, his breakthrough in Risky Business, and other popular films such as Top Gun, Jerry Maguire and the Mission: Impossible films.  He cites Cruise\\'s role as \"Frank Mackey\" in the film Magnolia as one of his best performances.  Johnstone also writes about Cruise\\'s relationships with Mimi Rogers and Nicole Kidman, and the luxurious lifestyle maintained by Cruise and Kidman during their relationship.  Johnstone puts Kidman in a sympathetic light regarding their 2001 divorce.The book discusses Cruise\\'s relationship with Scientology, and controversy in the media, including his public criticism of actress Brooke Shields, and his \"TV sofa-bouncing.\"  He also discusses the lengthy production of director Stanley Kubrick\\'s Eyes Wide Shut, noting the fact that Universal Studios and Paramount Pictures allowed representatives from the Church of Scientology to frequent the film sets during production.\\n\\nReception\\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian called the book \"an unpretentious model of clarity and humility, simply rounding up the known facts.\"  In his review of the 2006 edition of the book, Bradshaw wrote that Johnstone had presented a neutral overview of events in Cruise\\'s life, and did not offer any strong opinions of his own in the book.  He criticized the work for being \"incurious about what it is like\" to be Tom Cruise.  In his review in The Independent, William Cook described the tone of the book as \"respectful not reverential\".  Cook also wrote: \"Johnstone\\'s businesslike biog feels as if written at arm\\'s length - but this distance allows him to state some awkward facts about Cruise\\'s Scientology. It\\'s hard to believe he could have been quite so frank in an authorised biography.\"The book received a critical review in The West Australian, and a review in Australia\\'s The Daily Telegraph thought the book was almost \"dull\".  Christopher Bray of London\\'s The Daily Telegraph also criticized the work, and wrote that the book failed to answer any of the \"interesting questions\", commenting: \"You will read this book in vain for any suggestion that what we think we know of Cruise\\'s real life might be no more than PR smoke and mirrors.\"  In a review in The Spectator, Roger Lewis was critical of the book, and wrote: \"The eulogies Johnstone collects are endless.\"  Barbara Chabai of the Winnipeg Free Press also criticized the lack of depth to the work, writing that Johnstone \"has simply repackaged facts from Cruise\\'s interviews with other reporters into a neat but unfeeling tome that offers all the depth of an Entertainment Tonight feature.\"  Both The Guardian and the Winnipeg Free Press noted the absence of any discussion or mention of the controversial 2005 episode of South Park which spoofed Cruise, \"Trapped in the Closet\".\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nBeing Tom Cruise\\nRelationship of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\\nTrapped in the Closet (South Park)\\nTom Cruise: Unauthorized (1998)\\nTom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography (2008)\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",
              " 'Tony Scott': 'Anthony David Scott (21 June 1944 – 19 August 2012) was an English film director and producer. He was known for directing highly successful action and thriller films such as Top Gun (1986), Beverly Hills Cop II (1987), Days of Thunder (1990), The Last Boy Scout (1991), True Romance (1993), Crimson Tide (1995), Enemy of the State (1998), Man on Fire (2004), Déjà Vu (2006), and Unstoppable (2010).\\nScott was the younger brother of film director Sir Ridley Scott. They both graduated from the Royal College of Art in London, and were among a generation of British film directors who were successful in Hollywood having started their careers making television commercials. In 1995, both Tony and Ridley received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema. In 2010, they received the BAFTA Britannia Award for Worldwide Contribution to Filmed Entertainment.\\n\\nEarly life\\nScott was born in Tynemouth, Northumberland, North East England, the youngest of three sons of Elizabeth (née Williams) and Colonel Francis Percy Scott, who served in the Royal Engineers. Dixon Scott, a great uncle, was a pioneer of the cinema chain, opening cinemas around Tyneside. One Tyneside Cinema, in Newcastle, is the last remaining newsreel cinema operating in the United Kingdom.  Tony followed in his elder brother\\'s footsteps, studying at Grangefield School, West Hartlepool College of Art and graduating from Sunderland Art School with a fine arts degree. At the age of 16, he appeared in the short film Boy and Bicycle, Ridley\\'s directorial debut (he was 23).Tony Scott continued his studies in art in Leeds after failing to gain admission to the Royal College of Art in London (he would succeed in a later attempt). In 1969, he made a short film based on the Ambrose Bierce story One of the Missing. As Ridley had previously cast him in a film, Tony reciprocated by giving his brother a role in the production. \"The film cost £1,000\", he recalled in April 2012. While at the Royal College of Art, where he was taught by Raymond Durgnat, he starred in \"Don\\'t Walk\", a film by fellow students Hank Onrust and Richard Stanley. The film credits state it was \"made for BUNAC by MARCA films at the Royal College of Art\". Again following in Ridley\\'s footsteps, Tony graduated from the Royal College of Art, although he intended to become a painter. Their eldest brother Frank had earlier joined the British Merchant Navy.\\n\\nFilm career\\nCommercials\\nThe success of his elder brother\\'s fledgling television commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), drew Tony\\'s attention to film. Ridley recounted, \"Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first. I told him, \\'Don\\'t go to the BBC, come to me first.\\' I knew that he had a fondness for cars, so I told him, \\'Come work with me and within a year you\\'ll have a Ferrari.\\' And he did!\" Tony recalled, \"I was finishing eight years at art school, and Ridley had opened Ridley Scott Associates and said, \\'Come and make commercials and make some money\\' because I owed money left and right and centre.\" He directed many television commercials for RSA while also overseeing the company\\'s operation while his brother was developing his feature film career. \"My goal was to make films but I got sidetracked into commercials and then I took off. I had 15 years [making them], and it was a blast. We were very prolific, and that was our training ground. You\\'d shoot 100 days in a year, then we gravitated from that to film,\" he said. Developing his own distinctive visual style while making commercials, Scott states, \"I cornered the market in sexy, rock\\'n\\'roll stuff.\"Scott took time out in 1975 to direct a television adaptation of the Henry James story The Author of Beltraffio. After the feature film successes of fellow British directors Hugh Hudson, Alan Parker, Adrian Lyne and his elder brother during the late 1970\\'s, all of whom had graduated from directing advertising commercials, he received initial overtures from Hollywood in 1980. His eldest brother Frank died, aged 45, of skin cancer during the same year.\\n\\nEarly films\\nScott reflected on his career in 2009:\\nThe \\'80s was a whole era. We were criticised, we being the Brits coming over, because we were out of advertising—Alan Parker, Hugh Hudson, Adrian Lyne, my brother—we were criticised about style over content. Jerry Bruckheimer was very bored of the way American films were very traditional and classically done. Jerry was always looking for difference. That\\'s why I did six movies with Jerry. He always applauded the way I wanted to approach things. That period in the \\'80s was a period when I was constantly being criticised, and my press was horrible. I never read any press after The Hunger.\\nScott persisted in trying to embark on a feature film career. Among the ideas interesting to him was an adaptation of the Anne Rice novel Interview with the Vampire then in development. MGM was already developing the vampire film The Hunger, and hired Scott in 1982. The Hunger starred David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve and introduced Willem Dafoe in a small role. Despite its elaborate photography and sumptuous production design it failed to find an audience or to impress the critics, and performed poorly at the box office, though it later became a cult favourite. Finding few film opportunities in Hollywood over the next two and a half years, Scott returned to commercials and music videos.In 1985, producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer approached Scott to direct Top Gun, having been impressed by The Hunger, and a commercial he had done for Swedish automaker Saab in 1983, called \"Nothing on Earth Comes Close\", and featuring a Saab 900 turbo racing a Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet. Scott, initially reluctant, finally agreed to direct Top Gun. While the film received mixed critical review, it was a box office smash, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1986, taking in more than $350 million, and making a star of its young protagonist, Tom Cruise. Labelling Top Gun “the key 1980s movie made by the British ad invasion“, Sam Delaney of The Guardian writes, \"By the mid-80\\'s, Hollywood was awash with British directors who had ushered in a new era of blockbusters using the crowd-pleasing skills they\\'d honed in advertising. The vast resources and freedom made available to ad directors during advertising\\'s boom era during the 1970\\'s enabled them to innovate and experiment with new techniques that weren\\'t then possible in TV or film.\"\\n\\nHollywood success\\nFollowing the stellar success of Top Gun, Scott found himself on Hollywood\\'s A-list of action directors. He re-teamed with Simpson and Bruckheimer in 1987 to direct Eddie Murphy and Brigitte Nielsen in the highly anticipated sequel Beverly Hills Cop II. It left critics underwhelmed, but was among the year\\'s highest grossing films. His next feature, Revenge (1990), a thriller of adultery and revenge set in Mexico, starred Kevin Costner, Madeleine Stowe and Anthony Quinn. Once again directing Tom Cruise, Scott returned to the Simpson-Bruckheimer fold to helm the big-budget racing film Days of Thunder (1990). Scott later stated that it was difficult to find the drama in racing cars in circles, so he \"stole from all race movies to date ... then tried to build on them.\" Scott\\'s next film was the cult action thriller The Last Boy Scout (1991) starring Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans and written by Shane Black.\\nIn 1993, Scott directed True Romance costing just $13 million, from a script by Quentin Tarantino. The cast included Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, Val Kilmer and in bit roles, James Gandolfini and Samuel L. Jackson. Although it received positive reviews from Janet Maslin and other critics, it took less than it cost to make and was considered a box office failure, although it has since attained cult status. For his next film, Crimson Tide (1995), Scott again teamed up with producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. A submarine thriller starring Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington it was critically and commercially well-received.\\nIn 1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Tony and Ridley Scott, which extensively renovated the studios - located in Britain - while also expanding and improving its grounds. In 1996, Scott directed The Fan, starring Robert De Niro, Wesley Snipes, Ellen Barkin and Benicio del Toro. His 1998 film Enemy of the State, a conspiracy thriller, starred Will Smith and Gene Hackman, and was his highest-grossing film of the decade. Spy Game was released in November, 2001, and garnered 63% positive reviews at Metacritic and topped $60m at the US box office. Scott subsequently directed another thriller starring Denzel Washington, Man on Fire, released in April 2004.\\nTony teamed up with Ridley to co-produce the TV series Numb3rs, which aired from 2005 to 2010, with Tony directing the first episode of the fourth season. In 2006, he contributed voice-over to a song called Dreamstalker on Hybrid\\'s album I Choose Noise; Scott has collaborated with Hybrid on several films through their mutual friend, the highly successful film score composer,  Harry Gregson-Williams.\\nIn 2005, Tony Scott directed Domino, starring Keira Knightley. While notable for its use of experimental film techniques, it was drubbed by critics and rejected by audiences. In autumn 2006, Scott again worked with Denzel Washington, this time on a sci-fi action film, Déjà Vu. The two collaborated again on The Taking of Pelham 123, a remake of the 1974 film of the same title, and which starred John Travolta. It was released on 12 June 2009. 2009 also saw the debut of The Good Wife, a legal drama television series on which Tony and Ridley Scott were executive producers.In 2010, the Scott brothers produced the feature film adaptation of the television series The A-Team. The same year saw the release of Scott\\'s latest collaboration Denzel Washington, Unstoppable, which starred Chris Pine), and hit the screens in November.Shortly before his untimely death, Tony Scott  produced Coma, a medical thriller miniseries, the Coca-Cola short film The Polar Bears and the thrillers Stoker and The East, the latter two with his brother, Ridley.\\n\\nUnreleased projects\\nScott developed a film adaptation of Clifford Irving\\'s novel Tom Mix and Pancho Villa (1981) for over a decade. In November 2003, he scouted locations in Mexico, and Steven Zaillian was writing the screenplay. \"This is Lawrence of Arabia meets The Wild Bunch, a huge film with trains, cavalry, thousands of soldiers in uniform and on horseback,\" Scott said.In late 2006, Scott announced a remake of the action thriller The Warriors (1979). \"The original Warriors was New York in the 1970s, and everything went upwards, everything went vertically. And now I\\'m making it a contemporary thing and doing it in L.A., so everything is horizontal. So my vision of The Warriors is Los Angeles in 2007 and the gangs, instead of being 30, are going to be 3,000 or 5,000,\" he said. Scott met with actual gang members for research: \"I\\'ve met all the heads of all the different gangs, so I\\'ve already educated myself. They all said, \\'Listen dude, if you get this on we\\'ll sign a treaty and we\\'ll all stand on the Long Beach Bridge. There\\'ll be 150,000 members there. It\\'ll look like the L.A. Marathon.\\'\" Scott was simultaneously developing a drama project titled Emma\\'s War about British foreign aid worker Emma McCune. Scott said in October 2006, \"It\\'s been a difficult piece to crack. We had one writer aboard who did a pass at the script and didn\\'t get it, but we\\'ve got someone else onboard now who I\\'m going to make live down there and smell it, touch it, feel it. There\\'s nothing that can compare to that kind of first-hand experience.\"Tom Cruise was with Scott just two days prior to the director\\'s suicide, scouting locations for a sequel to Top Gun, scheduled for production in 2013. In December 2012, Paramount announced that the project was officially cancelled, but they would go ahead with a 3D IMAX remastering of the original Top Gun, which was released on 8 February 2013. In June 2013 it was confirmed by Bruckheimer that Top Gun 2 has been given the greenlight once again. Scott was also slated to direct Narco Sub, from a script by David Guggenheim and Mark Bomback, about \"a disgraced American naval officer forced to pilot a sub carrying a payload of cocaine to America.\" Scott was also considering a remake of the classic western The Wild Bunch (1969).\\n\\nDirecting style\\nKatey Rich of Cinema Blend wrote that Scott had a \"trademark frenetic camera style,\" which Scott spoke about in June 2009, in reference to The Taking of Pelham 123:It\\'s about energy and it\\'s about momentum, and I think the movie\\'s very exciting, and it\\'s not one individual thing. The true excitement comes from the actors—that gives you the true drama—and whatever I can do with the camera, that\\'s icing on the cake. I wanted the movie to grab you. I use four cameras and I maybe do three takes—so the actors love it. Maybe I move it more than I should, but that\\'s the nature of the way I am.\\nScott also spoke about his career in general:What always leads me in terms of my movies are characters. [I tell my production team] \\'Go into the real world, cast these people in the real world, and find me role models for my writers.\\' Then I reverse-engineer. I don\\'t change the structure of the script, but I use my research. That\\'s always been my mantra, and that\\'s what gets me excited, because I get to educate and entertain myself in terms of worlds I could never normally touch, other than the fact that I\\'m a director. [...] If you look at my body of work, there\\'s always a dark side to my characters. They\\'ve always got a skeleton in the closet, they\\'ve always got a subtext. I like that. Whether it\\'s Bruce Willis in Last Boy Scout or Denzel Washington in The Taking of Pelham 123. I think fear, and there\\'s two ways of looking at fear. The most frightening thing I do in my life is getting up and shooting movies. Commercials, movies, every morning I\\'m bolt upright on one hour two hours sleep, before the alarm clock goes off. That\\'s a good thing. That fear motivates me, and I enjoy that fear. I\\'m perverse in that way. I do other things. I\\'ve rock climbed all my life. Whenever I finish a movie, I do multi-day ascents, I go hang on a wall in Yosemite. That fear is tangible. That\\'s black and white. I can make this hold or that hold. The other fear is intangible, it\\'s very abstract, and that\\'s more frightening. \\nManohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that Scott was \"one of the most influential film directors of the past 25 years, if also one of the most consistently and egregiously underloved by critics\" and called him \"[o]ne of the pop futurists of the contemporary blockbuster.\" She felt that \"[t]here was plenty about his work that was problematic and at times offensive, yet it could have terrific pop, vigor, beauty and a near pure cinema quality. These were, more than anything, films by someone who wanted to pull you in hard and never let you go.\"Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"the propulsive, at times borderline preposterous popcorn-thriller storylines; the slice-and-dice editing and the images that somehow managed to glow with grit; the fireball violence, often glimpsed in smeary-techno telephoto shots; the way he had of making actors seem volatile and dynamic and, at the same time, lacking almost any subtext\" were qualities of Scott\\'s films that both \"excited audiences about his work\" and \"kept him locked outside the gates of critical respectability.\"Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that after Top Gun, Scott \"found his commercial niche as a brash, flashy, sometimes vulgar action painter on celluloid,\" citing Beverly Hills Cop II, Days of Thunder, The Last Boy Scout, True Romance, and The Fan as examples. McCarthy concluded that Unstoppable, Scott\\'s final film, was one of his best. Apart from having \"its director\\'s fingerprints all over it—the commitment to extreme action, frenetic cutting, stripped-down dialogue\"—McCarthy found \"a social critique embedded in its guts; it was about disconnected working class stiffs living marginal lives on society\\'s sidings, about the barely submerged anger of a neglected underclass,\" something which \"always had been lacking from Tony Scott\\'s work, some connection to the real world rather than just silly flyboy stuff and meaningful glances accompanied by this year\\'s pop music hit.\" Betsy Sharkey of The Los Angeles Times wrote that Denzel Washington—who starred in Crimson Tide, Man on Fire, Déjà Vu, The Taking of Pelham 123, and Unstoppable—was Scott\\'s muse, and Scott \"was at his best when Washington was in the picture. The characters the actor played are the archetype of the kind of men Scott made. At their core, and what guided all the actions that followed, was a fundamental decency. They were flawed men to be sure, some more than others, but men who accorded dignity to anyone who deserved it.\"\\n\\nPersonal life\\nScott married three times. His first marriage was to BAFTA Award winning TV production designer Gerry Boldy (1944–2007) in 1967. They were divorced in 1974. His second marriage was in 1986 to advertising executive Glynis Sanders. They divorced a year later when his affair with Brigitte Nielsen (married to Sylvester Stallone at the time), whom he met on the set of Beverly Hills Cop II, became public. He subsequently met film and TV actress Donna Wilson, who was 24 years his junior, on the set of Days of Thunder in 1990; they married in 1994. She gave birth to their twin sons, Frank and Max, in 2000.\\n\\nDeath\\nOn 19 August 2012, at approximately 12:30 pm. PDT, Scott died by suicide by jumping off the Vincent Thomas Bridge in the San Pedro port district of Los Angeles. Investigators from the Los Angeles Police Department\\'s Harbor Division found contact information in a note left in his car, parked on the bridge, and a note at his office for his family. One witness said he did not hesitate before jumping, but another said he looked nervous before climbing a fence, hesitating for two seconds, and jumping into the water beside a tour boat. His body was recovered from the water by the Los Angeles Port Police. On 22 August, Los Angeles County coroner\\'s spokesman Ed Winters said the two notes Scott left behind made no mention of any health problems, but neither the police nor the family disclosed the content of those notes.On 22 October 2012, the Los Angeles County Coroner\\'s Office announced the cause of death as \"multiple blunt force injuries.\" Therapeutic levels of the antidepressant mirtazapine and the sleep aid eszopiclone were in his system at the time of death A coroner\\'s official said Scott \"did not have any serious underlying medical conditions\" and that there was \"no anatomic evidence of neoplasia [cancer] identified.\"In a November 2014 interview with Variety, Ridley Scott, while describing his brother\\'s death as \"inexplicable\", contradicted the coroner\\'s official verdict by saying that Tony had been \"fighting a lengthy battle with cancer — a diagnosis the family elected to keep private during his treatments and in the immediate wake of his death.\"\\n\\nFuneral and legacy\\nA family press release on 22 August 2012, stated that \"The family will announce plans after Labour Day for a gathering to celebrate the life and work of Tony Scott. Details will be forthcoming once they are formalised.\" The family announced that they had established a scholarship fund at the American Film Institute in Scott\\'s name, stating, \"The family ask that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the fund to help encourage and engage future generations of filmmakers.\" He was cremated, and his ashes were interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery on 24 August in Los Angeles. Subsequently, it was reported that he had left his estate to his family trust.Many actors paid tribute to him, including Tom Cruise, Christian Slater, Val Kilmer, Eddie Murphy, Denzel Washington, Gene Hackman, Elijah Wood, Dane Cook, Dwayne Johnson, Stephen Fry, Peter Fonda and Keira Knightley, as well as musical collaborators Hybrid. Cruise complimented Scott as \"a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable.\" Denzel Washington, Scott\\'s most frequent acting collaborator, said, \"Tony Scott was a great director, a genuine friend and it is unfathomable to think that he is now gone.\" Directors UK chairman Charles Sturridge said Scott was \"a brilliant British director with an extraordinary ability to create energy on screen, both in action and in the creation of character.\"The first episode of Coma and the first episode of season 4 of The Good Wife were dedicated in his memory. His brother Ridley\\'s films The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings were also dedicated in memory of him. Ridley also paid tribute to Tony at the 2016 Golden Globes, after his film, The Martian, won Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.\\n\\nFilmography\\nFilms\\nFeature filmsShort and mid-length films\\n\\nTelevision\\nThe Hunger (1 episode in 1997 and 1 in 1999)\\nAFP: American Fighter Pilot, Executive producer (2002)\\nThe Gathering Storm, Executive producer (2002)\\nNumb3rs, Executive producer (2005–10)\\nThe Good Wife, Executive producer (2009–12)\\nGettysburg, Executive producer (2011)\\nLabyrinth, Executive producer (2012)\\nWorld Without End, Executive producer (2012)\\nKilling Lincoln, Executive producer (2013)\\n\\nOthers\\nMusic videos\"Danger Zone\" – Kenny Loggins (1986)\\n\"One More Try\" – George Michael (1988)\\n\"Father Figure\" – George Michael (1987) directed by Andy Morahan, the love scene shot by Tony ScottCommercialsDIM Underwear (1979)\\nSAAB (1984)  “Nothing on Earth Comes Close”\\nPlayer, Achievements and Big Bang for Barclays Bank (2000)\\nTelecom Italia (2000) (Starring Marlon Brando and Woody Allen)\\nIce Soldier for US Army (2002)\\nOne Man, One Land for Marlboro (2003)\\n\\nRecurring collaborators\\nActors and actresses\\n\\nFilm crew\\nSee also\\nScott Free Productions\\n\\nReferences\\nFurther reading\\nGerosa, Mario ed.

              " 'Top Gear (2002 TV series)': 'Top Gear is a British motoring magazine and factual television programme, designed as a relaunched version of the original 1977 show of the same name by Jeremy Clarkson and Andy Wilman for the BBC, and premiered on 20 October 2002. The programme focuses on the examination and reviewing of motor vehicles, primarily cars, though this was expanded upon after the broadcast of its earlier series to incorporate films featuring motoring-based challenges, special races, timed laps of notable cars, and celebrity timed laps on a course specially-designed for the relaunched programme. The programme drew acclaim for its visual and presentation style since its launch, which focused on being entertaining to viewers, as well as criticism over the controversial nature of its content. The programme was primarily aired on BBC Two from its conception, until in 2020 when it was moved to BBC One for its twenty-ninth series.\\nSince its premiere in 2002, the programme has been presented by several hosts. Its first series was presented by Clarkson, Richard Hammond and Jason Dawe, with Wilman as the show\\'s executive producer, and the programme featuring an anonymous test driver \"The Stig\", an individual played by numerous racing drivers over the course of the show\\'s history. Following the first series, Dawe was replaced by James May, with the line-up unchanged until the end of the twenty-second series, when the BBC chose to not renew Clarkson\\'s contract on 25 March 2015, following an incident during filming. His dismissal from Top Gear prompted the departure of Hammond, May and Wilman from the programme, who joined Clarkson in forming a new motoring series.After the group\\'s departure, others were appointed as hosts for the programme, including Chris Evans and American Matt LeBlanc, both joined by four co-presenters for the twenty-third series: Rory Reid, Sabine Schmitz, Chris Harris and Eddie Jordan. After negative feedback on this series, Evans resigned from the programme, with LeBlanc joined by Harris and Reid as the main hosts for the following three series. From the twenty-seventh series onwards, the presenting line-up was changed following the departure of LeBlanc and Reid, with Harris joined by Andrew Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness as the main presenters.\\nTop Gear has been one of the BBC\\'s most commercially successful programmes since its relaunch. It has become a significant show in British popular culture, with episodes also broadcast internationally in many countries in Europe, North America, Southeast Asia and more, making it the most widely broadcast factual television programme in the world. Its success has led to various forms of merchandising, including live tours, special DVD editions, and books, as well as spawning a variety of international versions in various countries, including the United States, Australia, South Korea, China and France.\\n\\nDevelopment\\nAfter the BBC cancelled the original format of Top Gear in December 2001, Jeremy Clarkson and producer Andy Wilman met together to work out ideas for reviving the programme for television. This led to them eventually meeting the broadcaster to pitch the idea of changing it from a motoring magazine format to one that was studio-based. Amongst the ideas that were pitched included: the involvement of a fixed location for car reviews and other films, alongside locations across Britain and abroad; putting notable cars through a timed lap of a circuit; the involvement of test driver with veteran racing experience, who handle driving some of the cars for the programme; and the participation of celebrity guest who would be invited to take part in an episode, undertake an interview over motoring matters, such as their car history, and take part in a special challenge to do a timed lap in a designated car. Following the pitch, the BBC decided to green-light the new format, in order to create a programme to compete with Channel 5\\'s new motoring show Fifth Gear, from which several original Top Gear presenters including Tiff Needell, Vicki Butler-Henderson and producer Jon Bentley went to.\\nProduction began in mid-2002, with the broadcaster securing the right to use Dunsfold Aerodrome, an airport and business park in Waverley, Surrey, as the programme\\'s fixed location – while its runways and taxiways were allocated for reviews and other films, one of the site\\'s large aircraft hangars was transformed into Top Gear\\'s new studio. To match the proposed ideas for the new format, the BBC gained assistance from Lotus to design a race circuit for use on the programme that would be situated at the fixed location, while editing of films that were recorded for each episode, focused on extending the runtime of the programme to one hour. Wilman took on the role of the show\\'s executive producer, while Clarkson became part of the hosting line-up. Because those who had worked with Clarkson on the original programme had left the BBC to work on Fifth Gear, the production team arranged for him to be joined by Richard Hammond and Jason Dawe.\\nA difficulty found during production revolved around the show\\'s test driver – neither Clarkson nor Wilman could find a racing driver with experience at speaking on-camera. In discussions over this, the pair opted to make the driver silent, and later having their identity concealed. When they recruited Perry McCarthy amongst their possible candidates for the role, his input led to Wilman choosing to nickname the test driver \"the Stig\".\\nTo date, there have been 12 presenters of the show:\\n\\nHistory\\nBeginnings: 2002–2005\\nThe first series of the new format of Top Gear premiered on 20 October 2002. In its early state, the programme\\'s segments were based on elements of the previous format, such as interviews and viewers\\' letters, but also featured some new humorous elements, such as the presenters regularly destroying a caravan during the early series.\\nAfter the first series, Dawe was replaced by James May. Having previously been a presenter on Channel 4\\'s motoring programme Driven and the 1999 series of Top Gear, May initially declined to be a part of the new format, until its growing popularity later changed his mind.\\nAt the beginning of the third series, McCarthy was replaced by Ben Collins for contractual reasons – the change in drivers was notable in the fact that for Collins\\' version, the Stig\\'s outfit was changed from a black outfit to a white one.\\nAs the programme progressed, the format slowly began to transform, with a focus towards creating a unique presentation style for the programme, which included the addition of new segments, a more unusual approach to reviewing cars, road trips, and more specialised films involving races – either between cars or between a car and another form of transportation – and completing a variety of challenges, mostly with cheap, second-hand cars.\\n\\nChanges and growing popularity: 2006–2014\\nIn early 2006, the BBC made plans to move the programme\\'s film site from Dunsfold to Enstone, Oxfordshire, in preparation for its eighth series. These were later cancelled, after West Oxfordshire council strongly objected to the planned move, on the basis of noise and pollution concerns. As a direct result, the broadcaster ordered that filming continued at Dunsfold during May of that year, despite having no permit to do so, with the eighth series unveiling a revamped studio set. In addition, the \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\" segment was modified with new rules along with a new car, while Hammond included one of his dogs for the series throughout its studio segments, along with a number of films made for this series and the next.\\nOn 20 September, during production for the ninth series, Hammond was seriously injured while driving a Vampire turbojet drag racing car at up to 314 miles per hour (505 km/h), as part of a planned feature, leading the BBC to postpone the broadcast of Best of Top Gear until a later date, and delaying production on the series until the presenter had recovered. Both the BBC and the Health and Safety Executive carried out inquiries into the accident, with filming later resuming on 5 October. The opening episode of the ninth series, aired on 28 January 2007, included footage of Hammond\\'s crash; while it was not repeated like other episodes in the programme, it attracted higher ratings than the finale of Celebrity Big Brother, providing one of the highest ratings for BBC Two for a decade, alongside the series finale, which attracted around 8 million viewers.\\nLater that summer, on 25 July, the BBC aired a special edition episode entitled Top Gear: Polar Special. It was one of the first episodes of the programme to be shown in high-definition, and the third special to be produced, focusing on a race to the North Magnetic Pole, at its recorded location in 1996, between a \"polar modified\" Toyota Hilux and a dog sled. Considerable planning and co-ordination for the filming of the episode was conducted by both Top Gear\\'s production team and Toyota, with both Clarkson and May, driving the Hilux, being the first people to reach the recorded location of the North Magnetic Pole by car. It was one of a number of challenges in which the presenters had to be focused and serious, despite the comedic scenes shown, with another being on 9 September, when the presenters, including The Stig, participated in the 2007 Britcar 24-hour race at Silverstone, using a race-prepared, second-hand diesel BMW 330d, fuelled by biodiesel refined from crops they had sown as part of an earlier feature.\\nWith popularity for the show rising to considerable levels, the waiting list to get a ticket for a recording became extensive – an individual seeking a ticket, found that they would be required to wait for 21 years before securing a place. On 17 June 2008, Hammond and May revealed during an interview on BBC Radio 1\\'s The Chris Moyles Show, that the eleventh series would feature a new \"host\" in the line-up, who was later revealed on the programme as \"Top Gear Stunt Man\", an individual who made few, occasional appearances on the programme. From the twelfth series, feature-length specials were created for the show, each visiting a different part of the world for a road trip using second-hand cars, with a number produced to be aired as a Christmas special. Despite growing popularity, an interview made with the Radio Times by Wilman revealed that future programmes would have less time devoted to big challenges, stating the following:\\n\"We\\'ve looked back at the last two or three runs and noticed that a programme can get swallowed up by one monster film – a bit like one of those Yes albums from the 1970s where side one is just one track – so we\\'re trying to calm down the prog-rock side. We\\'ll inevitably still have big films, because it\\'s the only way you can enjoy the three of them cocking about together, but they\\'ll be shorter overall, and alongside we\\'ll be inserting two- or three-minute punk songs.\"\\nThe success of the programme soon led to a live-version format being created called Top Gear Live; produced by a former producer of the programme, Rowland French, the touring show aimed to attempt to \"bring the TV show format to life... featuring breath-taking stunts, amazing special effects and blockbusting driving sequences featuring some of the world\\'s best precision drivers\". The Live tour began on 30 October 2008 in Earls Court, London, moving on to Birmingham in November before being performed in at least 15 other countries worldwide.\\nAs the 14th series was being broadcast in late 2009, the programme began to attract criticism from some viewers, over its predictability through the over-reliance on stunts and forced humour at the expense of serious content. On 13 December 2009, controller of BBC Two Janice Hadlow appeared on the BBC\\'s Points of View to reject such comments, purely on the evidence of Top Gear\\'s ratings and audience appreciation figures. However, a week later on 20 December, Wilman admitted that the three presenters were now \"playing to their TV cartoon characters a bit too much\". His statement included referring to \"this incarnation of Top Gear\" being close to its end, and that the production team would be working towards keeping its \"dignity still intact\", while experimenting with new ideas for the programme. Nevertheless, a one-off special of the long-running US news programme 60 Minutes featuring Clarkson, Hammond, and May, attracted 16 million viewers in October 2010.\\n\\nHiatus and Clarkson\\'s suspension: 2015\\nTowards the end of 2014, the BBC became concerned over Clarkson\\'s behaviour on the programme, including its production. Their concerns were raised by two incidents that year. The first involved an un-aired take from the 19th series emerging on national news media, featuring the presenter attempting to choose between two cars using the traditional rhyme \"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe\" but failing to censor the original version\\'s use of the N-word. The second involved an investigation into racism complaints by the regulator Ofcom, in regards to the show\\'s \"Burma Special\", which led to the programme being found in breach of broadcasting rules: the presenters had been involved in constructing a bridge, when Clarkson, seeing an Asian man crossing it, remarked that the bridge \\'had a slope on it\\'. As a result of these matters, the broadcast issued a \"final warning\" against Clarkson. The programme then suffered another incident, when production of its next special in Argentina was dogged by major issues that placed the team at serious risk of harm, as one of the car license plates had read \"H982 FKL\" in an alleged reference to the Falklands War of 1982. The controversial incident it created was covered by international news media, but despite the issues faced, the special was later aired as part of the BBC\\'s Christmas schedule for 2014, though with amendments to its ending and the inclusion of an introduction for it.\\nOn 10 March 2015, the 22nd series of the programme was abruptly put into hiatus by the BBC. The broadcaster\\'s actions were the result of them suspending Clarkson in order to investigate allegations made against him, over verbal and physical abuse he had committed against one of the show\\'s producers, Oisin Tymon. On 25 March, Clarkson\\'s contract with the BBC was terminated, with Director-General of the BBC Tony Hall announcing that the remaining episodes future were uncertain until the broadcaster could determine how to air them out and complete the 22nd series. Clarkson\\'s forced departure soon had a considerable impact with the programme, beginning with that year\\'s Top Gear Live – as a result of the BBC\\'s decision, the tour\\'s name was changed to \"Clarkson, Hammond and May Live\" and announced on 1 April 2015. Wilman later revealed on 23 April that he would be resigning from the programme, along with Clarkson\\'s co-presenters May and Hammond, having stated that they would not continue working on Top Gear without Clarkson; however, the group consented to making one final episode for the BBC consisting of the trio\\'s final films, which was aired as a special on 28 June 2015. Following this episode, Hammond, May and Wilman joined up with Clarkson, and subsequently signed a deal with Amazon to produce a new motoring programme in the same vein as their former show, which debuted in 2016 under the title of The Grand Tour.\\n\\nPresenter reshuffling: 2016–2019\\nFollowing the departure of Clarkson, and the subsequent departure of May, Hammond and Wilman, the BBC began searching for their replacements. On 16 June 2015, Chris Evans was confirmed as one of the new hosts, with it later suggested he would be hosting the show alone as part of a new format, despite a previous announcement that the broadcaster was holding open audition for his co-presenters; this claim was later dismissed as untrue. Although former Formula 1 driver David Coulthard had been widely reported to be joining the programme as a host, this was dismissed as speculation when he was revealed, on 11 January 2016, to be the new host of Channel 4\\'s coverage for the 2016 F1 season. On 4 February, it was officially announced that American actor Matt LeBlanc was to join the show as Evans\\' co-host. On an edition of his BBC Radio 2 breakfast show, a week later, Evans revealed that both men would also be joined by Eddie Jordan, motoring journalist Chris Harris, German motor racing driver Sabine Schmitz, and motoring journalist and Sky television presenter Rory Reid.Filming for the twenty-third series soon began in early 2016. While the show still retained the use of the show\\'s presentation style and its test driver The Stig, the format received a number of changes – a small number of segments were dropped, the studio received a revamp to its layout, the celebrity segment was redesigned to feature a rallycross-styled challenge, while Evans and LeBlanc would front the show with the other co-presenters appearing \"when required\". On 27 April 2016, BBC Three announced that a spin-off programme to Top Gear had been commissioned, entitled Extra Gear. Designed to be aired after each episode of the new series was aired, its format focused on providing exclusive new content online – hosted by both Reid and Harris, the spin-off would consist of new footage, interviews, specially recorded films and behind-the-scenes access to the main programme.A combination of delays with production and conflicts with scheduling, led to the premiere date of the 23rd series being pushed back to 29 May 2016. In addition, the new series aired with only six of the ten episodes that it promised to show. The new look of the show received mixed feedback from critics and viewers alike – although praise was given for the inclusion of LeBlanc, Harris and Reid, the new format was panned for its sluggish pace, the lack of humour in the studio segments, and the length of time spent on the revamped celebrity segment, \"Star in a Rally-Cross Car\". The most negative feedback received for the 23rd series was towards Evans\\' involvement – his presentation style was largely criticised, along with the lack of chemistry he had with LeBlanc. In addition to feedback, several newspaper articles highlighted the fact that the new series struggled to make reasonable viewing figures, with this partly blamed on its broadcast schedule putting it up against live broadcasts of the UEFA Euro 2016 championships. On 4 July, following the series finale, Evans announced his resignation from Top Gear, based on feedback. As a result, the BBC announced on 26 September that, among the remaining five presenters, LeBlanc would be joined by Harris and Reid to become the main hosts for the next series.To make amends for its dismal performance, Top Gear underwent a more thorough revamp, which included redoing the studio, and redesigning the show\\'s opening titles. The show\\'s format was refocused on elements developed in early series, a deeper work on chemistry between the presenters, while also revising the celebrity segment – as the arrangement for the 23rd series had proven to be a failure, the segment returned to its original format.\\n\\nNew era: 2019–present\\nOn 31 May 2018 LeBlanc announced he would be leaving the show after the twenty-sixth series. On 22 October 2018, the BBC announced the appointment of Andrew Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness to join Harris and replace LeBlanc. As a part of the reshuffle Rory Reid was announced to be stepping down as a main host to present Extra Gear and make occasional appearances on the main show, however Extra Gear did not return and so Reid moved to ITV4 to present Speed Freaks. The new presenting line-up received a positive reception compared to the mixed reviews of the previous few series.During the broadcast of the twenty-eighth series in early 2020, it was announced that, from the twenty-ninth series, the show would move channels to BBC One following the positive reception of the new presenting lineup. The twenty-ninth series itself, which was broadcast in late 2020, also saw some changes as a result of filming and broadcast during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the show moving out of the studio and onto the runway, in a \\'drive-in festival\\' style, to enable the audience members to remain physically distanced, and the dropping of the Star in a ... Car segment to maintain social distancing.For the thirtieth series the show will again vacate its usual studio to film the linking segments of the show from the BBC\\'s former television headquarters, Television Centre in West London, marking the first time in 19 years that the studio segments of the show are not being recorded at Dunsfold.\\n\\nFormat\\nEach episode of Top Gear focus a series of segments, switching between those filmed within the programme\\'s main studio before a studio audience, and pre-recorded films conducted before the broadcast of an episode – these films primarily cover major segments of the episodes, with studio segments often used as links or breaks between them. The most common forms of segments used in the show\\'s history are \"Car Reviews\", \"Power Laps\", \"Star in a ... Car\", \"Cool Wall\", \"Challenges\" and \"Races\".\\n\\nCar reviews\\nA major segment of the programme, happening at least once in most episodes, it focuses on the presenters conducting a road-test of a car, looking at such factors as ride quality, speed, handling, practicality, and reliability. These reviews are conducted either on and around Top Gear\\'s test track, or on the roads of Britain and abroad, and often focus on one car, primarily from well known car manufacturers. On a number of occasions, the review may feature more than one car from the same class, as well as include exotic/foreign models, and feature more than one presenter as a way of providing different opinions on the cars being reviewed and putting forth an argument over the model they believe is worthwhile to own.\\nAlthough the programme operated in a standard manner in the early series to the original format of car reviews in the 1977 show, it soon began to adopt an unusual approach of reviewing cars, by conducting an unusual test(s) to either put a vehicle through its paces in an arranged scenario, or to demonstrate and showcase an exceptional quality that it exhibited. An example of this comes from the \"Toyota Hilux Destruction\" film, divided between two episodes of the third series – to prove the strength of a Toyota Hilux pick-up truck, presenters Clarkson and May set about subjecting it to various, mainly destructive tests to see if it could survive against them and still run, allowing the use of tools for repair but prohibiting the replacement of any components (with the exception of the windscreen). Other notable uses of this unusual approach have included:\\n\\nTesting the ride quality of two off-road vehicles by having a passenger receive a tattoo in each vehicle as it is driven off-road, to see how smoothly it can be done in each.\\nTesting a car\\'s handling,by racing it through a shopping centre against a more powerful car.\\nAssigning the presenter\\'s mothers with the duty of reviewing a small selection of cars.\\nTesting the comfort of a vehicle by chauffeuring a VIP to an event.Another unusual approach with car reviews was to conduct them in the form of a challenge. Examples of such \"review\" challenges have included:\\n\\nRoad-testing cars in the style of \"Russian Roulette\", in which presenters did not know what they would get to drive and had to review it in the presence of their owners while driving them and their car back to their home.\\nComparing the practicality of two new vehicles by operating them as taxi cabs for a night.\\nSpending 24 hours within a car without stepping out of it any point within the time period.\\nTaking an off-road vehicle up a mountain in Scotland.\\n\\nPower laps\\nThis segment focuses on a featured car undergoing a timed lap of the programme\\'s test track, with the car driven by The Stig. Often used after the main review of an episode, it mainly involved the car or cars from the review, though it sometimes featured vehicles that either had been reviewed in a previous episode but couldn\\'t be put on the track due to problems or unfavourable conditions on the track, or were special models (such as racing versions of the car). On occasions when multiple cars did a timed lap, the episode either shows the film of each car one after the other, or alongside each other. After the film is shown, the presenter reveals the time to the studio audience and the viewer – abbreviations next to lap times, such as \"W\" for \"wet\", highlight if they were conducted under certain track conditions.\\nIn order to qualify for a place on the Power Lap Board, cars that undergo a Power Lap must fulfil certain requirements:\\nThey must be roadworthy, and make use of standard road tyres.\\nThey must be commercially available.\\nThey must be able to negotiate a speed bump.As such, vehicles that do not qualify, have their times mentioned, but do not get included on the Lapboard. Examples of this include the Renault F1 car (0:59.0) and the Caparo T1 (1:10.6), which were disqualified for failing the speed bump requirement; the Ferrari FXX (1:10.7), which was disqualified for using slick tyres; and the Pagani Zonda R (1:08.5), which was disqualified for not being road legal. In addition, non-production cars are also disallowed from the board, such as the Aston Martin DBR9 Le Mans racer.\\n\\n\"Star in a ... Car\"\\nAnother major segment in the programme, featured in the majority of episodes broadcast, the format for this involves a celebrity being invited to take part in a timed lap around Top Gear\\'s test track in a car provided for the segment. They then join the presenters in the studio for an interview, mainly about their car history, their performance in the car and a look back to the highlights from their practice laps. After viewing footage of their timed lap, their time is stated and recorded onto a leaderboard, much in a similar fashion to lap times for Power Laps, including the use of abbreviations to denote track conditions the celebrity faced. In the event that the car being used was put of action by serious mechanical damage during practice sessions, a back-up car would be provided for the celebrity to use to continue practising, and/or to do their timed lap in. Although only one celebrity is involved in this segment, in a number of episodes, including the majority of the eleventh and twenty-third series, it sometimes featured two celebrities taking part, with footage of each timed lap shown one after the other.\\nFrom the first series to the twenty-second series, when the show was presented by Clarkson, Hammond and May, the segment was entitled as \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\" – its name was derived from the fact that the celebrities drove around the test track in an affordable car available on the market. The segment was often shown during the middle of an episode, and had the celebrities interviewed by Clarkson. The affordable car used in the segment was changed several times, each being replaced after a number of series – because the new car was often different, in terms of engine specifications, power, speed, handling, and other factors, a new leaderboard would be created a direct result. In addition, the introduction of a new car would be reserved for the opening episode, with the celebrity segment pre-recorded before the series began – it featured no interview, and involved a group of celebrities taking part to set a lap time in the new car. Up until the eighth series, the rules of the segment were that celebrities were given a set number of laps to do, with the fastest amongst these being recorded, but from the ninth series onwards, the rules were changed so that they were now given a few practice laps to get to grips with both the car and the track, before conducting a timed lap. In some episodes, the invited celebrity was a F1 driver, with the segment referred to as \"F1 Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\" – while it stuck to the standard format, the only difference was that the F1 drivers were restricted to the use of the first car used in the segment, which was retained to maintain fairness with those invited.\\nDuring Evans\\' short-lived tenure as the show\\'s host, the twenty-third series saw the segment renamed \"Star in a Rally-Cross Car\". While it stuck to the same format as \"Reasonably Priced\", it featured a number of changes. The first change was that the interview, conducted with Evans, was much longer, with the celebrities involved discussing what was their favourite car in a certain field and the studio audience voting on which one they preferred. The second change, which was the primary reason for the change in name, was that celebrities drove around a specially modified, rally-cross version of the Top Gear test track – while it used the majority of the circuit, it featured two off-road sections and a small jump – in a rally-spec Mini Cooper. After the series ended, the segment received negative feedback and criticism from viewers and critics, and was dropped from the programme as a result.From the twenty-fourth series onwards, the segment\\'s format was revised, and renamed as \"Star in a Reasonably Fast Car\". While similar in format to \"Reasonably Priced\", in that celebrities were interviewed about their car history and did a timed lap around the test track, it featured a number of changes. Apart from the car being much faster the segment was split into two parts – the celebrity joined much earlier in the episode, discussed their car history with LeBlanc, Harris and Reid, gave some feedback on a film that had been shown prior to footage of their timed lap, and viewed footage of a practice lap in which Harris tutored them on how to get around the circuit in the new car, before the footage of their timed lap. This was altered slightly in Series 25, with it returning to only one part with the training run still shown.\\n\\nChallenges\\nAs part of Top Gear\\'s format, every episode has contained at least a number of segments involving challenges. In the first few series, these were focused on novelty challenges and stunts that were typically based on absurd premises, such as a bus jumping over motorcycles (as opposed to the more typical scenario of a motorcycle jumping over buses) or a nun driving a monster truck. However, these later changed into situations in which the presenters were either competing against each other with a car they chose in a series of tests, or working together to accomplish a goal, with the tagline \"How hard can it be?\" becoming a common phrase for the introduction of some of the challenges featured on the programme. Challenges that appear in episodes, mainly fall under the following categories:\\n\\n\"Cheap Car\" – The presenters are each given a budget with which to buy a second-hand car, and must adhere to certain criteria associated with the challenge (e.g. the car must be from a particular decade, or not be designed for a certain purpose). These types of challenges are often done as a competition, in that the presenters\\' choices undergo a series of tasks, which they have no prior knowledge of, that are designed to determine how well each car fares on various aspects such as reliability and power. Each presenter is scored based on how well their car did in the task. The winner in such competitions is often the presenter who scored the most points.\\n\"Car Creation\" – The presenters take on the challenge of creating a vehicle, such as a police car or hovercraft, mainly using a car they feel will be good as the basis for their design. While they mostly work together to create something unique, occasionally they will make their own designs separately and then compete against each other to see whose design is the best. Regardless of the set-up, the presenters\\' creation will undergo a series of challenges designed to determine how well it has been made and how well it suits its purpose. Many of the cars created by the presenters were later displayed at World of Top Gear at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu after their appearance.\\n\"Car Review\" Challenge (see Car Reviews above)\\nCar Sports – The presenters create their own versions of sports using cars as players, with such sports including football, rugby and ice hockey; tennis was also involved, though required a lot of editing. In 2006, a special episode entitled Top Gear Winter Olympics, featured the presenters partaking in a number of winter sport challenges that utilised cars, including a biathlon and downhill slope jumping.\\nSpecialised – The presenters undergo a specially designed challenge, in which they attempt to tackle something unique. Such challenges have included participating in the Britcar 24-hour endurance race at Silverstone Circuit, presenting a drive-time radio show, conducting roadworks within 24 hours, and making a televised advertisement for a car.\\n\\nRaces\\nAnother part of the show\\'s format was the inclusion of a race in every series by the presenters. Such races (which were sometimes referred to as \"epic\" by Clarkson) were mainly conducted over long distances, though each fell under a certain category:\\n\\n\"Car vs. Public Transport\" – In this race, one presenter took to driving between one location to another in a car, while the other presenters raced them to the finish line on another form of transport. The general emphasis on such races was to prove that a car could reach a destination much faster than by using the transportation involved in the race. Such races were usually edited to portray the result as close and to conceal the winner until the very end of the race (regardless of the actual closeness of the race).\\nNovelty Race – In these races, one of the presenters took to racing a car in a head-to-head race against an unusual opponent. Such races were arranged mainly to demonstrate the various strengths and, more often, weaknesses of cars, with opponents ranging from a marathon runner, to a pigeon and the postal service.\\n\"Cross City Race\" – One presenter takes the car and drives across the city from one point to another, while the others take on a different form of transport and try to beat them to the finish line.\\nMotorsport Race – Conducted in the fashion of a motor-racing event, these focused on bringing forth vehicles from a certain class, and racing them around a circuit to determine which one is the best. Such races involved racing drivers in control of the vehicle, and often led to fierce jostling between vehicles, usually resulting in some being knocked out of the race.\\nSpecialised Race – Not conforming to any of the above categories, these races had unique conditions and rules to them. Such races have included an economy race, in which the presenters chose a car and had to reach a finish line on the amount of fuel their choice could carry, a race between old, very powerful racing cars and new showroom cars, and a race designed with a 1949 theme, between a car, a steam train and a motorbike, to see which was the fastest transportation method from that year.\\n\\nThe Cool Wall\\nIn \"The Cool Wall\", the segment focused on an argument between two of the presenters over which cars are cool and which are not, placing photographs of these on various sections of a large board divided into a series of categories: \"Seriously Uncool\", \"Uncool\", \"Cool\", and \"Sub Zero\". This segment was purely designed for comedy, as it was mainly handled by both Clarkson and Hammond since its introduction in the sixth episode of the first series, and both presenter often argued and attempted to put a car they liked into a category that the other refused to let it be a part of, with Clarkson basing some of his arguments on how the cars would impress actress Kristin Scott Thomas, and later, BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce. Cars were placed into a specific category depending on certain attributes, which, according to Andy Wilman, were not necessarily related to the quality of the car itself. An example of this is that a car considered to be \"fashionable\" may be deemed uncool if the impact it has is massive but short-lived and the perception of it is that it looks ridiculous. A notable rule of this segment was that the car becomes \"Seriously Uncool\" if a presenter buys one.\\nThe segment was dropped after the 22nd series, following the departure of the three presenters.\\n\\nSpecials\\nIn 2006, Top Gear featured its first, feature-length, special edition episode, in which the presenters conducted a various challenges related to sporting events used in the Winter Olympics, in which cars took the place of athletes in each event. Following this special, the production team worked on creating additional, feature-length specials, in which the common theme was that the presenters conducted a road trip, mainly using a series of second-hand vehicles that they put through a series of challenges along their journey. The format often saw the presenters conduct a small filmed segment to provide an insight of what they were doing; the exception to this format was Top Gear\\'s Polar Special. A number of specials were designed to be aired as a Top Gear \"Christmas Special\", with the last three split into two parts. These special are listed below:\\n\\nAward ceremony\\nAt the end of each autumn series, hosts Clarkson, Hammond and May presented an award ceremony, in which they picked out cars on various aspects. While some were serious, others were meant as jokes against cars that the presenters hated. One award given, was to one of the presenters, referred to as \"Cock of Year\", in which they had conducted a mistake while filming the show for that year, while another was given to the celebrity who drove well, and not necessarily the fastest.\\nThe most important award given out in this special segment was \"car of the year,\" in which the only criterion was that all three presenters must come to a unanimous choice on the winning car. Past winners were:\\n\\nOn the final episode of the 14th series, a special award called \"Car of the Decade\" was given to mark the end of 2000s, and was awarded to the Bugatti Veyron, primarily as it was the only car worthy of the award.\\n\\nEpisodes\\nBroadcast\\nFirst-run episodes of the programme are shown in the United Kingdom on BBC One, and BBC One HD (previously on BBC Two for the first twenty-eight series, BBC HD between the fourteenth and nineteenth series, and BBC Two HD between the twentieth and twenty-eighth series), with repeats aired on both BBC Two and Dave (and also BBC Three before it became online-only). Episodes from the fifteenth to twenty-second series, as well as multiple specials from other series, are also available on Netflix streaming. The popularity of the programme eventually led to Top Gear being broadcast internationally in 214 different territories by the end of 2014; however the show\\'s publicist has stated that the oft-repeated claim of 350 million viewers per week is \"unreliable\".Some of the countries where the programme is broadcast are listed below along with the channels it is transmitted on:\\n\\nAwards and nominations\\nIn November 2005, Top Gear won an International Emmy in the Non-Scripted Entertainment category. In the episode where the presenters showed the award to the studio audience, Clarkson joked that he was unable to go to New York to receive the award because he was busy writing the new script.\\nTop Gear has also been nominated in three consecutive years (2004–2006) for the British Academy Television Awards in the Best Feature category. Clarkson was also nominated in the best \"Entertainment Performance\" category in 2006. In 2004 and 2005, Top Gear was also nominated for a National Television Award in the Most Popular Factual Programme category; it won the award in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2011. Accepting the award in October 2007, Richard Hammond made the comment that they really deserved it this year, because he didn\\'t have to crash to get some sympathy votes. On 20 January 2010 Top Gear was once again nominated for a National Television Award, in the category \"Best Factual Programme\" however, they lost out to Loose Women.\\nTop Gear presenters have also announced on the programme that they have won some slightly lower profile awards. In Series 10, Richard Hammond won the award for the \"Best TV Haircut\" and James May won the award for the worst. All three presenters have won the award for Heat magazine\\'s \"weirdest celebrity crush\" revealed during the news. In series 11, the Stig won an award from the Scouts for Services to Instruction. After revealing that, the Stig was shown \"attacking\" the Scouts, and the presenters coming to the conclusion that he is either terrified of Scouts or was a Girl Guide.\\nAt the end of 2009 Top Gear was voted best programme of the decade in a Channel 4-commissioned survey, The Greatest TV Shows of the Noughties, ahead of The Apprentice and Doctor Who in second and third places respectively. Industry insiders and television pundits voted; also a thousand members of the public took part in a YouGov poll. The results were broadcast on Sunday 27 December 2009 at 9:00 pm, the same time as the Bolivia Special on BBC Two.\\n\\nControversies\\nTop Gear has often been criticised for content inside programmes by some members of the public and by Ofcom. Most of the criticisms stem from comments from the presenting team; however, other aspects of the programme have been underlined as unsuitable. Incidents and content ranging from (but not limited to) remarks considered by some viewers to be offensive, promoting irresponsible driving, ridiculing environmental issues, Germans, Mexicans, and Poles, and alleged homophobia have generated complaints. British comedian and guest of the programme Steve Coogan has criticised the programme, accusing it of lazy, adolescent humour and \"casual racism\".The programme has also been accused of misrepresenting vehicle manufacturer Tesla in an episode first aired in 2008. The firm took Top Gear to court for libel and malicious falsehood after it suggested one of its Roadster vehicles had run out of power after only 55 miles. On 19 October 2011, the High Court of Justice in London rejected Tesla\\'s libel claim, claiming the series is an entertainment programme and not an information programme.Clarkson himself has been critical of the BBC over their handling of the programme. In the February 2006 issue of Top Gear magazine, he voiced his opinion that the BBC did not take Top Gear seriously. He has also commented on his dislike of BBC bosses for choosing the length of the series and for often replacing the programme with snooker (which Clarkson labelled as \"drunk men playing billiards\"), despite Top Gear having considerably higher viewing figures.In March 2014, Indian-born actress Somi Guha made a formal complaint to BBC for $1.8 million, for a racist term used after building a bridge over the Kok River in the Burma Special. Upon its completion, Clarkson said, \"That\\'s a proud moment, but there\\'s a slope on it\", and Richard Hammond added, \"Yeah, right. It\\'s definitely higher on that side\". This led to complaints that \"slope\" is a derogatory term for an Asian person. In April, Top Gear\\'s executive producer Andy Wilman apologised for the racist remark. In July 2014 Ofcom ruled that the BBC had breached broadcasting rules by including this offensive racial term. In May 2014, there were complaints and calls for Clarkson to be sacked after it was revealed that he recited \"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe; catch a nigger by his toe\" as a children\\'s rhyme on an unaired take from the show. Clarkson denied having used the word, then apologised when a previously unbroadcast clip revealed him doing so.Top Gear also received extensive criticism in late October 2014 during filming of an episode for Series 22 in Argentina. The presenters and the associated film crew were chased out of the country by angry protesters allegedly throwing rocks at the team. This was in protest against the number plate, H982 FKL, on Jeremy Clarkson\\'s Porsche 928 GT, which was believed to make reference to the 1982 Falklands War. The BBC maintained that the index number was pure coincidence.The show also received widespread criticism after the sacking of Jeremy Clarkson, and subsequent resignations of James May and Richard Hammond. The criticism continued for the first episode of the following series, hosted by Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc.\\n\\nInternational versions\\nThe popularity of the original UK series eventually led to the creation of a number of international versions, each with local production teams and presenters, all made under licence from BBC Studios:\\n\\nAustralia\\nOn 19 November 2007, it was revealed that a localised Australian series of Top Gear would be produced by the Special Broadcasting Service network in conjunction with Freehand Productions, BBC Worldwide\\'s Australasian partner. This announcement marks the first time a deal has been struck for a version of Top Gear to be produced exclusively for a foreign market. No indication was given as to the exact makeup of the series, other than that it would have a distinctly Australian style. SBS ran a competition to find hosts for the series, and in May 2008 confirmed that the presenters for the Australian programme were to be Charlie Cox, Warren Brown, Steve Pizzati and a local \"cousin\" of the Stig. James Morrison replaced Charlie for the second series of Top Gear Australia. Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson added, \"I\\'m delighted that Top Gear is going to Australia.\" It was announced that the Nine Network had secured the rights to the local and UK versions from 2010 on both its Nine and Go! (digital TV) stations. On 20 June 2010, it was announced that actor and comedian Shane Jacobson and Top Gear Australia magazine editor Ewen Page would join a returning Steve Pizzati to present the programme which premiered on 28 September 2010. The Australian version has received lacklustre reviews. Eventually, Top Gear UK and Top Gear Australia met up and challenged each other. Top Gear Australia was cancelled in September 2011.\\n\\nRussia\\nOn 14 October 2008, the Top Gear website confirmed that a Russian edition of the programme was scheduled for production by the end of that year. Initially, 15 episodes were scheduled. It was revealed on 20 December that the pilot, branded Top Gear: Russian Version, was filmed for broadcast on 22 February 2009. The format is similar to its British counterpart, with three hosts: an ex rock guitarist Nikolai Fomenko, an ex-MTV Russia VJ Oscar Kuchera, and a former automotive journalist Mikhail Petrovsky.After only half of the first series, broadcasting of the Russian version ceased due to viewers\\' criticism. The channel switched to broadcasting the British version of the series from then on.\\n\\nUnited States\\nFirst news of an American version of Top Gear surfaced in January 2006, when the official Top Gear website ran a feature about the filming of an American version of the series, produced by the Discovery Channel. The pilot featured Bruno Massel as one of the hosts, but was not picked up by the network, which later began running edited versions of Series 1–5 of the UK original.\\nIn April 2007, the BBC reported on a Sun story that Top Gear had been in talks about creating an American version. The current presenters would remain as hosts, but the series would focus on American cars and include American celebrities.NBC announced it ordered a pilot episode for an American version of Top Gear, to be produced by BBC Worldwide America. The pilot, filmed in June 2008, was presented by television and radio host Adam Carolla, rally driver Tanner Foust, and television carpenter Eric Stromer. However, following the failure of a car-themed drama, NBC did not place the programme on its schedule, indicating it planned to hold it as a spring/summer (2009) series replacement. Eventually, NBC dropped the series. In a February 2009 appearance in Australia, Jeremy Clarkson commented that the U.S. version of the series had been \"canned\".The series found new life in February 2010, when it was announced that the History cable channel had picked up the series and ordered between 10 and 12 episodes. The series began production in August 2010, with a premiere on 21 November 2010. A trailer was released in early August showing footage of the hosts simulating a \"Moonshine run\". Tanner Foust remained as a host, and was joined by comedian/actor Adam Ferrara and racing analyst Rutledge Wood. The show has now aired 62 episodes across 5 seasons.\\nIn January 2016 a seven part compilation show of racing segments from all 22 UK series, presented by Matt Le Blanc, began airing on BBC America titled Top Gear: The Races.\\n\\nSouth Korea\\nOn 20 August 2011, the first series of the Korean version of Top Gear, produced by the XTM Channel, was aired with 13 episodes. On 8 April 2012, the second series of 10 episodes began.\\nPast presenters are Kim Kap-soo, Jo Min-ki, Park Jun-gyu and Yeon Jung-hoon, with the current presenters being Ryu Si-won, Danny Ahn, and Kim Jin-pyo. The fourth series was launched in April 2013.\\n\\nChina\\nThe first attempt at a Chinese Top Gear was in 2011. Fifteen minutes of the pilot leaked before the airdate but was promptly removed at the BBC\\'s request.In May 2014, BBC announced that it has signed a deal with Honyee Media to produce a local version of Top Gear in China. On 13 November 2014, the first series of the Top Gear China premiered on Shanghai Dragon Television, presented by Cheng Lei, a veteran Chinese TV presenter, Richie Jen, a Taiwanese singer and actor, and Tian Liang, a former Olympic gold-medalist in diving.\\n\\nFrance\\nA French version of Top Gear began in 2015 on RMC Découverte, NextRadioTV\\'s free-to-air channel. It is presented by the actor Philippe Lellouche, the professional driver Bruce Jouanny and Yann Larret-Menezo, an electronic music artist and journalist.Filming was at the end of 2014 and in January 2015 on the aérodrome de Brienne-le-Château near Troyes.The first series consists of 10 episodes including three made of highlights of the series.The first episode, broadcast on 18 March 2015 at 20:45, broke RMC Découverte\\'s audience record with 966,000 viewers (3.6% audience share).\\n\\nItaly\\nThere is also an Italian version of Top Gear, from 22 March to 26 April 2016. The show was broadcast on Sky Uno and Sky Sport Mix, and was hosted by Joe Bastianich, Guido Meda, Davide Valsecchi and The Stig. The Italian version was similar to the UK version.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nTop Gear at BBC Programmes Top Gear at TV.com\\nTop Gear at BBC Online\\nTop Gear at IMDb\\nTop Gear magazine UK website\\nTop Gear on BBC America\\nBBC News article on Top Gear\\'s history (21 September 2006)\\nList of Cars appearing on Top Gear courtesy of IMCDb\\nNeedcoffee.com post and BBC Worldwide America press release regarding the American version (15 January 2008)\\nTop Gear on UKTV\\nWorld of Top Gear at National Motor Museum, Beaulieu',\n",
              " 'Top Gun': 'Top Gun is a 1986 American action drama film directed by Tony Scott, and produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, in association with Paramount Pictures. The screenplay was written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in California magazine three years earlier. The film stars Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer, Anthony Edwards, and Tom Skerritt. Cruise plays Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young naval aviator aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. He and his Radar Intercept Officer, LTJG Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy\\'s Fighter Weapons School at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California.\\nTop Gun was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent. Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing US$356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an IMAX 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the film won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Take My Breath Away\" performed by Berlin.\\nIn 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A sequel, titled Top Gun: Maverick was originally scheduled for release on June 26, 2020, which was postponed to December 23, 2020, then to July 2, 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nPlot\\nUnited States Naval Aviator LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) LTJG Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw are stationed aboard the USS Enterprise, from which they fly the F-14A Tomcat. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft, Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick\\'s wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his wings, citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick\\'s recklessness, CAG \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose to attend TOPGUN, the Naval Fighter Weapons School at Naval Air Station Miramar.\\nAt a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. Maverick learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an astrophysicist and civilian TOPGUN instructor. Charlie later becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft\\'s performance.\\nDuring Maverick\\'s first training hop he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks a major rule of engagement and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Privately, Jester confides that he admires Maverick\\'s skill, but does not know if he would trust him as a teammate in combat. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, who considers Maverick\\'s attitude \"foolish\" and his flying \"dangerous\"—as Maverick\\'s tendency to abandon his team and pursue reckless objectives makes him \"unsafe\" to fly with. In class, Charlie also objects to Maverick\\'s aggressive tactics but privately admits to him that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\\nDuring another training hop (Hop 19), Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper. Viper admits he is impressed with his flying abilities but Maverick is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Jester publicly tells Maverick that his flying is excellent, but that he should \"never leave [his] wingman\".\\nMaverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the TOPGUN Trophy, chase an A-4 in a later training engagement (Hop 31). Since part of the scoring in every flight in the course is the time taken for every dogfight to conclude, and after noticing that Iceman is pulling time during his chase after the A-4 so that his total score in the course will remain higher than Maverick\\'s, Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement with the A-4 they are both chasing so that he can shoot it down himself, but Maverick\\'s F-14 flies through the jet wash of Iceman\\'s aircraft and suffers a flameout of both engines, going into an unrecoverable flat spin.  Maverick and Goose eject, but Goose hits the jettisoned aircraft canopy head-first and is killed.\\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose\\'s death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick\\'s father Duke Mitchell on the USS Oriskany and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the TOPGUN Trophy.\\nDuring the graduation party, Viper and Jester call in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to the Enterprise to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.\\nMaverick and Merlin (Cougar\\'s former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman\\'s reservations over Maverick\\'s state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a catapult failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose\\'s death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, the two are still badly outnumbered, but Maverick vocally refuses to leave Iceman without a wingman and manages to shoot down three MiGs. Iceman, shifting to offense, also shoots one down, which forces the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to Enterprise, Iceman and Maverick share newfound respect in each other, and Maverick throws Goose\\'s dog tags overboard.\\nOffered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to TOPGUN as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nBackground\\nThe primary inspiration for the film was the article \"Top Guns\" by Ehud Yonay, from the May 1983 issue of California magazine, which featured aerial photography by then-Lieutenant Commander Charles \"Heater\" Heatley. The article detailed the life of fighter pilots at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, self-nicknamed as \"Fightertown USA\". Numerous screenwriters allegedly turned down the project. Bruckheimer and Simpson went on to hire Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., to write the first draft. The research methods, by Epps, included attendance at several declassified Topgun classes at Miramar and gaining experience by being flown in an F-14. The first draft failed to impress Bruckheimer and Simpson, and is considered to be very different from the final product in numerous ways. Tony Scott was hired to direct on the strength of a commercial he had done for Swedish automaker Saab in the early 1980s, where a Saab 900 turbo is shown racing a Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet.Actor Matthew Modine turned down the role of Pete Mitchell (that went to Tom Cruise) because he felt the film\\'s pro-military stance went against his politics. The character of Chipper Piper was created just for Pasdar as Scott loved his performance.The producers wanted the assistance of the US Navy in the production of the film. The Navy was influential in relation to script approval, which resulted in changes being made. The opening dogfight was moved to international waters as opposed to Cuba, the language was toned down, and a scene that involved a crash on the deck of an aircraft carrier was also scrapped. Maverick\\'s love interest was also changed from a female enlisted member of the Navy to a civilian contractor with the Navy, due to the US military\\'s prohibition of fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel. The \"Charlie\" character also replaced an aerobics instructor from an early draft as a love interest for Maverick after producers were introduced to Christine \"Legs\" Fox, a civilian mathematician employed by the Center for Naval Analyses as a specialist in Maritime Air Superiority (MAS), developing tactics for aircraft carrier defense.Julianne Phillips was in consideration for the role of Charlie, and had been scheduled to perform a screen test opposite Tom Cruise.Rear Admiral Pete \"Viper\" Pettigrew, a former Navy aviator, Vietnam War veteran, and Topgun instructor served as a technical advisor on the film, and also made a cameo appearance in the film as a colleague of Charlie\\'s.\\nFormer Top Gun instructor pilot and Congressman Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham claimed to have been the inspiration for Pete Mitchell, although the film\\'s producers have denied that the character was based on any specific Naval Aviator.\\n\\nFilming\\nThe Navy made several aircraft from F-14 fighter squadron VF-51 \"Screaming Eagles\" (which Tom Skerritt mentions in the scene at his home) available for the film. Paramount paid as much as US$7,800 per hour (equivalent to $18,500 today) for fuel and other operating costs whenever aircraft were flown outside their normal duties. Shots of the aircraft carrier sequences were filmed aboard USS Enterprise, showing aircraft from F-14 squadrons VF-114 \"Aardvarks\" and VF-213 \"Black Lions\". The majority of the carrier flight deck shots were of normal aircraft operations and the film crew had to take what they could get, save for the occasional flyby which the film crew would request. During filming, director Tony Scott wanted to shoot aircraft landing and taking off, back-lit by the sun. During one particular filming sequence, the ship\\'s commanding officer changed the ship\\'s course, thus changing the light. When Scott asked if they could continue on their previous course and speed, he was informed by the commander that it cost US$25,000 (equivalent to $59,000 today) to turn the ship, and to continue on course. Scott wrote the carrier\\'s captain a US$25,000 check so that the ship could be turned and he could continue shooting for another five minutes.\\n\\nFuture NASA astronaut Scott Altman piloted F-14 aircraft for many of the film\\'s stunt sequences, having been recently stationed at NAS Miramar at time of filming. Altman was the pilot seen \"flipping the bird\" in the film\\'s well-known opening sequence, as well as piloting the aircraft shown \"buzzing the tower\" throughout the film. Most of the sequences of the aircraft maneuvering over land were shot at Naval Air Station Fallon, in Nevada, using ground-mounted cameras. Air-to-air shots were filmed using a Learjet, piloted by Astrovision inventor and legendary pilot Clay Lacy. His name is misspelled in the closing credits, as Clay Lacey. Grumman, manufacturer of the F-14, was commissioned by Paramount Pictures to create camera pods to be placed upon the aircraft that could be pointed toward either the front or rear of the aircraft providing outside shots at high altitude.In July 1985, Kansas City Barbeque served as a filming location for two scenes. The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"Great Balls of Fire\" while seated at the piano. The final scene, where \"You\\'ve Lost That Lovin\\' Feelin\\'\" can be heard on the restaurant\\'s jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008.Renowned aerobatic pilot Art Scholl was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a flat spin, which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his Pitts Special biplane into the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast near Carlsbad on September 16, 1985. Neither Scholl\\'s body nor his aircraft was recovered, leaving the official cause of the accident unknown. Top Gun was dedicated to Scholl\\'s memory.The film was shot in the Super 35 format, as anamorphic lenses were too large to fit inside the cockpits of the fighter jets.Reshoots after Top Gun\\'s filming wrapped conflicted with Made in Heaven, in which McGillis starred with brown hair. Top Gun\\'s filmmakers were forced to hide her hair color, which for example resulted a scene shot in an elevator that featured McGillis in a baseball cap.\\n\\nMusic\\nThe Top Gun soundtrack is one of the most popular soundtracks to date, reaching 9× Platinum certification and No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 200 albums chart for five nonconsecutive weeks in the summer and fall of 1986. Harold Faltermeyer, who previously worked with both Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson on Beverly Hills Cop, was sent the script of Top Gun by Bruckheimer before filming began. Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock worked on numerous songs including the Oscar-winning \"Take My Breath Away\". Kenny Loggins performed two songs on the soundtrack, \"Playing with the Boys\", and \"Danger Zone\". Berlin recorded the song \"Take My Breath Away\", which would later win numerous awards, sending the band to international acclaim. After the release of Loggins\\'s single \"Danger Zone\", sales of the album exploded, selling 7 million in the United States alone. On the re-release of the soundtrack in 2000, two songs that had been omitted from the original album (and had been released many years before the film was made), \"Great Balls of Fire\" by Jerry Lee Lewis and \"You\\'ve Lost That Lovin\\' Feelin\\'\" by The Righteous Brothers, were added. The soundtrack also includes \"Top Gun Anthem\" and \"Memories\" by Steve Stevens/Faltermeyer and Faltermeyer.\\nOther artists were considered for the soundtrack project but did not participate. Bryan Adams was considered as a potential candidate but refused to participate because he felt the film glorified war. The band Toto was originally meant to record \"Danger Zone\", and had also written and recorded a song \"Only You\" for the soundtrack. However, there was a dispute between Toto\\'s lawyers and the producers of the film, paving the way for Loggins to record \"Danger Zone\" and \"Only You\" being omitted from the film entirely.\\n\\nRelease\\nTheatrical\\nThe film\\'s premiere was held in New York City on May 12, 1986 with another held in San Diego on May 15.The film opened in the United States in 1,028 theaters on May 16, 1986.\\n\\nHome media\\nIn addition to its box office success, Top Gun went on to break further records in the then still-developing home video market. It was the first new-release blockbuster on video cassette to be priced as low as $26.95 and, backed by a massive $8 million marketing campaign, including a Top Gun-themed Diet Pepsi commercial, the advance demand was such that the film became the best-selling videocassette in the industry\\'s history on pre-orders alone, with over 1.9 million units ordered before its launch on March 10, 1987. It eventually sold a record 2.9 million units.The film was first released in the U.S. on DVD under Paramount Pictures on October 21, 1998 and included the film in both Widescreen (non-anamorphic Univisium 2.00:1) and Full Screen (open matte) versions. Top Gun\\'s home video success was again reflected by strong DVD sales, which were furthered by a Special Collector\\'s Edition 2-disc DVD release on December 14, 2004 in both Widescreen (anamorphic 2.39:1) and Full Screen (open matte) versions, that include new bonus features. Special features comprise audio commentary by Bruckheimer, Tony Scott and naval experts, four music videos including the \"Top Gun Anthem\" and \"Take My Breath Away\", a six-part documentary on the making of Top Gun, and vintage gallery with interviews, behind-the-scenes and survival training featurettes.Subsequently, the film was first released on Blu-ray disc on July 29, 2008 with the same supplemental features as the Collector\\'s Edition DVD and also as a 2-disc limited edition 3D copy on February 19, 2013. The remastered Blu-ray and Digital Copy version of the film was released on May 19, 2019 on Paramount Movies.\\nTop Gun was released in the U.S. on remastered Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD on May 19, 2020 with two new special features titled The Legacy of Top Gun and On Your Six: Thirty Years of Top Gun, with the remaining bonus features being ported over.\\n\\nIMAX 3D re-release\\nTop Gun was re-released in IMAX 3D on February 8, 2013, for six days. A four-minute preview of the conversion, featuring the \"Danger Zone\" flight sequence, was screened at the 2012 International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nThe film quickly became a success and was the highest-grossing film of 1986. It would be six months before its theater count dropped below that of its opening week. It was number one on its first weekend with a gross of US$8,193,052, and went on to a total domestic gross of US$176,781,728. Internationally it took in an estimated US$177,030,000 for a worldwide box office total of US$353,811,728. The film sold an estimated 47,650,100 tickets in North America in its initial theatrical run.The film grossed an additional US$3,018,873 in its IMAX re-release in 2013 bringing its domestic gross to US$179,800,601 and its worldwide gross to US$356,830,601.\\n\\nCritical response\\nUpon the film\\'s original release, critical response was mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 55% based on reviews from 55 critics, with an average rating of 5.85/10. The website\\'s critical consensus states: \"Though it features some of the most memorable and electrifying aerial footage shot with an expert eye for action, Top Gun offers too little for non-adolescent viewers to chew on when its characters aren\\'t in the air.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying that \"Movies like Top Gun are hard to review because the good parts are so good and the bad parts are so relentless. The dogfights are absolutely the best since Clint Eastwood\\'s electrifying aerial scenes in Firefox. But look out for the scenes where the people talk to one another.\"\\n\\nAwards\\nThe film was nominated for and won many awards, most prominently for its sound and effects.

In 2005, the line \"I feel the need... the need for speed!\" was ranked 94 on AFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list.\\n\\nAmerican Film Institute listAFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:\\n\"I feel the need — the need for speed.\" – #94\\n\\nEffect on military recruiting\\nMovie producer John Davis said that Top Gun was a recruiting video for the Navy, that people saw the movie and said, \"Wow! I want to be a pilot.\" The Navy had recruitment booths in some theaters to attract enthusiastic patrons. After the film\\'s release, the US Navy stated that the number of young men who joined wanting to be Naval Aviators went up by 500 percent.\\n\\nChinese government plagiarism\\nOn January 23, 2011, China\\'s state broadcaster China Central Television published a TV news story about the alleged efficiency of Chinese fighter pilots which incorporated footage from the Top Gun action sequences. Chinese internet users noticed the plagiarism, whereupon the broadcast was immediately withdrawn. Ironically, this occurred shortly after the initiation of a Chinese campaign to purge such forged reports; CCTV has declined comments on this incident.\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nBomber jacket sales increased and Ray-Ban Aviator sunglasses jumped 40%, due to their use by characters in the film.The 1991 film Hot Shots! was a comedy spoof of Top Gun.The masculine theme of the film has been the subject of humorous examination, with the homoerotic subtext examined in a monologue performed by Quentin Tarantino in the 1994 film Sleep with Me.Top Gun is one of many war and action films, especially those by Jerry Bruckheimer, parodied in the 2004 comedy Team America: World Police.Top Gun along with A Few Good Men are recognized for being an inspiration for the TV series JAG and the subsequent NCIS franchise in turn. JAG and NCIS are also owned by Paramount.The DisneyToon Studios film Planes (2013), pays homage to Top Gun with Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards appearing in the film as part of the voice cast.Two propaganda Chinese films, 2011\\'s Jian Shi Chu Ji (\"Skyfighters\") and 2017\\'s Kong Tian Lie (\"Sky Hunter\"), were based on Top Gun.\\n\\nSequel\\nA sequel has been in active development since at least 2010.  However plans were complicated by Scott\\'s death in 2012. In 2013 Bruckheimer said, \"For 30 years we\\'ve been trying to make a sequel and we\\'re not going to stop. We still want to do it with Tom and Paramount are still interested in making it. What Tom tells me is that no matter where he goes in the world, people refer to him as Maverick. It\\'s something he is excited about so as long as he keeps his enthusiasm hopefully we\\'ll get it made.\"By September 2014 it was revealed that Justin Marks was in negotiations to write the screenplay, which was confirmed that following June. Marks would go on later to say that the film was a dream project for him, calling the original an \"iconic film in my memory\" due in part to it being one of the first films he remembers seeing in a movie theater.In May 2017, during the promotional tour for The Mummy, Cruise confirmed that a sequel to Top Gun will start filming in 2018. By June of the same year, he said that the title will be Top Gun: Maverick with Faltermeyer back as composer for the sequel. Cruise further stated that, \"Aviators are back, the need for speed. We\\'re going to have big, fast machines. It\\'s going to be a competition film, like the first one...but a progression for Maverick.\" Later that month it was announced Joseph Kosinski, who directed Cruise in 2013\\'s Oblivion, was set to direct the sequel.A trailer was released   at ComicCon International on July 18, 2019.The release date has been pushed back several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The current release date is July 2, 2021.\\n\\nVideo games\\nTop Gun also spawned a number of video games for various platforms. The original game was released in 1986 under the same title as the film. It was released on Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST. Another game, also titled Top Gun, was released in 1987 for Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Nintendo VS. System arcade cabinets. In the 1987 game, the player pilots an F-14 Tomcat fighter, and has to complete four missions. A sequel, Top Gun: The Second Mission, was released for the NES three years later.\\nAnother game, Top Gun: Fire at Will, was released in 1996 for the PC and later for the Sony PlayStation platform. Top Gun: Hornet\\'s Nest was released in 1998. Top Gun: Combat Zones was released for PlayStation 2 in 2001 and was subsequently released for the GameCube and Microsoft Windows.

Peter Craig, Justin Marks, who described the film as a dream project, Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz would be credited as screenwriters on the project.\\nWhen asked about his idea for a new Top Gun film, Scott replied, \"This world fascinated me, because it\\'s so different from what it was originally. But I don\\'t want to do a remake. I don\\'t want to do a reinvention. I want to do a new movie.\" The film will reportedly focus on the end of the dogfighting era and the role of drones in modern aerial warfare and that Cruise\\'s character, Maverick, will fly an F/A-18 Super Hornet. After Scott\\'s suicide, the sequel\\'s future remained in question, but producer Jerry Bruckheimer remained committed to the project, especially given Cruise\\'s and Kilmer\\'s interest.In June 2017, Cruise revealed that the title would be Top Gun: Maverick, with Harold Faltermeyer returning as composer for the sequel. Cruise further stated that, \"Aviators are back, the need for speed. We\\'re going to have big, fast machines.

In July 2020, the film was once again delayed to July 2, 2021, partially due to scheduling conflicts with Cruise, as well as the recent delays of Mulan and Tenet due to the rise of COVID-19 cases. Netflix and Apple TV+ have reportedly tried to purchase the distribution rights to the film, but Paramount has refused to sell them. It will later be streamed on Paramount+, 45 days after its theatrical release.\\n\\nSee also\\nList of films featuring drones\\nList of films released in IMAX\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nTop Gun: Maverick at IMDb',\n",
              " 'Tropic Thunder': 'Tropic Thunder is a 2008 satirical action comedy film directed by Ben Stiller. It stars Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Jay Baruchel, and Brandon T. Jackson as a group of prima donna actors making a Vietnam War film. When their frustrated director (played by Steve Coogan) drops them in the middle of a jungle, they are forced to rely on their acting skills to survive the real action and danger. It is a parody of  many famous war films, specifically those based on the Vietnam War. \\nThe film features an ensemble cast that includes Tom Cruise, Nick Nolte, Matthew McConaughey and Bill Hader. The screenplay was written by Justin Theroux, Stiller, and Etan Cohen from a story by Stiller and Theroux. The film was produced by Stuart Cornfeld, Stiller, and Eric McLeod for Red Hour Productions and DreamWorks Pictures as an international co-production between the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom.\\nStiller\\'s idea for the film originated while playing a minor role in Empire of the Sun, and he later enlisted Theroux and Cohen to help complete the script. After the film was green-lit in 2006, filming took place in 2007 on the Hawaiian island of Kaua\\'i over thirteen weeks and was later deemed the largest film production in the island\\'s history. The film had an extensive marketing promotion, including faux websites for the three main characters and their fictional films, airing a fictional television special, and selling the energy drink advertised in the film, \"Booty Sweat\".\\nThe film received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the film\\'s characters, story, faux trailers, and the performances of Stiller, Downey, Black and Cruise. However, the film\\'s depiction of the mentally handicapped received significant controversy. The film\\'s soundtrack and score debuted on August 5, 2008, before the film\\'s theatrical release. Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks released the film in the US on August 13, 2008. In its North American opening weekend, the film earned $26 million and retained the number one position for the first three weekends of release. Downey was nominated for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award, with both him and Cruise receiving nominations for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. The film grossed more than $188 million worldwide before its release on home video on November 18, 2008.\\n\\nPlot\\nHook-handed Vietnam veteran Staff Sergeant John \"Four Leaf\" Tayback\\'s memoir Tropic Thunder is being made into a film. With the exception of newcomer supporting actor Kevin Sandusky, the cast—fading action hero Tugg Speedman, five-time Academy Award-winning Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus, rapper Alpa Chino, and drug-addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy—all cause problems for director Damien Cockburn, who cannot control them, resulting in a million-dollar pyrotechnics scene being wasted. The project is months behind schedule. Studio executive Les Grossman orders Damien to get the cast under control or risk the project\\'s cancellation.\\nOn Four Leaf\\'s advice, Damien drops the actors into the middle of the jungle, with hidden cameras and rigged special effects explosions to film \"guerrilla-style\". The actors have guns that fire blanks, along with a map and scene listing that will lead to a helicopter waiting at the end of the route. Unknown to the actors and production, the group have been dropped in the middle of the Golden Triangle, the home of the heroin-producing Flaming Dragon gang. Just as the group is about to set off, Damien inadvertently steps on an old land mine and is blown up, stunning the actors. Tugg, believing Damien faked his death to encourage the cast to give better performances, assures the others that Damien is alive, and that they are still shooting the film. Kirk is unconvinced but joins them in their trek through the jungle.\\nWhen Four Leaf and pyrotechnics operator Cody Underwood try to locate the deceased director, they are captured by Flaming Dragon. Four Leaf is revealed to have hands; he confesses to Underwood that he actually served in the Coast Guard, has never left the United States, and that he wrote his \"memoir\" as a tribute. As the actors continue through the jungle, Kirk and Kevin discover that Tugg is leading them in the wrong direction. The resulting argument results in Kirk leading the rest of the cast back toward the resort they are staying at as an increasingly delirious Tugg is captured by Flaming Dragon. Taken to their base, Tugg believes it is a POW camp from the script. The gang discovers he is the star of their favorite film, the box-office bomb Simple Jack, and force him to reenact it several times a day.\\nMeanwhile, in Los Angeles, Tugg\\'s agent Rick \\'Pecker\\' Peck confronts Les over an unfulfilled term in Tugg\\'s contract that entitles him to a TiVo. Flaming Dragon calls during the discussion and demands a ransom for Tugg, but Les instead delivers a profanity-laden death threat. Les is uninterested in rescuing Tugg and is instead delighted at the prospect of a large insurance payout if Tugg dies. He attempts to convince Pecker to play along by promising a Gulfstream V jet and \"lots of money\".\\nKirk, Alpa, Jeff, and Kevin discover Flaming Dragon\\'s heroin factory. After witnessing Tugg being tortured, they plan a rescue attempt based on the film\\'s script. Kirk impersonates a farmer towing a \"captured\" Jeff on the back of a water buffalo, distracting the armed guards so Alpa and Kevin can infiltrate and find the prisoners, but a combination of broken Chinese and inconsistencies in his story sets off the gang\\'s boss. The actors, knowing their cover has been blown, begin firing, fooling gang members into surrender. Their control of the gang falls apart when Jeff grabs the leader and heads for the drugs, and the gang, realizing the guns fire blanks, recover their guns and fight back.\\nThe four actors locate Four Leaf, Cody, and Tugg and cross a bridge rigged to explode to get to Underwood\\'s helicopter. Tugg initially remains behind, believing Flaming Dragon to be his \"family\", but runs back screaming, chased by an angry horde. Four Leaf destroys the bridge, rescuing Tugg, but as the helicopter takes off, the gang boss fires a rocket-propelled grenade at the helicopter. Rick unexpectedly stumbles out of the jungle and saves them by throwing a TiVo box into the path of the grenade. The crew return to Hollywood and footage from the hidden cameras is compiled into the feature film Tropic Blunder, which becomes a major critical and commercial success. The film wins Tugg his first Academy Award, which Kirk presents to him at the ceremony.\\n\\nCast\\nBen Stiller as Tugg Speedman: Once the highest-paid, highest-grossing action film star ever due to his Scorcher franchise, his career has stalled, and he now has a reputation for appearing in nothing but box office bombs. After drawing negative coverage for his portrayal in Simple Jack, in which he plays a mentally-challenged farm boy, he takes the role of Four Leaf Tayback in an attempt to save his career. Tugg\\'s faux trailer at the film\\'s start is a preview for Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown, the latest in his series and a spoof of long-running summer action blockbuster franchises.\\nJack Black as Jeff Portnoy: A drug-addicted comedian-actor well known for portraying multiple parts in films that rely on toilet humor, particularly jokes about flatulence. In the film-within-a-film, he plays a raspy-voiced soldier named Fats. He fears he is only considered an actor because of his farts and nothing else. Portnoy\\'s faux trailer for juvenile family comedy The Fatties: Fart 2, about a family (with each member played by Portnoy) which enjoys passing gas, spoofs Eddie Murphy\\'s portrayal of multiple characters in films such as Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.\\nRobert Downey Jr. as Kirk Lazarus: An Australian method actor and five-time Academy Award winner, Lazarus had a controversial \"pigmentation alteration\" surgery to darken his skin for his portrayal of the black character, Staff Sergeant Lincoln Osiris. Lazarus refuses to break character until he has recorded the DVD commentary for a part and only speaks in his character\\'s African American Vernacular English. Lazarus\\'s faux trailer, Satan\\'s Alley, is about two gay monks in a 12th-century Irish monastery, parodying films like Brokeback Mountain and Downey\\'s own scenes with Tobey Maguire (who in a cameo portrays himself playing the other monk) in Wonder Boys. Downey said he modeled Lazarus on three actors: Russell Crowe, Daniel Day-Lewis and Colin Farrell. Lazarus was originally intended to be Irish, but Downey felt more comfortable using an Australian accent, since he had portrayed an Australian character in Natural Born Killers.\\nNick Nolte as Four Leaf Tayback: The author of Tropic Thunder, a fake memoir of his war experiences on which the film-within-a-film is based. He suggests the idea of dropping the actors in the middle of the jungle to get them looking and feeling like soldiers lost in a foreign land.\\nSteve Coogan as Damien Cockburn: The inexperienced British film director who is unable to control the actors in the film. The character was partly inspired by Richard Stanley, and his experience of directing the 1996 film The Island of Dr. Moreau, with Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando.\\nJay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky: A novice actor, he is the only cast member to have read the script and book and attended the assigned boot camp prior to the film. Sandusky plays a young soldier named Brooklyn in the film-within-a-film. Brooklyn and Sandusky each occupy the position of straight man in character in the film-within-a-film and its cast, being the only actor without an internal conflict or deep-seated insecurity. He often serves as a mediator when tensions between the cast get high.\\nDanny McBride as Cody: The film\\'s explosives expert and helicopter pilot. He is a pyromaniac.\\nBrandon T. Jackson as Alpa Chino: A closeted homosexual rapper who is attempting to cross over into acting, portraying a soldier named Motown, while promoting his \"Bust-A-Nut\" candy bar and \"Booty Sweat\" energy drink. He feels his image as a rapper would not allow him to be openly gay. His name is a play on Al Pacino. Kevin Hart turned down the role because he did not want to play a gay character.\\nBill Hader as Studio Executive Rob Slolom: Grossman\\'s assistant and right-hand man.\\nBrandon Soo Hoo as Tran: The 12-year-old young leader of the Flaming Dragon gang. The character was compared to God\\'s Army guerrilla leaders Johnny and Luther Htoo.\\nReggie Lee as Byong: The second-in-command of the Flaming Dragon gang.\\nTrieu Tran as Tru: A dedicated soldier, and actor, in the Flaming Dragon gang.\\nMatthew McConaughey as Rick \"The Pecker\" Peck: Speedman\\'s extremely devoted agent and best friend.\\nTom Cruise as Les Grossman: The profane, ill-tempered studio executive producing Tropic Thunder.Various actors and celebrities portray themselves, including Tobey Maguire, Tyra Banks, Maria Menounos, Martin Lawrence, The Mooney Suzuki, Jason Bateman, Lance Bass, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Alicia Silverstone, Christine Taylor, Mini Anden, Anthony Ruivivar, Rachel Avery, Yvette Nicole Brown, Sean Penn, and Jon Voight. Co-writer Justin Theroux appears in two brief roles as a UH-1 Huey gunner and the disc jockey from Zoolander (shown in a deleted scene).\\n\\nProduction\\nScript\\nStiller developed the premise for Tropic Thunder while shooting Empire of the Sun, in which he played a small part. Stiller wanted to make a film based on the actors he knew who, after taking part in boot camps to prepare for war film roles, became \"self-important\" and \"self-involved\" and appeared to believe they had been part of a real military unit.Co-writer Theroux revealed that the initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with posttraumatic stress disorder. The final script was developed to satirize Vietnam War films such as Apocalypse Now, Rambo, Missing in Action, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, and The Deer Hunter. Theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of the inner workings of Hollywood due to celebrity websites and Hollywood news sources, the script was easier to write. Dialogue for unscripted portions of the storyboard was developed on set by the actors or was improvised.\\n\\nCasting\\nEtan Cohen created the role of Kirk Lazarus as a way of lampooning the great lengths that some method actors go to depict a role. Downey was approached by Stiller about the part while on vacation in Hawaii. Downey said on CBS\\' The Early Show that his first reaction was, \"This is the stupidest idea I\\'ve ever heard!\" and that Stiller responded, \"Yeah, I know – isn\\'t it great?\" In another interview, Downey said that he accepted the part but, having no idea where or even how to start building the character of Lazarus, eventually settled on a jive-esque speech pattern and a ragged bass voice; he then auditioned Lazarus\\' voice over the phone to Stiller, who approved the characterization immediately. Downey revealed that he modeled the character on actors Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, and Daniel Day-Lewis. The initial script was written for Downey\\'s character to be Irish, but was altered after Downey stated he could improvise better as an Australian (he had previously played a similar outlandish Australian character in the film Natural Born Killers). Downey\\'s practice of remaining in character between takes and even off the film set was also written into the script for his character to perform. Downey required between one and a half to two hours of make-up application. According to Downey, \"One makeup artist would start on one side of my face and a second makeup artist would start on the other side, and then they\\'d meet in the middle.\"Downey acknowledged the potential controversy over his role: \"At the end of the day, it\\'s always about how well you commit to the character. If I didn\\'t feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I\\'m just C. Thomas Howell [in Soul Man], I would\\'ve stayed home.\" Co-star Brandon T. Jackson stated: \"When I first read the script, I was like: What? Blackface? But when I saw him [act] he, like, became a black man ... It was just good acting. It was weird on the set because he would keep going with the character. He\\'s a method actor.\" Stiller commented on Downey\\'s portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: \"When people see the movie – in the context of the film, he\\'s playing a method actor who\\'s gone to great lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously.\" Stiller previewed the film before the NAACP, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.\\n\\nCruise was initially set to cameo as Stiller\\'s character\\'s agent, Rick Peck. Instead, Cruise suggested adding a studio head character, and the idea was incorporated into the script. Stiller and Cruise worked together to create the new character, Les Grossman, as a middle-aged businessman. The role required that Cruise don a fatsuit, large prosthetic hands, and a bald cap. It was Cruise\\'s idea to give the character large hands and dance to \"Low\". Stiller intended to keep Cruise\\'s role a secret until the film\\'s release. In addition, Paramount Pictures refused to release promotional pictures of Cruise\\'s character to the media. In November 2007, images of Cruise wearing a bald headpiece and a fatsuit appeared on Inside Edition, as well as on the Internet. Cruise\\'s attorneys threatened a lawsuit if photos showing Cruise in costume were published. They approached various sites that were hosting the image and quickly had it removed. A representative for Cruise stated: \"Mr. Cruise\\'s appearance was supposed to be a surprise for his fans worldwide. Paparazzi have ruined what should have been a fun discovery for moviegoers.\" The photography agency INF, who debuted the image, responded with a statement: \"While these pictures were taken without breaking any criminal or civil laws, we\\'ve decided to pull them from circulation effective immediately.\"Serving as a last-minute replacement, Tobey Maguire was only available to be on set for two hours to film his scenes in Satan\\'s Alley. Downey said he was amazed Maguire would agree to do the film and felt like they were creating a \"karmic pay-off\" for their scenes together in the 2000 film Wonder Boys, where Downey\\'s character has a one-night stand with Maguire\\'s character. After Cruise vacated the role of Rick Peck, Owen Wilson was cast to play the part. Following his suicide attempt in August 2007, Wilson dropped out of the film and was replaced by Matthew McConaughey.\\n\\nFilming\\nAlthough Southern California and Mexico were considered for the main unit filming, the Hawaiian island of Kaua\\'i (where Stiller has a home) was selected for the majority of the shooting. Kaua\\'i was chosen over Mexico because a tax credit for in-state spending was negotiated with the Kaua\\'i Film Commission. John Toll, the cinematographer, stated the island was also selected for its similarity to Vietnam, based on its dense foliage, variety of terrains, and weather. Kaua\\'i was first scouted as a possible location to film Tropic Thunder in 2004. Stiller spent more than 25 hours over 6 weeks exploring the island, using all-terrain vehicles, boats, and helicopters. After the film was greenlit by DreamWorks in 2006, pre-production lasted for six months, most of this time spent on scouting additional locations for filming. Filming for the Los Angeles and interior scenes occurred on sets at Universal Studios in Hollywood.\\n\\nTropic Thunder was the first major studio production on Kaua\\'i in five years. After filming was completed, it was deemed the largest production filmed on the island to date, and contributed more than $60 million to the local economy. Tim Ryan, the executive editor of Hawaii Film & Video Magazine, commented on the filming on the island: \"I think Tropic Thunder will give Kaua\\'i much needed and long idled publicity in the production arena ... It should put Kaua\\'i back on the production consideration radar.\" Preliminary production crews were on the island starting in December 2006 and principal photography began in July 2007, with filming lasting thirteen weeks over seven separate locations on the island. Much of the filming took place on private land as well as conservation status designated areas. Casting calls on the island sought 500 residents to portray the villagers in the film. Two units shot simultaneously on the island from the ground, and an aerial unit shot from helicopters. Many of the sets and the bridge used for one of the final scenes were built in three months. The island\\'s erratic weather hampered filming with rain and lighting issues. The crew also faced complications in moving the equipment and cast due to the difficult terrain.The film advising company Warriors Inc. was enlisted to ensure the war scenes, including the attire worn by the actors, looked authentic. Former members of the U.S. military taught the actors how to handle, fire, and reload their weapons, as well as perform various tactical movements. The opening war scene was filmed over three weeks and required fifty stuntmen. Animatics were used to map out the necessary camera angles for filming.\\n\\nEffects\\nSix companies working on different scenes and elements created 500 shots of visual effects in the film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: \"We worked really hard to make the CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, but at the same time he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben\\'s sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade ... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that ... But it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool ... and feels kind of real.\"Filming the large napalm explosion in the opening scene of the film required a 450-foot (137-meter) row of explosive pots containing 1,100 gallons (4,165 liters) of gasoline and diesel fuel. All the palm trees used in the explosion were moved to the specific location after the crew determined the impact of the lighting and necessary camera angles. Due to the size and cost of the 1.25-second explosion, it was only performed once and was captured by twelve cameras. For the safety of the crew and cast, the detonators were added one hour before the explosion and nobody was allowed to be within 400 feet (120 m) during detonation. The explosion was made up of twelve individual explosions and resulted in a mushroom cloud that reached 350 feet (110 m) in the air. For the scene in the film, Danny McBride\\'s character, Cody Underwood, was the only actor shown in the shot of the explosion. All the other characters were added digitally. The explosion of the bridge in one of the final scenes used nine cameras to capture the shot, and the crew was required to be 3,000 feet (910 m) away for their safety.\\n\\nPromotion\\nA trailer for the film was released in April 2008. The Calgary Herald gave it a rating of 3/5, commenting: \"This could either be good or very, very bad.\" Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly questioned whether the film would \"... turn into precisely the kind of bloated action monstrosity that it\\'s making fun of.\" The trailer received the \"Best Comedy Trailer\" award at the 9th annual Golden Trailer Awards. DreamWorks also released a red band trailer, the first of its kind used by the studio to promote one of its films.Stiller, Downey, and Black appeared on the seventh-season finale of American Idol in a sketch as The Pips performing with Gladys Knight (via archival footage). The three actors also later performed a sketch at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards which featured the actors attempting to create a successful viral video to promote the film with awkward results. In September 2008, Stiller and Downey attended the San Sebastián International Film Festival to promote the film. A screening was shown, but it was not chosen to compete against the other films at the festival.Between April 2008 and the film\\'s commercial release in August 2008, the film had over 250 promotional screenings. On August 3, 2008, Stiller, Downey, and Black visited Camp Pendleton, a U.S. Marine Corps base in California, to present a screening to over a thousand military members and their families. The screening was on behalf of the United Service Organizations and included the actors heading to the screening by helicopter and Humvees. On August 8, 2008, a special 30-minute fictional E! True Hollywood Story aired about the making of Tropic Thunder. In video games, a themed scavenger hunt was incorporated into Tom Clancy\\'s Rainbow Six: Vegas 2, and Stiller allowed his likeness to be used in the online Facebook application game based on the film.As a tie-in for the film\\'s release, Paramount announced it would market the energy drink known in the film as \"Booty Sweat\". Michael Corcoran, Paramount\\'s president of consumer products, commented on the release: \"We\\'re very excited, because it has the potential to live for quite a while, well beyond the film.\" The drink was sold in college bookstores, on Amazon.com, and at other retailers.\\n\\nFaux websites and mockumentary\\nSeveral faux websites were created for the main characters and some of their prior film roles. A website for Simple Jack, a faux film exhibited within the film, was removed by DreamWorks on August 4, due to protests from disability advocates. In addition, other promotional websites were created for \"Make Pretty Skin Clinic\", the fictitious company that performed the surgery of the film\\'s character Kirk Lazarus, along with one for the energy drink \"Booty Sweat\".\\nIn mid-July 2008, a faux trailer for the mockumentary Rain of Madness was released. The mockumentary was a parody of Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker\\'s Apocalypse. It follows co-writer Justin Theroux as a fictitious documentarian named Jan Jürgen documenting the behind-the-scenes aspects of the film within the film. Marketing for the faux documentary included a movie poster and an official website prior to Tropic Thunder\\'s release. The mockumentary was released on the iTunes Store after the film\\'s release and was also included on the home video release. Amy Powell, an advertising executive with Paramount, reflected on the timing of the release of Madness: \"We always thought that people would be talking about Tropic Thunder at the water cooler, and that\\'s why we decided to release Rain of Madness two weeks into Tropic\\'s run—to keep this positive buzz going.\"\\n\\nRelease\\nTheatrical release\\nTropic Thunder held an early screening at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, two weeks before it officially premiered on August 11, 2008, at the Mann Village Theatre in Westwood, California and two days before its wide release. Members of several disability groups picketed before the premiere, protesting at the portrayal of intellectual disability shown in the film. The groups revealed that it was the first time that they had ever protested together at an event. As a result of the protest, the normally unobstructed views of the red carpet leading to the premiere were blocked off by 10-foot (3-m)-high fences and there was an increase in the number of security personnel present. No protests were held at the United Kingdom\\'s September premiere.The North American release was scheduled for July 11, 2008, but was delayed until August 15, before being brought forward to August 13. As a result of the move from July, 20th Century Fox moved its family comedy Meet Dave in the open slot. The August 13 release date was also the opening weekends for the animated family film Star Wars: The Clone Wars and the horror film Mirrors. Studios consider the third week of August to be a weaker performing period than earlier in the summer because of students returning to school. Previous R-rated comedies such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Superbad were released in mid-August and performed well at the box office. Reacting to Tropic Thunder\\'s release date, Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, stated: \"For a young person at the end of summer, you want to have some fun and forget about going back to school. What better than a crazy comedy?\"\\n\\nHome media\\nTropic Thunder was released in the United States on DVD and Blu-ray on November 18, 2008, three months after its release and a week after the end of its theatrical run in the U.S. and Canada. The film was released on home video on January 26, 2009 in the United Kingdom. Special features include an unrated director\\'s cut of the film which is 12 minutes longer than the theatrical release, audio commentaries (including one featuring Stiller, Downey, and Black, with Downey providing his commentary as Lincoln Osiris, a nod to a joke in the film that Lazarus never breaks character until he completes the DVD commentary), several featurettes, deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and the Rain of Madness mockumentary.For the film\\'s first week of release, Tropic Thunder placed on several video charts. It reached second place on the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert sales chart and Nielsen\\'s Blu-ray Disc chart, earning $19,064,959 (not including Blu-ray sales). In rentals, it placed first on the Home Media Magazine\\'s video rental chart. The DVD sales in 2008 totaled $42,271,059, placing it in 28th for DVD sales for the year. By September 2009, 2,963,000 DVD units have been sold, gathering revenue of $49,870,248.\\n\\nReception\\nCritical response\\nThe review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 82% based on 249 reviews and an average rating of 7.12/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"With biting satire, plenty of subversive humor, and an unforgettable turn by Robert Downey Jr., Tropic Thunder is a triumphant late summer comedy.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score from reviews by mainstream critics, gave a film score of 71 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".After attending an industry screening in April 2008 Michael Cieply from The New York Times stated that the film was \"... shaping up as one of [DreamWorks]\\'s best prospects for the summer.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film a positive review, writing \"There are some wildly funny scenes, a few leaden ones and others that are scattershot, with humorous satire undercut by over-the-top grisliness. Still, when it\\'s funny, it\\'s really funny.\" A review in Variety by Todd McCarthy was critical: \"Apart from startling, out-there comic turns by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise, however, the antics here are pretty thin, redundant and one-note.\" Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail gave the film a negative review, calling it \"... an assault in the guise of a comedy—watching it is like getting mugged by a clown.\" J.R. Jones of Chicago Reader stated \"The rest of the movie never lives up to the hilarity of the opening, partly because the large-scale production smothers the gags but mostly because those gags are so easy to smother.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave 3.5/4 and wrote, \"The movie is, may I say, considerably better than Stiller’s previous film, Zoolander (2001). It’s the kind of summer comedy that rolls in, makes a lot of people laugh and rolls on to video.\"The faux trailers before the film also received mixed reviews. David Ansen of Newsweek approved of the trailers, writing \"Tropic Thunder is the funniest movie of the summer—so funny, in fact, that you start laughing before the film itself has begun.\" Christy Lemire, writing for the Associated Press, called the trailers \"... the best part of the trip.\" Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice was critical, saying that the trailers\\' comedy \"... resides in the land of the obvious, easy chuckle.\"Downey, Stiller, Black and Cruise were repeatedly singled out for praise by numerous critics, claiming that they \"stole the show\", were \"... off-the-charts hilarious ...\", and would bring viewers \"... the fondest memories of [their] work.\" Scott Feinberg, of the Los Angeles Times, criticized the concept of Downey\\'s portrayal of an African-American, writing \"... I just can\\'t imagine any circumstance under which a blackface performance would be acceptable, any more than I can imagine any circumstance under which the use of the N-word would be acceptable.\" Sara Vilkomerson said Cruise did \"... an astonishingly funny and surprising supporting performance.\" Logan Hill of New York argued against Cruise\\'s cameo saying that it \"... just makes him look a little lost and almost pathetic—shucking and jiving, trying to appeal to the younger moviegoers who are abandoning him.\"Several critics commented on the controversy over lines in the film talking about the mentally disabled. Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote that the film \"... is just sophomoric enough to offend. And while it is also funny, it is without the empathy or compassion to cause us to wonder why we are laughing.\" Christian Toto of The Washington Times argued against the opposition, \"Tropic Thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for ... its frequent use of the word \\'retard\\', but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted. And they\\'ll be laughing too hard to take offense.\" Kurt Loder of MTV contrasted the opposition to the lines with Downey character portrayal of an African American, \"The scene in which the derisive Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) nails Lazarus\\' recitation of black-uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the Jeffersons theme is funny; but the one in which Lazarus quietly explains to Speedman that his Simple Jack character failed because he made the mistake of going \\'full retard\\'—rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of Forrest Gump—is so on-the-nose accurate, it takes your breath away.\"\\n\\nCritics\\' lists\\nIn January 2009, Entertainment Weekly included Tropic Thunder in its list \"25 Great Comedies From the Past 25 Years\" for its \"spot-on skewering of Hollywood.\" The film also appeared on several critics\\' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. Stephen King placed it at the fourth position, calling the film \"the funniest, most daring comedy of the year.\" The Oregonian\\'s Marc Mohan, placed it sixth, and several critics placed it seventh: Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News, Premiere magazine, Mike Russell of The Oregonian, as well as Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle. David Ansen of Newsweek placed it eighth and Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly included the film in the tenth position.\\n\\nBox office\\nStacey Snider, the chief executive of DreamWorks, suggested that the film would earn around $30 million in its opening weekend and go on to be as successful as Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, which earned $129 million in the U.S. and Canada and $260 million worldwide. The Dark Knight had been the number one film at the box office for the four weeks prior to the release of Tropic Thunder. Bob Thompson, a writer for the National Post, speculated that Tropic Thunder\\'s opening weekend would outperform The Dark Knight for the weekend. In a list compiled prior to the summer\\'s film releases, Entertainment Weekly predicted that the film would be the tenth highest-grossing film of the summer at the American box office with $142.6 million.Tropic Thunder opened in 3,319 theaters and, for its first five days of American and Canadian release, earned $36,845,588. The film placed first in the weekend\\'s box office with $25,812,796, surpassing Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Mirrors, which debuted the same weekend. Reacting to the film\\'s opening receipts, DreamWorks spokesman Chip Sullivan stated \"We\\'re thrilled, quite frankly. It played out exactly how we hoped.\" In foreign markets for the film\\'s opening weekend, it was released in 418 Russian and 19 United Arab Emirates locations earning $2.2 million and $319,000, respectively.The film maintained its number one position at the American and Canadian box office for the following two weekends, making it the second film in 2008 (after The Dark Knight) to hold the number-one position for more than two consecutive weekends. The film\\'s widest release was in 3,473 theaters, placing it in the top 25 widest releases in the U.S. for 2008. For 2008, the film was the fifth-highest-grossing domestic R-rated film. The film\\'s U.S. and Canada gross of over $110 million made Tropic Thunder Stiller\\'s most successful film as a director. The film has had gross receipts of $110,515,313 in the U.S. and Canada and $77,557,336 in international markets for a total of $188,072,649 worldwide.\\n\\nAccolades\\nIn October 2008, Paramount chose to put end-of-year award push funds behind Tropic Thunder, and began advertising for Downey to receive a nomination by the Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor. In a November 2008 issue by Entertainment Weekly, Downey\\'s film role was considered one of the three contenders for Best Supporting Actor. As a way of extending the film-within-a-film \"universe\" into real life, there have also been at least two online \"For Your Consideration\" ads touting Downey\\'s character, Kirk Lazarus, for Best Supporting Actor; one of these contains \"scenes\" from Satan\\'s Alley that were not in the trailer as released in theaters. At least one of the ads was produced by Paramount Pictures and intended for early For Your Consideration awareness for Downey\\'s role. On January 22, 2009, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated Downey for Best Supporting Actor. At the 81st Academy Awards, Downey lost to Heath Ledger for his role as The Joker in The Dark Knight.With the onset of the annual Hollywood film award season at the end of 2008, Tropic Thunder began receiving nominations and awards starting with a win for \"Hollywood Comedy of the Year Award\" at the 12th annual Hollywood Film Festival on October 27, 2008. The film was nominated for Best Motion Picture, Comedy or Musical, for the Satellite Awards. In addition, Downey was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The Broadcast Film Critics Association nominated Downey for Best Supporting Actor and awarded Tropic Thunder Best Comedy Movie at the BFCA\\'s Critics\\' Choice Awards. Both Downey and Cruise received nominations from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for Golden Globes for Best Supporting Actor. The Boston Society of Film Critics recognized the cast with its Best Ensemble award. Downey was also nominated by both the Screen Actors Guild and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts for Best Supporting Actor awards.\\n\\nControversy\\nTropic Thunder was criticized by the disability advocacy community. The website for Simple Jack was withdrawn on August 4 amid several groups\\' concerns over its portrayal of intellectual disability. A spokesman for DreamWorks said, \"We heard their concerns, and we understand that taken out of context, the site appeared to be insensitive to people with disabilities.\" A coalition of more than 20 disability advocacy groups, including the Special Olympics and the Arc of the United States, objected to the film\\'s repeated use of the word \"retard\". DreamWorks offered to screen the film for the groups on August 8 to determine if it still offended them. The screening was postponed to the same day of the premiere on August 11. After representatives for the groups attended the private screening and were offended by its content, the groups picketed outside the film\\'s premiere. Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics, stated, \"This population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against Hollywood. We\\'re sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable.\"Disability advocates and others who previewed the film reported that the offensive treatment of individuals with mental disabilities was woven throughout the film\\'s plot. Disability advocates urged people not to see the film, claiming it is demeaning to individuals with mental disabilities and would encourage bullying. Stiller defended the film, stating \"We screened the movie so many times and this didn\\'t come up until very late ... in the context of the film I think it\\'s really clear, they were making fun of the actors and actors who try to use serious subjects to win awards.\" Co-writer Etan Cohen echoed Stiller\\'s rationale: \"Some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people, but we\\'re really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim.\" He went on to state that the film lampoons actors who portray intellectually disabled or autistic characters such as Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, and Sean Penn in I Am Sam. A DreamWorks spokesman did not directly respond to the criticism, claiming that Tropic Thunder \"... is an R-rated comedy that satirizes Hollywood and its excesses, makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over-the-top characters in ridiculous situations.\" The film\\'s advertising was altered, but none of the scenes in the film were edited as a result of the opposition. In response to the controversy, the director\\'s cut of the DVD (but not the Blu-ray) includes a public service announcement in the special features that discourages use of the word \"retard\".\\n\\nMusic\\nTropic Thunder\\'s score and soundtrack were released on August 5, 2008, the week before the film\\'s theatrical release. The score was composed by Theodore Shapiro and performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony. William Ruhlmann of allmusic gave the score a positive review, stating it is \"...an affectionate and knowing satire of the history of Hollywood action movie music, penned by an insider.\" Thomas Simpson of SoundtrackNet called it \"...a mixture of fun, seriousness, rock n\\' roll and great scoring.\"Five songs, \"Cum On Feel the Noize\" by Quiet Riot, \"Sympathy for the Devil\" by The Rolling Stones, \"For What It\\'s Worth\" by Buffalo Springfield, \"Low\" by Flo Rida and T-Pain, and \"Get Back\" by Ludacris, were not present on the soundtrack, yet did appear in the film. The soundtrack features songs from The Temptations, MC Hammer, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Edwin Starr, and other artists. The single \"Name of the Game\" by The Crystal Method featuring Ryu has an exclusive remix on the soundtrack. The soundtrack debuted 20th on Billboard\\'s Top Soundtracks list and peaked at 39th on its Top Independent Albums list. James Christopher Monger of allmusic compared the music to other film\\'s soundtracks such as Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and Forrest Gump and called it \"...a fun but slight listen that plays out like an old late-\\'70s K-Tel compilation with a few bonus cuts from the future.\"\\n\\nSpin-off\\nCruise reprised his character Les Grossman for the 2010 MTV Movie Awards. On June 9, 2010, it was announced that a spin-off film would be developed centering on Grossman. A script has been written by Michael Bacall. In March 2012, Bacall gave an update on the long-rumored Les Grossman spin-off movie, revealing that the film will attempt to uncover where Grossman\\'s well-documented anger issues originated.\\n\\nSee also\\nList of films featuring fictional films\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nTropic Thunder at IMDb\\nTropic Thunder at Box Office Mojo\\nTropic Thunder at Rotten Tomatoes\\nTropic Thunder at AllMovie\\nTropic Thunder at Metacritic',\n",
              " 'Valkyrie (film)': 'Valkyrie is a 2008 thriller film directed and co-produced by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander. The film is set in Nazi Germany during World War II and depicts the 20 July plot in 1944 by German army officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler and to use the Operation Valkyrie national emergency plan to take control of the country. The film was released by American studio United Artists and  stars Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, one of the key plotters. The cast includes Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Eddie Izzard, Terence Stamp, and Tom Wilkinson. \\nCruise\\'s casting caused controversy among German politicians and members of the von Stauffenberg family due to the actor\\'s practice of Scientology, which is viewed with suspicion in Germany. Because of this, the filmmakers initially had difficulty setting up filming locations in Germany, but they were later given access to locations such as Berlin\\'s historic Bendlerblock. German newspapers and filmmakers supported the film and its intention to spread global awareness of von Stauffenberg\\'s plot.\\nThe film changed release dates several times, from as early as June 27, 2008, to as late as February 14, 2009. The changing calendar and poor response to United Artists\\'s initial marketing campaign drew criticism about the film\\'s viability. After a positive test screening, Valkyrie\\'s release in North America was ultimately changed to December 25, 2008. United Artists renewed its marketing campaign to reduce its focus on Cruise and to highlight Singer\\'s credentials. The film received mixed reviews in the United States and in Germany, where it opened commercially on January 22, 2009.\\n\\nPlot\\nDuring World War II, Wehrmacht Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is stationed in Tunisia, where he becomes increasingly disillusioned with the future of Germany under Hitler\\'s tyranny. His battalion comes under attack by P-40 fighter-bombers of the No. 3 Squadron RAAF, Desert Air Force. Stauffenberg is severely injured in the air raid and is evacuated home to Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, Hitler visits his military headquarters on the Eastern Front. General Henning von Tresckow attempts to assassinate Hitler by smuggling a timebomb disguised as a box of Cointreau onto his plane. The bomb fails to detonate, and Hitler\\'s plane lands safely in Berlin. Shortly afterwards resistance member General Hans Oster is arrested by the Gestapo. While recuperating, Stauffenberg is recruited by General Friedrich Olbricht to take Oster\\'s place in the German Resistance, which includes Tresckow, General Ludwig Beck, Dr. Carl Goerdeler, and Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben.\\nStauffenberg proposes using Operation Valkyrie, which involves the deployment of the Reserve Army in a national emergency, as a means to take control of the country. The plotters redraft the plan\\'s orders to dismantle the Nazi regime after assassinating Hitler. Stauffenberg\\'s new role within the Reserve Army grants him direct access to Hitler, who approves the redrafted plan without fully examining the modifications. Realizing that only General Friedrich Fromm, the head of the Reserve Army, can initiate Valkyrie, they offer him a position as head of the Wehrmacht, but Fromm declines to be directly involved.\\nStauffenberg is ordered to assassinate both Hitler and Himmler at the Wolf\\'s Lair. He persuades General Fellgiebel to cut off communications after the attempt. On July 15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at the Wolf\\'s Lair with a bomb, but does not receive permission to proceed as Himmler is absent. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht. Stauffenberg leaves with the bomb and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down. Fromm threatens Olbricht and Stauffenberg that he will arrest them if they try to control the Reserve Army again; Stauffenberg berates the plotters for their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler. When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved, Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest, and that he must leave the country immediately.\\nOn July 20, 1944, Stauffenberg and his adjutant Lieutenant Haeften return to the Wolf\\'s Lair. Due to the warm weather, the conference is being held in an open-window summer barrack, minimizing their bomb\\'s potential effectiveness. Stauffenberg places the briefcase containing the bomb close to Hitler before leaving. Officer Heinz Brandt moves the case behind a table leg, inadvertently shielding Hitler. When the bomb explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees, managing to bluff his way past security checkpoints and returning to Berlin.\\nOlbricht refuses to mobilize the Reserve Army without confirmation that Hitler is dead – Colonel Von Quirnheim (one of the plotters) forges his signature and issues the orders. With Valkyrie underway, the plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup, and soldiers begin to take control of the ministries. Rumors surface that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Having learned from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive, Fromm refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him. \\nMajor Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler. Recognizing the voice on the other end, Remer realizes that the Reserve Army has been duped. SS officers are released and the plotters are besieged inside the Bendlerblock. The headquarters staff flees, but the resistance leaders are arrested. Attempting to save himself, Fromm convenes an impromptu court martial, places Beck under arrest, and sentences Von Quirnheim, Olbricht, Haeften, and Stauffenberg to death. The ringleaders are executed by firing squad, Beck is given a pistol and commits suicide and Tresckow commits suicide in a forest by holding a grenade to his throat, Witzleben and Goerdeler are sentenced by Roland Freisler in show trials and hanged.\\nA post-script displays the text of the German resistance memorial.\\n\\nCast\\nTom Cruise as Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, the German army Colonel who was instrumental in the conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler: Bryan Singer saw von Stauffenberg as \"very much a humanist\", saying, \"He understood his role as a colonel, but he also understood that the Nazis were doing terrible, terrible, terrible things.\" Having directed Superman Returns, Singer compared von Stauffenberg\\'s dual identity as loyal colonel and conspirator to Superman and his civilian identity Clark Kent. Cruise had wanted to work with Singer since they met at the premiere for Mission: Impossible, and the actor was enticed by the script\\'s background, the truth of which struck him as a surprise. The actor described von Stauffenberg\\'s heroism: \"I thought of it in terms of what [von] Stauffenberg represents. He was someone who realized that he had to take the steps that ultimately cost him his life. ... He recognized what was at stake.\" Cruise felt von Stauffenberg did not think of himself as a hero. The actor prepared for the role for eight months by hiring a researcher, studying history books, and speaking with some of von Stauffenberg\\'s family. Since von Stauffenberg lost his left eye, right hand and two fingers on his left hand in an Allied attack in Tunisia, Cruise affected the same disabilities to practice dressing, moving items and writing. Cruise initially found the eyepatch difficult to work with but acknowledged that von Stauffenberg had to live with this discomfort.\\nKenneth Branagh as Major General Henning von Tresckow: Branagh differed physically from the real von Tresckow, who was balding, but Singer said, \"[I]f you look at [von] Tresckow\\'s energy, he had an honesty that Branagh has.\"\\nBill Nighy as General of Infantry Friedrich Olbricht: Nighy was cast to give a sympathetic quality, so Olbricht would not be the \"fall guy\". Nighy wanted to convey Olbricht as conflicted between complaining about Hitler\\'s regime and actually doing something about it. The actor described his portrayal, \"One of the most disconcerting things imaginable is to put on a Nazi uniform. It\\'s so associated with evil that it took me several days to get used to being in costume.\"\\nTerence Stamp as Generaloberst Ludwig Beck: Singer met Stamp to discuss playing a part in X-Men, having admired him for portraying General Zod in Superman II. Stamp endured the Blitz as a child and aided Singer in staging a scene where the von Stauffenbergs hide from Allied bombings. The actor described his approach to acting: he was not the sort of actor who puts on a mask; rather, he tries to find the place within himself that resonates with the characters he portrays saying that \"[t]here has to be a kind of non-judgmental discernment, so when I\\'m playing villains, they don\\'t think they\\'re particularly villains.\" Singer said of his direction of Stamp as the heroic and selfless Beck that he sought to find \"the part of Terence that would be prepared to fall on his sword for certain ideals\" just as Beck had in fact done after being arrested with his co-conspirators for treason.\\nTom Wilkinson as General Friedrich Fromm, the head of Germany\\'s Reserve Army: Wilkinson was cast to make the treacherous Fromm sympathetic.\\nCarice van Houten as Nina Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, von Stauffenberg\\'s wife: The filmmakers were impressed by her performance in Black Book, and argued she could give a strong performance with minimal dialogue. Screenwriter Nathan Alexander spoke to von Stauffenberg\\'s relatives and noted that, although Nina and Claus never directly spoke about the plot, \"in a sense it was all they talked about\".\\nKevin McNally as Dr. Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, a German politician who intended to become chancellor of Germany after a successful coup\\nDavid Schofield as Generalfeldmarschall Erwin von Witzleben, a retired general and one of the plotters: Singer and producer Christopher McQuarrie were impressed by Schofield\\'s professionalism and dedication to show up on set for scenes without his character, and the filmmakers expanded his role as a result.\\nChristian Berkel as Colonel Albrecht Ritter Mertz von Quirnheim, a plotter with knowledge of explosives\\nJamie Parker as Lieutenant Werner von Haeften, an adjutant to von Stauffenberg who helps the colonel carry out the plot\\nEddie Izzard as General of Signal Corps Erich Fellgiebel, a German signals officer and plotter, responsible for communications at Hitler\\'s bunker Wolf\\'s Lair\\nDavid Bamber as Adolf Hitler, the Führer of Germany: During Bamber\\'s audition for the role, Singer was struck by Bamber\\'s eyes and stated that Bamber had a quality that resonated with Hitler.\\nThomas Kretschmann as Major Otto Ernst Remer, commanding officer of Großdeutschland guard battalion: Kretschmann was the original choice to play von Stauffenberg before Singer joined the production, when McQuarrie was intending to direct.\\nHarvey Friedman as Dr. Joseph Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda and a member of Hitler\\'s inner circle\\nKenneth Cranham as Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, the head of the OKW and a member of Hitler\\'s inner circle\\nMatthias Freihof as Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS and a member of Hitler\\'s inner circle\\nWaldemar Kobus as Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf, chief of the Berlin police who pledges his and men\\'s assistance in carrying out the plot\\nHalina Reijn as Margarethe von Oven, secretary in the Bendlerblock: Reijn co-starred with fellow Dutchwoman Carice van Houten in Black Book.\\nWerner Daehn as Major Ernst John von Freyend\\nTom Hollander as Colonel Heinz Brandt\\nBernard Hill as a general working with von Stauffenberg during the Tunisian campaign: While he is not named in the film, the 10th Panzer Division\\'s commander while von Stauffenberg was serving with it was General Friedrich Freiherr von Broich.\\nIan McNeice as the composite \"Pompous General\" who attempts to disrupt the coup headquarters: Though the general is not named in the film, McQuarrie and Alexander said the character was based on General Joachim von Kortzfleisch, who tried to disrupt the coup in the same fashion.\\nGerhard Haase-Hindenberg as Hermann Göring\\nAnton Algrang as Albert Speer\\nHelmut Stauss as judge Roland Freisler\\nMatthew Burton as Lieutenant General Adolf Heusinger\\nPhilipp von Schulthess as Major General Henning von Tresckow\\'s aide: The actor is the grandson of Claus von Stauffenberg.\\nChris Larkin as Sergeant HelmPatrick Wilson was originally cast in Valkyrie, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts and other unspecified reasons. Stephen Fry was also offered a role in the film but was unable to participate.Some of the non-German actors initially experimented with German accents, but Singer discarded the idea, instead instructing them to adopt neutral accents that \"[wouldn\\'t] distract from the story\". Singer added he was not making a docu-drama and wanted to make the story engaging.\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nIn 2002, Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching another project and visited the memorial to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock. Researching the 20 July plot, he was moved and fascinated by the fact that the conspirators were fully aware of what would happen if they failed their assassination attempt, and he wanted to make their story more well-known. He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began researching the project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution. (Branagh, McNally and McNeice had all starred in Conspiracy.) He also sought to direct the film, until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing.After Singer completed the three major productions X-Men (2000), X2 (2003) and Superman Returns (2006), he sought a smaller project before embarking upon the eventually aborted sequel to Superman Returns. Singer and McQuarrie had often made World War II films in their backyards while growing up in New Jersey, and Singer had later dealt with Nazi subject matter in Apt Pupil and X-Men. Singer first learned of the plot in the early 1980s when his mother visited Bonn and met Freya von Moltke, widow of Helmuth von Moltke, a founder of the Kreisau Circle resistance group. After learning of McQuarrie and Alexander\\'s screenplay and signing on to direct Valkyrie, Singer read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer to gain deeper understanding of Nazi Germany\\'s political landscape, and also met with one of Hitler\\'s bodyguards, Rochus Misch, who was the last person to leave the bunker where Hitler committed suicide. The creative team acknowledged the ambiguity over the enigmatic von Stauffenberg\\'s true motivation, but Singer and McQuarrie judged him to be a man of ethics just from what he did. Though McQuarrie sought for Valkyrie to be similar to Conspiracy, Singer had bigger ambitions for the film, wanting it to be more than \"old men in rooms, talking\". Singer looked back on his decision, saying, \"The true story had all the makings of a classic assassination thriller. ... I knew if I could keep the audience with [von] Stauffenberg, with his mission, they would go with the flow and be less inclined to start hypothesising on things from history.\"McQuarrie suggested they bring the project to United Artists partners Paula Wagner and Tom Cruise, who immediately agreed to finance the film in March 2007. Singer invited Tom Cruise to take the lead role, which Cruise accepted. Cruise had been provided a picture of von Stauffenberg, in which the actor noticed a similarity in his profile with the German colonel, drawing him to the role. The director and the screenwriter initially anticipated Valkyrie as a \"small\" film with a budget of under US$20 million and to be completed within several months, but Cruise\\'s interest in playing von Stauffenberg made Singer realize his involvement could broaden the film\\'s publicity and therefore its budget. The film\\'s budget was then raised to $60 million. The director considered calling the film Operation Valkyrie, not wanting to use a generic action film title. The film\\'s English-language title was ultimately titled Valkyrie because Singer felt that the film was about more than the operation and liked its connection to Wagner\\'s music.\\n\\nGermany\\'s Finance Ministry had originally denied the producers the right to film at Bendlerblock, explaining that the site should be treated as a \"place of remembrance and mourning\" which would \"lose dignity if we were to exploit it as a film set\". The producers were also denied a request to film at a Berlin police station by the department, citing adverse impact to the facility. The German government eventually had a change of heart concerning the Bendlerblock site and gave permission for filmmakers to film there. A United Artists spokesman said that they were \"very grateful\" for the decision, saying that the site \"[had] always been important to us symbolically, creatively and for the sake of historical authenticity\" and that the company had been in continuous talks with the German government in order to clear up any misconceptions about the nature of the film. The Memorial to the German Resistance also helped filmmakers by permitting them access to their materials and documents. German military pageantry was shaped by referring to the recorded material and input from military advisers.\\n\\nWriting\\nMcQuarrie and Alexander researched first-hand accounts, photos, newsreels and texts. They also examined Gestapo and SS records, as the organizations had been meticulous in reconstructing the events of the conspiracy in its aftermath. A timeline of events was created, from which McQuarrie and Alexander shaped the script. After production began in Berlin, the writers were able to visit locations and meet with relatives of the conspirators; these meetings informed changes made to the script during filming.The initial scenes of von Stauffenberg in Tunisia were written to provide historical context to the rest of the film. The scenes were written with the intention of communicating the complexity of the situation—including references to the Holocaust—without being too obvious. The writers also wanted to evoke the spirit of the resistance and convey the ongoing disgust of the German officers. McQuarrie and Alexander found the most difficult task was in conveying the motives of the conspirators; von Stauffenberg especially remained an enigma, though the writers believed he and the other resistance members to be propelled by their moral outrage. McQuarrie and Alexander attempted to include a scene of von Stauffenberg\\'s witnessing an atrocity, but because he was a supply officer he had little exposure to many of those that occurred. Though he witnessed some—such as the starvation of the Russians—they believed it difficult to dramatize von Stauffenberg\\'s being compelled to action by \"field reports\". They also had difficulties with Hitler\\'s portrayal; in researching his speeches, they struggled to find one in which he made overtly villainous statements.\\n\\nFilming\\nFilming began on July 18, 2007, in Berlin. Production of Valkyrie was then estimated to have a budget of US$80 million, with two-thirds to be spent in Germany. The German Federal Film Fund issued €4.8 million (US$6.64 million) to United Artists to assist with production. The filmmakers received permission to film at Tempelhof International Airport\\'s Columbia Haus, a former Nazi jail for political prisoners. Production also involved World War II planes with swastikas painted on the sides, practicing in the airspace above Brandenburg. Around 70 sets were built for the film. The filmmakers also shot on location at the former Reich Air Ministry Building and the exterior of the house at which von Stauffenberg stayed with his brother.A replica set of Hitler\\'s Eastern Front Headquarters Wolf\\'s Lair was constructed 60 kilometers (37 mi) south of Berlin, though the headquarters\\' actual location was in modern-day northeastern Poland. It took twelve weeks to build. Filming took place in some of the houses that were used to hide the bombs in 1944. The interior of Hitler\\'s Bavarian residence Berghof was replicated using film shot by Hitler\\'s consort Eva Braun and designing models of furniture possessed by secretive collectors. The production also made use of surviving Nazi relics, including furniture used by the Reich Air Ministry and objects that once adorned Hitler\\'s desk. Nazi symbols, the display of which is heavily restricted in Germany, were used at several locations; while the filmmakers gave forewarning to local residents, a passerby witnessing the use of swastikas during filming in Berlin filed an official complaint with the city. Similar charges were filed against the owners of sites set up to show Nazi displays for the film\\'s production. Filming also took place at Babelsberg Studios. During filming on August 19, 2007, eleven people were hurt when the side panel of a truck they were riding broke, with one person requiring hospitalization. They demanded $11 million in compensation, rejecting a settlement offered by the studio.Before filming the scene of von Stauffenberg\\'s execution at Bendlerblock, Tom Cruise led the cast and crew in holding a moment of silence \"out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there\", according to actor Christian Berkel. After filming of the scene was completed, the footage was sent to be developed for the post-production process at a processing plant in Germany. The wrong chemical was accidentally used in development, damaging the film and requiring the crew to seek permission from the government to re-shoot the scenes. Permission was granted and a spokesman for the film indicated the schedule and budget had not been affected.Singer and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel chose different styles for the separate halves of the film. Elegant camerawork such as cranes were used for the build-up to the attempt on Hitler\\'s life, while the second half is frantic with handheld cinematography as the plotters are hunted down. The colors in the film also become more intense as the story continues. Sigel focused on red, the color of the Nazi flag, which he felt represented the violence of their ideology. Singer looked towards thrillers of the 1940s and home movies shot by Eva Braun for inspiration. Shooting scenes at night was difficult because presenting the era accurately required blackouts. Sigel noted that, in real life, car headlights were used for the firing squad to aim at and execute the plotters in the Bendlerblock. Singer chose to shoot in 1:85 aspect ratio and, since filming took place in Germany, the director used Arriflex cameras with Zeiss lenses.The Tunisia battle sequence that opened the film was the last major sequence filmed. The filmmakers wanted to avoid the appearance that von Stauffenberg wanted to kill Hitler because of the injuries he suffered in the battle. They began a rough cut in October 2007 and, between then and June 2008, there were several test screenings without the battle sequence. By June 2008, the filmmakers felt that they knew how to adequately frame the characters when filming the battle sequence. Singer scouted Jordan and Spain for locations, but the candidates did not meet the aesthetic and economic criteria. The Cougar Buttes desert in California was ultimately chosen to represent Tunisia. Since the production budget was adjusted to provide visual effects to make von Stauffenberg\\'s injuries realistic, not enough was left for solely computer-generated fighter planes. Singer instead used two P-40 Warhawks in the battle sequence. The budget increased in the course of production due to the filming in Germany, the rebuilding of sets, and lost shooting days, but German tax rebates tempered the growth. The studio reported its final production budget to be $75 million, but competing studios believed it to be closer to $90 million.\\n\\nVisual effects\\nThe film\\'s visual effects were created by Sony Pictures Imageworks, who collaborated with Bryan Singer on Superman Returns. The company\\'s two key goals were to accurately portray von Stauffenberg\\'s injuries and to create a 1943 period look to Berlin. With many explosions and stunts seen in the film performed practically, the majority of the 800 computer-generated effects shots were used to portray von Stauffenberg\\'s injuries. A digital version of Cruise\\'s hand was designed, and technicians rotoscoped the hand in every movement it could make so the missing fingers were erased in the process. With many close-ups of von Stauffenberg\\'s hand with missing fingers, the injuries were textured to look like actual scars, particularly based on surgical procedures from 1943. Cruise asked for advice on how to best move his hands so visual effects would be easier to apply, but some challenges, such as von Stauffenberg getting dressed on his own, were inescapable. According to supervisor Richard R. Hoover, \"We know from historical accounts that von Stauffenberg didn\\'t stick his hands in his pockets to try and hide his injuries.\"For the battle sequence in North Africa, two real Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks in Desert Air Force paint schemes were used, accompanied by cloned images of them or by computer-generated planes. In scenes showing squadrons of soldiers, digital extras were not used; instead, photography of real squadrons was cloned. Sony Pictures Imageworks also digitally expanded details on stage locations and at practical locations. The exterior of Hitler\\'s Bavarian residence Berghof was digitally created, since little was left of the original structure, and the creation was superimposed on a shot of a ski area in Austria. In Berlin itself, city officials helped reduce the need for visual effects by removing power poles and modern lighting over the weekend when filming took place and restoring the equipment by the start of the new week.There was widespread questioning in some corners of the press as to whether, in order to make himself look more muscular and of ample girth, Cruise had employed butt pads during filming. The star eventually addressed and denied the suppositions.\\n\\nEditing and scoring\\nAs with his previous collaborations with Bryan Singer on The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if the film was working well without music, it was becoming a strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title cards were removed due to complaints that there were too many characters to follow.Ottman said the challenge on Valkyrie was to create tension from dialogue scenes, and he often reshaped scenes to do this: moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but he was able to choose what lines and close-ups he could focus on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete, because he had been looking forward to scoring it, was one where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife .Ottman originally planned to compose a minimal score to Valkyrie, but found that despite the film\\'s dialogue-heavy nature, the film needed music to create a thriller atmosphere. Ottman described the new approach, \"It\\'s very much like Usual Suspects—in order to keep the tension going in a scene where there\\'s really a lot of dialogue, we had to rely on a lot of score. But the score is done in a very sort of pulsating, subliminal way. It\\'s not an expository score, it\\'s more like a running pulse going through the movie.\" Singer applied an imaginary metronome, \"which only began clicking\" when he watched scenes where the pace was becoming faster. He had a specific theme he wanted for the film, which was more modern than \"The Winds of War\"-type score he expected Ottman to do. Another challenge in composing thriller music was that the score needed to \"slowly lapse\" into the tragedy of the film\\'s ending. The finished score has some percussion instruments and few brass, but no snare drums or trumpets, which were the conventions Singer and Ottman avoided.Ottman had to compose music for the North African battle before the scene was shot, because booking space to record film music is difficult. Although he found that composing music based on the script results in overlong pieces, he felt the music worked out fine for the sequence. The film\\'s end credits piece, \"They\\'ll Remember You\", is an original composition, but the lyrics were based on the poem \"Wanderer\\'s Nightsong\" by German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. An end piece entitled \"Long Live Sacred Germany\" was inspired by Adagio for Strings, in the sense it would not feel like film music tailored to every moment in the scene, but still fit with what was going on. Ottman described the original version of the track as a \"three minute drone that I slowed down with these two Tuvan throat singers, the whole thing was this horribly dark, morbid piece [which] left you cold\". Ottman composed a metallic motif for Hitler, which was formed by low strings and a piano cluster.\\n\\nGerman response to production\\nIn June 2007, prior to production, a German Defence Ministry spokesperson said that filming of Valkyrie would not be allowed at the country\\'s military sites if protagonist Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg was portrayed by Tom Cruise, due to the actor\\'s adherence to Scientology, which is considered a dangerous cult by the German authorities. The spokesperson further indicated that the ministry had not at that time received official filming requests from Valkyrie\\'s producers. Colonel Stauffenberg\\'s eldest child, retired Bundeswehr general Berthold Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, also voiced concerns over Cruise\\'s portrayal of his father, saying that he would not oppose the film\\'s production, but hoped that Cruise would drop the role. \"I fear that only terrible kitsch will come out of the project. It\\'s bound to be rubbish,\" he said. \"Cruise should keep his hands off my father.\" Later in the month, the ministry reversed its stance and welcomed production of Valkyrie.\\nThe initial controversy reportedly stemmed from German member of parliament Antje Blumenthal, an authority on cults for the Christian Democratic Union and well-known opponent of Scientology, who had claimed that the German Defence Minister had assured her that the film would not be shot in the country. In addition, Cruise\\'s affiliation with Scientology was also criticized by junior politicians such as Rudolf Köberle, the state secretary for interior issues in the state of Baden-Württemberg. Thomas Gandow, a spokesperson for the German Protestant Church, said Cruise\\'s involvement in the film would \"have the same propaganda advantages for Scientology as the 1936 Olympics had for the Nazis\" and compared the actor to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.\\n\\nThe film subsequently found local support in Germany. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck saw that Cruise\\'s involvement would promote awareness of a neglected story, and veteran German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl also gave his support to the production. A grandson of Colonel von Stauffenberg, who appeared in the film as an assistant, hailed Cruise\\'s professionalism and indicated that most of his family were curious to see the finished product. In September 2007, when the Defence Ministry initially denied permission for filming at the Bendlerblock memorial, support for the film came in from German newspaper columnists and filmmakers, including director Wolfgang Petersen and Frank Schirrmacher, journalist and co-publisher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Schirrmacher visited the set and agreed that the film would advance global awareness of the German Resistance. Ultimately granting access to the Bendlerblock after reviewing the script, the Defence Ministry said it showed that \"barbarism didn\\'t triumph but led to the founding of a democratic Germany\". Ursula Caberta, who is in charge of a German government office which monitors Scientology, was disappointed in the ministry\\'s decision, saying, \"Tom Cruise [is] a figurehead of an anti-constitutional organization, and he should be treated that way.\"A spokesperson for Scientology in Berlin, Sabine Weber, said in August 2007 that she was \"shocked\" by German politicians\\' criticisms, adding that it was a \"call to discrimination\" against someone based on their religious beliefs. In the same month, Cruise suggested to his critics that they see the film before denouncing it. In October 2007, fellow Valkyrie actor Kenneth Branagh said that the issue had been \"largely exaggerated\" and that the German official who initially incited the complaints contacted the production one week into filming to apologise, after reading the script and realising he had misinterpreted the film\\'s plot.In November 2007, the head of the German Resistance Memorial Centre warned against any potential \"myth formation\" around von Stauffenberg as a result of the film, urging that any understanding of the Colonel must also be informed by the fact that he had been loyal to the Nazi cause for most of his military career. In the same month Cruise was given a Bambi courage award, presented by German media company Hubert Burda Media, \"for tackling a story that had never been covered by Hollywood before\".Klaus Berg of the Hamburg Chronicle noted that \"... It is a well-known cliche that American film makers prefer to provide their audiences with a happy ending. Here, a viewer with even the most superficial and rudimentary knowledge of the history of the Second World War and of the National Socialist Regime would know from the very outset that a happy ending is out of the question, that all the protagonists\\' efforts and plans are doomed to end in bitter failure. Knowing this, I was surprised to realize how deeply I was caught up in the tension of the plot, how desperately I was hoping against hope that Cruise and his fellows would after all succeed. ... No, not for one minute during the entire film did I think about Scientology.\"\\n\\nMarketing\\nValkyrie was intended to be a high-profile film that would jump-start United Artists, the host studio partly owned by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner. Pressure was placed on Valkyrie to do well since an earlier United Artists film featuring Cruise, Lions for Lambs, performed poorly in the box office, and the studio\\'s planned production of Oliver Stone\\'s Pinkville was canceled. The film changed release dates multiple times. It was originally slated to be released on August 8, 2008, then moved up earlier to June 27, 2008. The film was then held off to October 3, 2008, to avoid competition from WALL-E and Wanted, and to enable the late filming of the North African battle sequence. The October date was also originally chosen to increase the film\\'s chances of awards success. In April 2008, the release date was pushed back to February 13, 2009, with the studio citing the early fall schedule as too crowded with Academy Award prospects. Valkyrie would have taken advantage of the lucrative President\\'s Day weekend, after The Wolfman and The Pink Panther 2 were moved from this date.In July 2008, United Artists president of worldwide marketing Dennis Rice was replaced by Michael Vollman, who was tasked to develop a marketing strategy for the \"troubled\" Valkyrie, which had been \"battered by constant media sniping\". Under Vollman, by August 2008, the release date was changed to December 26, 2008, with reports citing commercial reasons for the move after a successful test screening. (The film was ultimately released on Christmas Day, December 25, 2008.) The release date was before the end of December, which \"crucially\" helped the film with a home distribution deal with the subscription channel Showtime. In the same month of August, Paula Wagner left her position with the studio during the film\\'s post-production. The changing release date for Valkyrie drew criticism about the viability of United Artists, and the studio aimed to combat the criticism leading up to the film\\'s eventual release.  In addition, the first theatrical trailer, released early in 2008, received \"mixed buzz\" over Tom Cruise\\'s portraying von Stauffenberg with an American accent. The trade paper Variety described the trailer as \"dour and ... like it was selling a talky stage play with a cast of old British actors\". Images of Tom Cruise as Colonel von Stauffenberg that surfaced during filming were widely ridiculed. Terry Press, a marketing consultant with the studio, said that Valkyrie had been wrongly labeled as \"the Tom Cruise eye-patch movie\".As the December release date approached, United Artists launched a campaign to reform public perception of the film, downplaying the role of Tom Cruise as a German war hero and instead pitching Valkyrie as \"a character-driven suspense thriller\". The new campaign also played up the reputation of director Bryan Singer, who had directed the thrillers The Usual Suspects (1995) and Apt Pupil (1998). Terry Press urged foregoing an awards campaign for the film; Cruise agreed with the consultant, while Singer was disappointed about the decision. Instead, the studio focused on audience appeal in a competitive time frame in late December. A second theatrical trailer and a new poster were unveiled in October 2008 by United Artists to renew Valkyrie\\'s viability with audiences and accolades. The poster was designed to have flashy graphics and to emulate the posters from the war films The Great Escape (1963) and The Dirty Dozen (1967) in having a team as a central visual. The team element was based on market research from the studio\\'s focus groups who indicated that they liked Cruise as \"a character leading a group of people toward solving a problem\". The new trailer accentuated action, and was widely considered an improvement over the first trailer. An internal MGM memo reported the reception of the trailer by online communities to be \"significantly favorable\" compared to the previous trailer. The studio sought two demographic quadrants: males over 35 years old as well as younger males. Since United Artists reported that the film cost $75 million to make and that $60 million was spent on marketing, the studio faced high financial stakes. The film also tested the determination of its distributor Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and the mettle of Cruise as a superstar.\\n\\nRelease\\nTheatrical run\\nPrior to Valkyrie\\'s December 2008 release, concern was raised about how the film would be received in the holiday season due to its Nazi subject matter, along with related films The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, The Reader, Defiance and Good. Advertising Age wrote during the economic crisis of 2008, \"The depressing state of the economy and an alarmingly low level of understanding of the Holocaust among American youth point to a tough road for such serious fare.\"Valkyrie opened on Christmas Day, December 25, 2008, in 2,711 theaters in the United States and Canada. The film grossed an estimated $8.5 million for the opening day. In the four-day holiday weekend, Valkyrie grossed an estimated $30 million, ranking fourth at the box office with $7,942 per theater. Pamela McClintock of Variety cited the weekend performance as \"a victory for United Artists and MGM\"; Gitesh Pandya of Rotten Tomatoes said the haul represented a \"big hit\" for the studio. Studio research revealed that audiences averaged 55% male and 66% over 25. Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Media By Numbers, said that the weekend gross \"totally robs the nay-sayers of their ability to deem it a flop\", believing that Cruise\\'s comic performance in the previous summer\\'s Tropic Thunder helped audiences embrace the star again. Dergarabedian also ascribed the better-than-expected performance to the studio\\'s marketing of Valkyrie as a thriller film.  Since Cruise was collecting a salary of $20 million against 20% of the backend (revenue gathered after the completion of a film) and MGM/UA investment was capped at $60 million, United Artists sold the film to several foreign territories to make money back.The European premiere was held at the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin on January 20, 2009. Valkyrie commercially opened in over a dozen territories outside the United States and Canada on the weekend of January 23, 2009, including a premiere in Germany on January 22. The film ranked first in the international box office, grossing over $13 million. It placed first in Germany, Australia, and the Netherlands and placed second in the United Kingdom, Austria and South Korea. Valkyrie\\'s highest-grossing territory was Germany, where it earned $3.7 million from 689 locations, averaging $5,311 per screen. The German opening was considered \"a chart-topping yet unspectacular start\", barely edging out Twilight, which opened three weeks before.  BBC News reported that the premiere of the film has renewed the topic of the German Resistance among the German populace.The film opened in 13 additional territories on the weekend of January 30, including Russia and Spain. With 3,600 screenings in 26 markets, the film grossed $18.6 million to maintain its top placement at the international box office for a second weekend in a row. Spain was its highest-grossing territory with $2.8 million, followed by Germany with $2.3 million, the United Kingdom with $2 million, and $1.9 million in Italy. As of April 13, 2009, the film has grossed $83,079,000 in the United States and Canada and an estimated $117,198,951 in other territories for a worldwide gross of $200,276,784.\\n\\nAnti-Scientology protests\\nWhen Valkyrie premiered in New York City on December 15, 2008, it was shown in a private screening room at the Time Warner Center, rather than at a Lincoln Square theater. The venue was chosen in part to minimize the exposure to Scientology protesters gathered at the Time Warner Center.  While the US \"red carpet\" was held in private, Cruise interacted with fans in South Korea and Europe. There were small anti-Scientology protests at the European premiere in Berlin, where Cruise signed one protester\\'s Guy Fawkes mask. Anti-Scientology protests also occurred at the London premiere, and Amsterdam where Scientologists in the crowd engaged the protesters. The NTV news report about the January 26 Moscow premiere noted that journalists had to sign a document promising not to ask questions about Scientology, and their questions would be censored; to this, the reporter remarked, \"You can\\'t help getting reminded of those historic times depicted in Operation Valkyrie.\"In Germany, authorities and politicians expressed concern that if the film was successful, it would boost Scientology in the country. German politician Michael Brand encouraged his deputies to boycott Valkyrie, saying that Scientology pursued \"totalitarian goals\". Germany\\'s Agency for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), which monitors the presence of Scientology in the country, expressed concern about the film\\'s impact. An anonymous BfV official said, \"These Scientologists have two goals in Germany ... to get their message to children, and make their organization respectable. The film does both: it has put a top Scientologist at the center of a national debate about German history.\"In January 2009, Cruise appeared in the highly popular German-Swiss-Austrian TV show, Wetten, dass. Cruise had already left the show, when German comedian Michael Mittermeier said: \"In an interview, Tom Cruise claimed that he would have killed Hitler, too. To me, it would be sufficient if he had killed the Führer of Scientology.\" Prior to the show, members of the Christian Democratic Junge Union protested against the broadcaster for being uncritical about Scientology.\\n\\nHome media\\nValkyrie was released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 19, 2009, in three configurations: a single DVD edition, a two-DVD set, and a Blu-ray version. Valkyrie opened at #2 on the DVD sales chart, selling 844,264 units translating to revenue of $14,816,833. According to the latest figures, 1,631,011 units have been sold, bringing in $27,042,657 in revenue.\\n\\nReception\\nThe movie website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 62%, based on 196 reviews, with an average rating of 6.19/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Given the subject matter, Valkyrie could have been an outstanding historical thriller, but settles for being a mildly entertaining, but disposable yarn.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 56 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". In the United States, the film received mixed reviews from critics, however in Germany, there were different reports about how Valkyrie was received. The New York Times wrote, \"It has been greeted with a measured and hospitable reception in Germany, where it was once viewed with suspicion.\" The trade paper Variety reported that despite the controversy over Cruise\\'s ties to Scientology, \"[I]nitial reviews have been positive, with many observers now hailing Cruise and predicting the pic will even improve the country\\'s image abroad.\" Der Spiegel said that the film and its supporting actors were praised, but that Cruise was panned by German critics for \"a surprisingly low-key performance that fails to convey the charisma with which Stauffenberg inspired fellow plotters\". The AFP also said that the German critics \"savaged Tom Cruise\\'s portrayal\" of von Stauffenberg, yet \"relished a homegrown hero getting the Hollywood treatment\".\\n\\nAmerican critics\\nJoe Morganstern wrote in The Wall Street Journal, \"Mr. Cruise\\'s performance turns out to be brisk and reasonably plausible, though unexceptional, while the production as a whole succeeds as an elaborate procedural, impressively staged in historical locations.\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times thought that Cruise gave \"a fine, typically energetic performance in a film that requires nothing more of him than a profile and vigor\" but that von Stauffenberg was too complex a character to adequately portray in a film designed as a thriller. Dargis also wrote of the director\\'s excess, \"Though Mr. Singer\\'s old-fashioned movie habits, his attention to the gloss, gleam and glamour of the image, can be agreeably pleasurable, he tends to gild every lily,\" citing as an example the \"spooky music\" and \"low camera angles\" in the meeting between Hitler and von Stauffenberg. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also found Cruise \"perfectly satisfactory, if not electrifying, in the leading role\", believing that the portrayal fit the \"veterans of officer rank\" that would not panic under fire; Ebert recognizes that \"Singer ... works heroically to introduce us to the major figures in the plot, to tell them apart, to explain their roles and to suggest their differences.\"Writing in Time, Richard Schickel said, \"I\\'m not going to argue that Valkyrie is a great movie. But in its way it is a thoughtful and entertaining one, especially in comparison with the pomp and pretentiousness of most of the competition this holiday season.\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described the film: \"It\\'s a smooth, compelling, almost suspenseful ... and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece—a World War II action-drama in which an intriguing (but not electrifying) star performance is buttressed by stellar support.\" Burr analyzed Cruise\\'s performance: \"... his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that\\'s ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history. This story deserves to be told, but for reasons best known to himself, the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today thought of Cruise as \"unconvincing and stiff as the disenchanted\" von Stauffenberg. She felt that the film started slowly and that \"even during scenes of intense action, the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing\". She concluded of the film\\'s overall pace, \"The action becomes more engrossing during the film\\'s second half, but one expects more depth and nuance, given its pedigree.\" Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote, \"[Cruise] carries the movie, although, once you dig beneath the uniform, there isn\\'t much for him to get a handle on; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did, not in who he was.\" Lane thought that there was \"too much\" character acting of the British veteran actors and felt of the casting of Nighy, Stamp, and Wilkinson, \"These men are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis.\"Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that Valkyrie \"has visual splendor galore, but is a cold work lacking in the requisite tension and suspense\". McCarthy considered Cruise as \"a bit stiff but still adequate\" as von Stauffenberg. The critic believed that McQuarrie\\'s script was well-carpentered but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a \"sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters\". McCarthy missed \"many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men\" that were not detailed. He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out, that Newton Thomas Sigel\\'s cinematography had a \"restrained elegance\", and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer. A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote \"There\\'s nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand, strutting around in a German colonel\\'s uniform. But neither is there anything about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d\\'etat. Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.\\n\\nGerman critics\\nDespite differences over the quality of the film, critics were in agreement that the film had drawn attention to von Stauffenberg\\'s cause. It was applauded \"both as a history lesson and as a film\". Tobias Kniebe of the Süddeutsche Zeitung described the film as \"maybe not the masterpiece we might have dreamed of ... but not much less\", a sentiment shared by many German critics. The public-service German television channel ZDF called Valkyrie \"neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century. ... Neither is it the action thriller we feared, but it is a well-made and serious film.\" The newspaper Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger reported that any fear that the \"myth of the German resistance would be put through a Hollywood filter has turned out to be wrong and prejudicial\".Other critics thought that Tom Cruise did not \"make the grade\" as a German war hero. The film critic for Der Tagesspiegel wrote, \"[Cruise\\'s] image as an actor has been finally ruined by Valkyrie ... [the film] doesn\\'t dare to be popcorn cinema and at the same time lacks any conceptual brilliance.\" Hanns-Georg Rodek of Die Welt reported of Cruise\\'s performance, \"He comes over best as an American hero, someone who battles for respect with aggression and energy. But Stauffenberg was a German hero, with aristocratic bearing, and Cruise cannot carry that off.\" The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said Cruise\\'s performance was \"credible\", and reserved praise for the authenticity of the dubbed German-language version of the film over the original.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\nValkyrie was nominated by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films for seven Saturn Awards: Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, Best Director for Bryan Singer, Best Actor for Tom Cruise, Best Supporting Actor for Bill Nighy, Best Supporting Actress for Carice van Houten, Best Music for John Ottman and Best Costume for Joanna Johnston. The film was nominated by the Visual Effects Society Awards in the category of Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Feature Motion Picture.\\n\\nHistorical accuracy\\nThe Gestapo investigated the 20 July plot thoroughly, so filmmakers had access to much documentation as they integrated the historical account with \"Hollywood factors\" in producing Valkyrie. Peter Hoffmann, professor of history at McGill University and a leading authority on the German Resistance, was a consultant for the filmmakers. Hoffmann spoke of the film\\'s accuracy, \"[Valkyrie] gives a fundamentally accurate portrait of Stauffenberg and the conspirators. There are details which must be counted as liberties. But, fundamentally, the film is decent, respectful and represents the spirit of the conspiracy.\" The Scotsman reported of the film\\'s accuracy, \"Valkyrie ... sticks pretty closely to the story of the failed conspiracy to topple the Nazi regime ... it implies that the plot came closer to success than it really did. But the basic facts are all present and correct.\"While von Stauffenberg listens to Richard Wagner\\'s \"Ride of the Valkyries\" in the film, in reality the colonel hated Wagner. In addition, von Stauffenberg\\'s elder brother Berthold was also omitted from the film. Bryan Singer purposely left out some of von Stauffenberg\\'s \"macho\" moments in writing the character, such as the colonel\\'s refusal of morphine to avoid addiction. He explained the removals, \"There were things I actually left out because I knew people would think we were making them up ... imagine Tom Cruise saying \\'No morphine!\\' People would think it\\'s a contrivance.\" In the film, von Haeften steps out in front of von Stauffenberg when he faces the firing squad, but when filmmakers attempted to reconstruct the scene based on eyewitness testimony and photographs, they discovered that the shots that killed von Haeften would also have killed von Stauffenberg, who was actually shot shortly after. Another alteration was to the portrayal of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, played in the film by Kevin McNally. Goerdeler was written in the film to be antagonistic, dramatically representing the friction and conflict that existed within the conspiracy, though filmmakers considered him a \"much more moral character\" in reality.One significant historical alteration, made to avoid confusion with the audience and also to \"set the stage\" at the Wolf\\'s Lair, was changing the location of the first aborted assassination attempt to kill Hitler on July 11. Historically, Stauffenberg first attempted to use his briefcase bomb at Berchtesgaden; in the film, this attempt is set inside Hitler\\'s concrete bunker at the Wolf\\'s Lair while the Berchtesgaden affair is downgraded to a brief scene in which Hitler meets with Stauffenberg to approve a revised plan for Operation Valkyrie (in reality, the Valkyrie updates occurred over a period of several weeks at meetings between Hitler and General Olbricht). Producer Christopher McQuarrie later stated that the shift of the first assassination attempt to the Wolf\\'s Lair was in order to show the audience the inside of the concrete command bunker, with the intent being to emphasize that Hitler most certainly would have been killed had the July 20th attempt not been moved to the outdoor conference hut.British novelist Justin Cartwright, who wrote the book The Song Before It Is Sung about one of the plot\\'s conspirators, wrote, \"The film is true to most of the facts of the plot, but fails to convey any sense of the catastrophic moral and political vortex into which Germans were being drawn.\" Though not depicted, but briefly mentioned in the film, von Stauffenberg was persuaded to become involved in the plot by his uncle, Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband and his uncle\\'s good friend, Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg, who were both disenchanted with the Nazis and appalled by the atrocities in the concentration camps. The film also did not explore von Stauffenberg\\'s philosophy and background, which Cartwright felt fit the German tradition of Dichter und Helden (\"poets and heroes\"). Cartwright described how von Stauffenberg was an appropriate leader for the plot: \"He was the man who unmistakably wore the mantle of a near-mystic German past, a warrior Germany, a noble Germany, a poetic Germany, a Germany of myth and longing.\" The novelist felt that Cruise\\'s portrayal was more akin to one as a \"troublesome cop\". Cartwright also noted that the film did not raise the question of what kind of Germany von Stauffenberg had in mind if the plot succeeded.\\nThey did not mention or include Germany\\'s famous Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. He was implicated in the plot (and was later forced to commit suicide) although he refused participation.\\n\\nSee also\\nFilms and television based on the 20 July plot of 1944\\nList of American films of 2008\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website\\nValkyrie at IMDb\\nValkyrie at Rotten Tomatoes\\nValkyrie at Metacritic\\nValkyrie at Box Office Mojo',\n",
              " 'Vanilla Sky': 'Vanilla Sky is a 2001 American science fiction psychological thriller film directed, written, and co-produced by Cameron Crowe. It is an English-language adaptation of Alejandro Amenábar\\'s 1997 Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which was written by Amenábar and Mateo Gil, with Penélope Cruz reprising her role from the original film. The film has been described as \"an odd mixture of science fiction, romance and reality warp\".The film stars Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz, with Jason Lee and Kurt Russell in supporting roles. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song, as well as Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe Award nominations for Diaz\\'s performance.\\n\\nPlot\\nDavid Aames, the owner of a large publishing company he inherited from his father, is in prison. Wearing a prosthetic mask, David tells his life story to court psychologist Dr. Curtis McCabe.\\nIn flashbacks, David leaves the duties of the publisher to his father\\'s trusted associates while living as a playboy in Manhattan. He is introduced to Sofia Serrano by his best friend, Brian Shelby, during a party. David and Sofia spend the night together at Sofia\\'s apartment and fall in love, unaware that David\\'s current lover, Julie Gianni, has followed them there. As David leaves, Julie offers him a ride, and soon reveals her jealousy of Sofia. She purposely crashes the car, killing herself and drastically disfiguring David.\\nDoctors cannot completely repair David\\'s face using plastic surgery, leaving it scarred and misshapen. David wears a prosthetic mask around others, but the mental and physical scarring from the accident causes him to become withdrawn and depressed. Brian convinces David to join him and Sofia at a club, but David ends up drunk and insults the two. They leave him to wallow in the street outside the club.\\nThe next morning, Sofia returns to David, asleep on the street, and apologizes to him. She takes him home, and over time, helps David emotionally recover. Doctors find a way to surgically repair David\\'s face despite their prior prognosis. While David\\'s life seems perfect, he notices strange oddities, such as brief visions of his distorted face, and a man at a bar who tells David that he could control the world and everyone in it. One day, while at Sofia\\'s, David wakes up to find himself facing Julie, with all the photos of Sofia\\'s face replaced by Julie\\'s. Out of confusion and shock, he suffocates Julie. David is arrested and imprisoned, and finds his face no longer reconstructed and he\\'s once again wearing the mask.\\nDr. McCabe conducts several more interviews, which serve to help David to recall the name \"Life Extension\". Seeing a company with that name nearby, McCabe arranges to take David there under guard. The company representative Rebecca explains how Life Extension uses cryonic suspension to save those with terminal illnesses until a cure can be found, keeping them in a lucid dream state to otherwise exercise their mind. David realizes that he is in his own lucid dream, escapes McCabe and the guards while calling for \"tech support\", and rushes for the building\\'s lobby, which is suddenly empty. An elevator opens, revealing the strange man from the bar, who invites him in.\\nAs the elevator climbs to the top of an impossibly tall building, the man explains to David he is tech support, and that David has been in suspension for 150 years, starting shortly after the night at the club where Sofia broke up with him. David opted for Life Extension to be woken when technology could repair his face, and left the publishing company in the hands of his father\\'s associates. As part of the program, David had opted for a lucid dream based on the \"vanilla sky\" from a Claude Monet painting The Seine at Argenteuil, starting the morning after Sofia\\'s breakup. However, the equipment had merged elements of his subconscious, such as Julie, or McCabe as his father figure, within his dream, forcing them to pull him out of the lucid dream state.\\nThey emerge on the rooftop, high above the clouds. Tech support tells David that while they have fixed his lucid dream, he has a choice of either being put back into the dream, or to be woken up in reality, requiring a literal leap of faith off the roof that will wake him from his sleep. David opts to wake up, despite a vision of McCabe warning him against it. Before jumping, David envisions Brian and Sofia to say his goodbyes. David jumps and his life flashes before his eyes before hitting the ground. A female voice commands him to \"open your eyes\", and David opens his eyes.\\n\\nAlternative ending version\\nThe 2015 Blu-ray release offers the option to watch the film with an alternative ending. This ending expands on the details at the end of the film. While it all leads to the same conclusion, there are additional scenes, alternative takes, and alternative dialogue.\\nAfter Rebecca describes the lucid dream, David rushes out of the room but does not immediately dash towards the elevator. He meets McCabe in the restroom who tries to convince him that this is all a hoax and a con and that his case is going to trial. David tells him that he\\'s only in his imagination. Much like in the theatrical cut, the Beach Boys\\' \"Good Vibrations\" plays, but this version makes it clear that David hears the music and that he chose it; meanwhile McCabe tries to convince him there is no music.\\nAt this point, David dashes out of the restroom for the elevator the way he does in the theatrical cut, but the scene in the lobby is expanded: David shoots the police officer who is firing at him and is then surrounded by a SWAT team whom McCabe tries to talk down, but the SWAT team fires at both of them. They black out and wake up in the emptied lobby where McCabe continues to applaud what he believes is a performance while David gets into the elevator with Ventura, who tells him what happened at the end of his real life.\\nOnce they reach the roof, McCabe re-enters again and his pleas to David not to believe Ventura become more and more desperate until he collapses onto the ground in despair. David\\'s interaction with Sofia is extended as he tells her he loves her but \"can\\'t settle for a dream\". He then jumps off the building, screaming \"I want to wake up!\" as images from his life flash before his eyes. He wakes up in bed and a voice tells him \"Open your eyes. You\\'re going to be fine.\"\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nAfter the American debut of Alejandro Amenábar\\'s 1997 Spanish film Abre los ojos (Open Your Eyes) at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, Tom Cruise and his producing partner Paula Wagner optioned the remake rights. Hoping to entice director Cameron Crowe, who collaborated with Cruise on Jerry Maguire, Cruise invited Crowe over to his house to view the film. Cruise has stated:\\n\\nI\\'ve been offered a lot of films to buy and remake, and I never have because I felt it was too connected with the culture of that place, whatever country it was from. But this was a universal story that was still open-ended, that still felt like it needed another chapter to be told.\\n\\nThe title of the film is a reference to depictions of skies in certain paintings by Claude Monet. In addition to Monet\\'s impressionistic artwork, the film\\'s tone was derived from the acoustic ballad \"By Way of Sorrow\" by Julie Miller and a line from an early interview of Elvis Presley in which he said, \"I feel lonely, even in a crowded room.\"\\n\\nFilming\\nPrincipal photography for Vanilla Sky began in late 2000 and lasted six weeks. On November 12, 2000, shooting for the scene of the deserted Times Square in New York took place in the early hours of the day. A large section of traffic was blocked off around Times Square while the scene was shot. \"There was a limit on how long the city would let us lock everything up even on an early Sunday morning when much of NYC would be slow getting up,\" said Steadicam operator Larry McConkey. \"Several times we rehearsed with Steadicam and Crane including a mockup of an unmovable guardrail that we had to work the crane arm around. [Cruise] participated in these rehearsals as well so we shared a clear understanding of what my limitations and requirements would be.\"Filming lasted for six weeks around the New York City area, which included scenes in Central Park, the Upper West Side, SoHo, and Brooklyn. One prominent location in the area was the Condé Nast Building that served as Aames Publishing and David\\'s office. After filming finished in New York, production moved to Los Angeles, where the remaining interior shots were completed at Paramount Studios. Crowe intentionally left in shots of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks as a tribute.Despite the film\\'s distorted aspects of reality, the style of cinematography remains grounded for much of the film. \"I didn\\'t do anything that was overtly obvious, because the story revolves around the main character not knowing whether he\\'s in a state of reality, a dream or a nightmare, so we want it to feel a little ambiguous,\" said cinematographer John Toll. \"We want the audience to make discoveries as [Cruise]\\'s character does, rather than ahead of him.\" American Cinematographer magazine wrote a feature story on the lighting designer Lee Rose\\'s work on the film.\\n\\nMusic\\nAside from the opening sequence featuring Radiohead\\'s song \"Everything in its Right Place\" and selected works by Icelandic group Sigur Rós, Vanilla Sky\\'s score was by Crowe\\'s then wife, Nancy Wilson, who also scored Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous. Wilson spent nine months on the film\\'s music, which was done through experimentation of sound collages. \"We were trying to balance out the heaviness of the story with sugary pop-culture music,\" she said. \"We made sound collages of all kinds. We were channeling Brian Wilson to a large extent. I was recording things through hoses, around corners, playing guitars with cello bows, and with [music editor] Carl Kaller, we tried all kinds of wacky stuff. In the murder–sex scene sound collage, Cameron even used Brian Wilson\\'s speaking voice from a Pet Sounds mix session.\"\\n\\nInterpretations\\nAccording to Cameron Crowe\\'s commentary, there are five different interpretations of the ending:\\n\\n\"Tech support\" is telling the truth: 150 years have passed since Aames killed himself and subsequent events form a lucid dream.\\nThe entire film is a dream, evidenced by a sticker on Aames\\' car that reads \"2/30/01\" (February 30 does not occur in the Gregorian calendar).\\nThe events following the crash form a dream that occurs while Aames is in a coma.\\nThe entire film is the plot of the book that Brian is writing.\\nThe entire film after the crash is a hallucination caused by the drugs that were administered during Aames\\' reconstructive surgery.Crowe notes that the presence of \"Vanilla Sky\"—the morning reunion after the club scene—marks the first lucid dream scene, and that everything that follows is a dream.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nVanilla Sky opened at #1 at the box office in the United States when it was first presented on December 14, 2001. The opening weekend took in a gross income of $25,015,518 (24.9%). The final domestic gross income was $100.61 million while the international gross income was slightly higher at $102.76m for a total worldwide gross income of $203,388,341.\\n\\nCritical response\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 42% based on reviews from 170 critics, and an average rating of 5.34/10. The site\\'s consensus states: \"An ambitious mix of genres, Vanilla Sky collapses into an incoherent jumble. Cruise\\'s performance lacks depth, and it\\'s hard to feel sympathy for his narcissistic character.\" On Metacritic it has a score of 45 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating \"Mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"D-\" on a scale from A to F.Roger Ebert\\'s printed review of Vanilla Sky awarded the film three out of four stars: \"Think it all the way through, and Cameron Crowe\\'s Vanilla Sky is a scrupulously moral picture. It tells the story of a man who has just about everything, thinks he can have it all, is given a means to have whatever he wants, and loses it because—well, maybe because he has a conscience. Or maybe not. Maybe just because life sucks. Or maybe he only thinks it does. This is the kind of movie you don\\'t want to analyze until you\\'ve seen it two times.\" Ebert interpreted the ending as an explanation for \"the mechanism of our confusion\", rather than a device that tells \"us for sure what actually happened.\"Film critic Richard Roeper ranked the film the second best of 2001.Stephen Holden of The New York Times calls Vanilla Sky a \"highly entertaining, erotic science-fiction thriller that takes Mr. Crowe into Steven Spielberg territory\", but then says: \"As it leaves behind the real world and begins exploring life as a waking dream (this year\\'s most popular theme in Hollywood movies with lofty ideas), Vanilla Sky loosens its emotional grip and becomes a disorganised and abstract if still-intriguing meditation on parallel themes. One is the quest for eternal life and eternal youth; another is guilt and the ungovernable power of the unconscious mind to undermine science\\'s utopian discoveries. David\\'s redemption ultimately consists of his coming to grips with his own mortality, but that redemption lacks conviction.\"Salon.com called Vanilla Sky an \"aggressively plotted puzzle picture, which clutches many allegedly deep themes to its heaving bosom without uncovering even an onion-skin layer of insight into any of them.\" The review rhetorically asks: \"Who would have thought that Cameron Crowe had a movie as bad as Vanilla Sky in him? It\\'s a punishing picture, a betrayal of everything that Crowe has proved he knows how to do right. ... But the disheartening truth is that we can see Crowe taking all the right steps, the most Crowe-like steps, as he mounts a spectacle that overshoots boldness and ambition and idiosyncrasy and heads right for arrogance and pretension—and those last two are traits I never would have thought we\\'d have to ascribe to Crowe.\" Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film 2/4 and wrote: \"The film\\'s aim—to dazzle and inspire—is sapped by Cruise\\'s vein-popping, running-the-marathon performance.\"Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian and Gareth Von Kallenbach of the publication Film Threat compared Vanilla Sky unfavorably to Open Your Eyes. Bradshaw says Open Your Eyes is \"certainly more distinctive than\" Vanilla Sky, which he describes as an \"extraordinarily narcissistic high-concept vanity project for producer-star Tom Cruise.\" Other reviewers extrapolate from the knowledge that Cruise had bought the rights to do a version of Amenábar\\'s film. A Village Voice reviewer characterized Vanilla Sky as \"hauntingly frank about being a manifestation of its star\\'s cosmic narcissism\".Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called Cameron Diaz \"compelling as the embodiment of crazed sensuality\" and The New York Times reviewer said she gives a \"ferociously emotional\" performance. Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly says of the film, \"most impressive is Cameron Diaz, whose fatal-attraction stalker is both heartbreaking and terrifying.\" For her performance, Diaz won multiple critics\\' groups awards, as well as being nominated for the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics\\' Choice Movie Award, Saturn Award, and AFI Award. Penélope Cruz\\'s performance, however, earned her a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress (in addition to her roles in Blow and Captain Corelli\\'s Mandolin).\\n\\nSee also\\nSimulated reality in fiction\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nEyes and Ears for Vanilla Sky at Cameron Crowe\\'s Official website\\nVanilla Sky at IMDb\\nVanilla Sky at AllMovie',\n",
              " 'Variety (magazine)': 'Variety is an American media company owned by Penske Media Corporation. The company was founded by Sime Silverman in New York City in 1905 as a weekly newspaper reporting on theater and vaudeville. In 1933 it added Daily Variety, based in Los Angeles, to cover the motion-picture industry. Variety.com features breaking entertainment news, reviews, box office results, cover stories, videos, photo galleries and features, plus a credits database, production charts and calendar, with archive content dating back to 1905.\\n\\nHistory\\nFoundation\\nVariety has been published since December 16, 1905, when it was launched by Sime Silverman as a weekly periodical covering theater and vaudeville with its headquarters in New York City. Silverman had been fired by The Morning Telegraph in 1905 for panning an act which had taken out an advert for $50. As a result, he decided to start his own publication \"that [would] not be influenced by advertising.\" With a loan of $1,500 from his father-in-law, he launched Variety as publisher and editor. In addition to The Morning Telegraph, other major competitors on launch were The New York Clipper and the New York Dramatic Mirror.The original cover design, which is very similar to the current design, was sketched by Edgar M. Miller, a scenic painter, who refused payment. The front cover contained pictures of the original editorial staff, who were Alfred Greason, Epes W Sargeant (Chicot or Chic) and Joshua Lowe, as well as Sime. The first issue contained a review by Sime\\'s son Sidne, also known as Skigie (based on the childish lisping of his name) who was claimed to be the youngest critic in the world at seven years old.In 1922 Silverman acquired The New York Clipper which had been reporting on the stage and other entertainment since 1853, in an attempt to attract advertising revenue away from Billboard, following a dispute with William Donaldson, the owner of Billboard. Silverman folded it two years later after spending $100,000, merging some of its features into Variety. The same year, he launched the Times Square Daily, which he referred to as \"the world\\'s worst daily\" and soon scrapped. During that period, Variety staffers worked on all three papers.\\nAfter the launch of The Hollywood Reporter in 1930 Silverman launched the Hollywood-based Daily Variety in 1933 with Arthur Ungar as the editor. It replaced Variety Bulletin that was issued in Hollywood on Fridays as a four-page wraparound to the Weekly. Daily Variety was initially published every day other than Sunday but mostly on Monday to Friday. The Daily and the Weekly were initially run as virtually independent newspapers, with the Daily concentrating mostly on Hollywood news and the Weekly on U.S. and International coverage.\\n\\nDeath of Sime\\nSilverman had passed on the editorship of the Weekly Variety to Abel Green as his replacement in 1933. He remained as publisher until his death later that year, soon after launching Daily Variety. Sime\\'s son Sidne succeeded him as publisher of both publications but upon contracting tuberculosis in 1936 he could no longer take a day to day role at the paper. Green, the editor, and Harold Erichs, the treasurer and chief financial officer, ran the paper during his illness. Following Sidne\\'s death in 1950, his only son Syd Silverman, was the sole heir to what was then Variety Inc. Young Syd\\'s legal guardian Erichs, who had started at Variety as an office boy, assumed the presidency.Ungar remained editor of Daily Variety until his death in 1950.\\nHe was followed by Joe Schoenfeld.In 1953 Army Archerd took over the \"Just for Variety\" column on page two of Daily Variety and swiftly became popular in Hollywood. Archerd broke countless exclusive stories, reporting from film sets, announcing pending deals, giving news of star-related hospitalizations, marriages, and births. The column appeared daily for 52 years until September 1, 2005.Erichs continued to oversee Variety until 1956. After that date, Syd Silverman managed the company as publisher of both the Weekly Variety in New York and the Daily Variety in Hollywood.\\nThomas M. Pryor, former Hollywood bureau chief of The New York Times, became editor of Daily Variety in 1959. Under Pryor, Daily Variety expanded from 8 pages to 32 pages and also saw circulation increase from 8,000 to 22,000.Green remained as editor of Variety until his death in 1973, with Syd taking over the role.\\n\\nAcquisition by Cahners\\nIn 1987, Variety was sold to Cahners Publishing for $64 million. In December 1987, Syd handed over editorship of Variety to Roger Watkins. After 29 years as editor of Daily Variety, Tom Pryor handed over to his son Pete in June 1988.On December 7, 1988, Watkins proposed and oversaw the transition to four-color print. Upon its launch, the new-look Variety measured one inch shorter with a washed-out color on the front. The old front-page box advertisement was replaced by a strip advertisement, along with the first photos published in Variety since Sime gave up using them in the old format in 1920: they depicted Sime, Abel and Syd.For 20 years from 1989, Variety\\'s editor-in-chief was Peter Bart, originally only of the weekly New York edition, with Michael Silverman (Syd\\'s son) running the Daily in Hollywood. Bart had worked previously at Paramount Pictures and The New York Times. \\nSyd Silverman remained as publisher until 1990 when he was succeeded on Weekly Variety by Gerard A. Byrne and on Daily Variety by Sime\\'s great grandson, Michael Silverman. Syd became chairman of both publications.In April 2009 Bart moved to the position of \"vice president and editorial director\", characterized online as \"Boffo No More: Bart Up and Out at Variety\". From mid 2009 to 2013, Timothy M. Gray oversaw the publication as Editor-in-Chief, after over 30 years of various reporter and editor positions in the newsroom.\\n\\nAcquistion by Penske Media Corporation\\nIn October 2012 Reed Business Information, the periodical\\'s owner, (formerly known as Reed-Elsevier, which had been parent to Cahner\\'s Corp. in the United States) sold the publication to Penske Media Corporation. PMC is the owner of Deadline Hollywood, which since the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike has been considered Variety\\'s largest competitor in online showbiz news. In October 2012, Jay Penske, Chairman and CEO of PMC, announced that the website\\'s paywall would come down, the print publication would stay, and he would invest more into Variety\\'s digital platform in a townhall.In March 2013 owner Penske appointed three co-editors to oversee different parts of the publication\\'s industry coverage; Claudia Eller as Editor, Film; Cynthia Littleton as Editor, TV; and Andrew Wallenstein as Editor, Digital. The decision was also made to stop printing Daily Variety with the last printed edition published on March 19, 2013 with the headline \"Variety Ankles Daily Pub Hubbub\".In October 2014 Eller and Wallenstein were upped to Co-Editors in Chief, with Littleton continuing to oversee the trade\\'s television coverage. In June 2014, Penske Media Corporation (PMC) entered into an agreement with Reuters to syndicate news from Variety and Variety Latino-Powered by Univision to distribute leading entertainment news to the international news agency\\'s global readership. This dissemination comes in the form of columns, news stories, images, video, and data-focused products. In July 2015, Variety was awarded a Los Angeles Area Emmy Award by the Television Academy in the Best Entertainment Program category for Variety Studio: Actors on Actors, a series of one-hour specials that take viewers inside Hollywood films and television programs through conversations with acclaimed actors. A second Los Angeles Area Emmy Award was awarded in 2016.\\nIn June 2019, Variety shut down its Gaming section.A significant portion of the publication\\'s advertising revenue comes during the film-award season leading up to the Academy Awards. During this \"Awards Season\", large numbers of colorful, full-page \"For Your Consideration\" advertisements inflate the size of Variety to double or triple its usual page count. These advertisements are the studios\\' attempt to reach other Hollywood professionals who will be voting on the many awards given out in the early part of the year, including the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes and various guild award honors.\\n\\nEditions\\nVariety (first edition published December 16, 1905) is a weekly entertainment publication with a broad coverage of movies, television, theater, music and technology, written for entertainment executives. It is published weekly and delivered internationally.\\nDaily Variety (first edition published September 6, 1933 and last published March 19, 2013) was the name of the Los Angeles-based Hollywood and Broadway daily edition. The Daily Variety brand was revived in 2019 as a Mon-Fri email newsletter presenting the top stories of the last 24 hours. Top stories are also posted on the Daily Variety page of Variety.com.\\nDaily Variety Gotham, (first edition published March 16, 1998) was the name of the New York City-based edition which gave a priority focus to East Coast show-business news and was produced earlier in the evening than the Los Angeles edition so it could be delivered to New York the following morning.\\nVariety.com (launched January 5, 1998) is the Internet version of Variety. It was initially divided into two tiers with a free area and a subscription area (variety.extra) that had full text of the daily and additional features, which was one of the first online newspapers to charge for access when it launched. In June 2010, all content on the website became paywalled. The paywall was removed in April 2013, although access to additional content, such as the archives, require subscription.\\nVariety On-The-Go Variety is also available as an app on the iPad, iPhone, Android, Blackberry, and Windows phone. This app is an interactive content-driven platform providing entertainment industry updates on the go.\\n@Variety is available across multiple social media platforms and channels, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr, with videos streaming on variety.com and on the \"Variety\" YouTube channel.On December 15, 1906, Variety published its first anniversary edition containing 64 pages, double the size of a regular edition. It regularly published large anniversary editions each year, most often at the beginning of January, normally with a review of the year and other charts and data, including, from 1938 onwards, lists of the top performing films of the year and, from 1949, the annually updated all-time rental chart. The editions also contained many advertisements from show business personalities and companies. The 50th anniversary edition was the largest issue at the time, containing 516 pages. The 100th anniversary edition was published in October 2005, listing Variety\\'s icons of the century.As well as the large anniversary editions, Variety also published special editions containing much additional information, charts and data (and advertising). The 22nd International Film Edition published in May 1979 contained a then record 568 pages. Other large editions were published regularly for the following film festivals:\\n\\nCannes Film Festival\\nMIFED Film Market\\nAmerican Film MarketDaily Variety also published an anniversary issue each October. This regularly contained a day-by-day review of the year in show business and in the 1970s started to contain republication of the film reviews published during the year.Older back issues of Variety are available on microfilm. In 2010, Variety.com allowed access to digitized versions of all issues of Variety and Daily Variety with a subscription. Certain articles and reviews prior to 1998 have been republished on Variety.com. The Media History Digital Library has scans of the archive of Variety from 1905 to 1961 available online.\\n\\nCirculation\\nThe first issue of Variety sold 320 copies in 1905.Paid circulation for the weekly Variety magazine in 2013 was 40,000 (Source: BPA Audit Statement, 2013). Each copy of each Variety issue is read by an average of three people, with an estimated total readership of 120,000 (Source: Ipsos Subscriber Study, 2013). Variety.com has 17 million unique monthly visitors (Source: Google Analytics, 2015).\\n\\nCulture\\nFor much of its existence, Variety\\'s writers and columnists have used a jargon called slanguage or varietyese (a form of headlinese) that refers especially to the movie industry, and has largely been adopted and imitated by other writers in the industry. The language initially reflected that spoken by the actors of the early days during the newspaper.Such terms as \"legit\", \"boffo\", \"sitcom\", \"sex appeal\", \"payola\", and \"striptease\" are attributed to the magazine. Its attempt to popularize \"infobahn\" as a synonym for \"information superhighway\" never caught on. Television series are referred to as \"skeins\", and heads of companies or corporate teams are called \"toppers\". In addition to a stylistic grammatical blip – very frequent omissions of the definite article the –, more-common English words and phrases are shortened; \"audience members\" becomes simply \"auds\", \"performance\" \"perf\", and \"network\" becomes \"net\", for example.\\nIn 1934, founder Sime Silverman headed a list in Time magazine of the \"ten modern Americans who have done most to keep American jargon alive\".According to The Boston Globe, the Oxford English Dictionary cites Variety as the earliest source for about two dozen terms, including \"show biz\" (1945). In 2005, Welcome Books published The Hollywood Dictionary by Timothy M. Gray and J. C. Suares, which defines nearly 200 of these terms.\\nOne of its popular headlines was during the Wall Street Crash of 1929: \"Wall St. Lays An Egg\". The most famous was \"Sticks Nix Hick Pix\" (the movie-prop version renders it as \"Stix nix hix pix!\" in Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), Michael Curtiz\\'s musical–biographical film about George M. Cohan starring James Cagney).\\nIn 2012 Rizzoli Books published Variety: An Illustrated History of the World from the Most Important Magazine in Hollywood by Gray. The book covers Variety\\'s coverage of hundreds of world events, from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, through Arab Spring in 2012, and argues that the entertainment industry needs to stay aware of changes in politics and tastes since those changes will affect their audiences. In a foreword to the book, Martin Scorsese calls Variety \"the single most formidable trade publication ever\" and says that the book\\'s content \"makes you feel not only like a witness to history, but part of it too.\"\\nIn 2013 Variety staffers tallied more than 200 uses of weekly or Daily Variety in TV shows and films, ranging from I Love Lucy to Entourage.In 2016 Variety endorsed Hillary Clinton for President of the United States, marking the first time the publication endorsed a candidate for elected office in its 111-year history.\\n\\nOffice locations\\nVariety\\'s first offices were in the Knickerbocker Theatre located at 1396 Broadway on 38th and Broadway in New York. Later it moved to 1536 Broadway at the 45th and Broadway corner until Loew\\'s acquired the site to build the Loew\\'s State Theatre. In 1909, Variety set up its first overseas office in London.In 1920 Sime Silverman purchased an old brownstone building around the corner at 154 West 46th Street in New York, which became the Variety headquarters until 1987, when the publication was purchased. Under the new management of Cahners Publishing, the New York headquarters of the Weekly Variety was relocated to the corner of 32nd Street and Park Avenue South. Five years later, it was downgraded to a section of one floor in a building housing other Cahner\\'s publications on West 18th Street, until the majority of operations were moved to Los Angeles.When Daily Variety started in 1933, its offices were in various buildings near Hollywood Blvd. and Sunset Blvd. In 1972, Syd Silverman purchased a building at 1400 North Cahuenga Blvd. which housed the Daily\\'s offices until 1988, after which its new corporate owners and new publisher, Arthur Anderman, moved them to a building on the Miracle Mile on Wilshire Boulevard.\\nIn late 2008 Variety moved its Los Angeles offices to 5900 Wilshire, a 31-story office building on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile area. The building was dubbed the Variety Building because a red, illuminated \"Variety\" sign graced the top of the building.In 2013 PMC, the parent company of Variety, announced plans to move Variety\\'s offices to their new corporate headquarters at 11175 Santa Monica Blvd. in Westwood. There, Variety shares the 9-story building with parent company PMC, Variety Insight, Variety 411, and PMC\\'s other media brands, including Deadline.com, HollywoodLife.com, GoldDerby.com, Robb Report and the West Coast offices of WWD and Footwear News.\\n\\nContent\\nFilm reviews\\nOn January 19, 1907, Variety published what is considered the first film review in history. Two reviews written by Sime Silverman were published: Pathé\\'s comedy short An Exciting Honeymoon and Edison Studios\\' western short The Life of a Cowboy, directed by Edwin S. Porter.Variety discontinued reviews of films between March 1911 until January 1913 as they were convinced by a film producer, believed to be George Kleine, that they were wasting space criticising moving pictures and others had suggested that favourable reviews brought too strong a demand for certain pictures to the exclusion of others. Despite the gap, Variety is still the longest unbroken source of film criticism in existence.In 1930 Variety also started publishing a summary of miniature reviews for the films reviewed that week and in 1951 the editors decided to position the capsules on top of the reviews, a tradition retained today.\\n\\nReviewers\\' pen names\\nWriting reviews was a side job for Variety staff, most of whom were hired to be reporters and not film or theatre critics. Many of the publication\\'s reviewers identified their work with four-letter pen names (\"sigs\") rather than with their full names. The practice stopped in August 1991. Those abbreviated names include the following:\\nAbel - Abel Green, editor 1931–1973\\nAnby - Vincent Canby, 1951–1957, later chief film critic for The New York Times\\nArmy - Army Archerd\\nBell - Harry Ennis\\nBesa - Peter Besas\\nBige - Joe Bigelow\\nBing - Claude Binyon\\nCart - Todd McCarthy, 1979–1989; film review editor 1991–2010.\\nChic - Epes W Sargeant\\nDrek - Derek Elley\\nEdba - Ed Barry\\nGene - Gene Arneel\\nHawk - Robert Hawkins\\nHerm - Herman Schoenfeld\\nHoll and Hyho - Hy Hollinger, 1953–1960, 1979–1992\\nJolo - Joshua Lowe\\nLait - Jack Lait\\nLey - Joe Leydon\\nMurf - Arthur D. Murphy, the principal film critic from December 1964 until October 1978.\\nPry - Thomas M. Pryor, editor of Daily Variety from 1959 until his retirement in 1988.\\nRush - Alfred Greason\\nSid or Skig - Sidne Silverman, Variety publisher and Sime\\'s son.\\nSime - Sime Silverman, founder of Variety and the first to write a film review for the paper.\\nSisk - Robert Sisk, formerly a writer of \"news letters\" for The Sun in Baltimore, Maryland.\\nSyd - Syd Silverman, Sime\\'s grandson\\nThe Skirt - Hattie Silverman, Sime\\'s wife\\nUng - Arthur Ungar, first Daily Variety editor\\nWhit - Whitney Williams\\n\\nReprints of reviews\\nVariety is one of the three English-language periodicals with 10,000 or more film reviews reprinted in book form. These are contained in the 24-volume Variety Film Reviews (1907–1996). Film reviews continue to be published in Variety. The other two periodicals are The New York Times (as The New York Times Film Reviews (1913–2000) in 22 volumes) and Harrison\\'s Reports (as Harrison\\'s Reports and Film Reviews (1919–1962) in 15 volumes).\\nIn 1992 Variety published the Variety Movie Guide containing a collection of 5,000 abridged reviews edited by Derek Elley. The last edition was published in 2001 with 8,500 reviews. Many of the abridged reviews for films prior to 1998 are published on Variety.com unless they have later posted the original review.\\n\\nObituaries\\nThe complete text of approximately 100,000 entertainment-related obituaries (1905–1986) was reprinted as Variety Obituaries, an 11-volume set, including alphabetical index. Four additional bi-annual reprints were published (for 1987–1994) before the reprint series was discontinued.\\nThe annual anniversary edition published in January would often contain a necrology of the entertainment people who had died that year.\\n\\nCharts and data\\nVariety started reporting box office grosses for films by theatre on March 3, 1922, to give exhibitors around the country information on a film\\'s performance on Broadway, which was often where first run showings of a film were held. In addition to New York City, they also endeavored to include all of the key cities in the U.S. in the future and initially also reported results for ten other cities including Chicago and Los Angeles. They continued to report these grosses for films until 1989 when they put the data into a summarized weekly chart and only published the data by theatre for New York and Los Angeles as well as other international cities such as London and Paris.\\nAs media expanded over the years, charts and data for other media such as TV ratings and music charts were published, especially in the anniversary editions that were regularly published each January.\\nDuring the 1930s charts of the top performing films of the year were published and this tradition has been maintained annually since.In 1946 a weekly National Box Office survey was published on page 3 indicating the performance of the week\\'s hits and flops based on the box office results of 25 key U.S. cities.Later in 1946 a list of All-Time Top Grossers with a list of films that had achieved or gave promise of earning $4,000,000 or more in domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals was published. An updated chart was published annually for over 50 years, normally in the anniversary edition each January.In the late 1960s Variety started to use an IBM 360 computer to collate the grosses from their weekly reports of 22 to 24 U.S. cities from January 1, 1968. The data came from up to 800 theatres which represented around 5% of the U.S. cinema population at the time but around one-third of the total U.S. box office grosses. In 1969, they started to publish the computerized box office compilation of the top 50 grossing films of the week based on this data. \"The Love Bug\" was the number one in the first chart published for the week ending April 16, 1969. The chart format was changed in 1989 to reduce the list to a top 40 and display a summary of the sample city theater grosses rather than publish the theater grosses separately. The sample chart was discontinued in 1990.Arthur D. Murphy, who joined Variety in 1964 and worked there until 1993, was one of the first to organize and chart domestic box office gross information that became more available during the 1980s and report it in a meaningful form setting a standard for how film box office information is reported today. Murphy used the weekly sample reports to estimate the total US weekly box office compared with previous annual totals which was reported in Variety\\'s US Boxoffice Report each week. The sample also allowed Murphy to estimate the Market Share percentage rankings of distributors.In 1976 the Variety Box Office Index (VBI) was launched where each month\\'s actual key city box office tally, after seasonal adjustment, was simultaneously expressed as an index number, with 1970 as a whole being used as the base initially. The current month\\'s VBI expressed the monthly box office performance as a percentage change from the base year. The index was published until 1991 giving a history of comparable monthly and annual box office performance for the past 20 years.\\nDuring the 1980s, Daily Variety started to publish a weekly chart of the domestic box office grosses of films as compared to the Top 50 chart in Variety which was based on a sample of key markets. Variety started to publish this weekend box office report together with the sample Top 50 chart (later top 40) until they discontinued the sample chart in February 1990 with the weekend box office report being their main source of box office reporting.In 2009 Variety launched a chart showcasing the top performing film trailers ahead of theatrical release in partnership with media measurement firm Visible Measures.\\n\\nOther Variety products\\nIn 1937 Variety compiled and published a Radio Directory compiling a record of events in radio such as program histories, ratings and popularity polls. It published an annual edition for the next three years which are available on the Media History Digital Library.\\nIn 1981, Variety International Showbusiness Reference was published, which they claimed was the first book to contain a complete list of all winners and nominees for the Academy Awards, Emmy Awards, Tony Awards, Grammy Awards and Pulitzer Prize. The following year they published Variety major U.S. showbusiness awards containing just this award details and a revised edition, called Variety presents the complete book of major U.S. show business awards, was published in 1985.In 1988, R.R. Bowker, a Reed Reference Publishing Company, part of Reed-Elsevier, PLC, a \"sister\" company to Variety, published Variety\\'s Video Directory Plus, a CD-ROM subscription product, updated quarterly, containing metadata about 90,000 home video products and full-text film reviews from Variety.\\nPeter Cowie joined Variety in 1989 and his International Film Guide, which had been published annually since 1964, became Variety International Film Guide with reports from countries on the year in cinema as well as information of film festivals. It continued to bear Variety\\'s name until 2006.In 1990 Variety published a 15-volume set of its television reviews (including home video product) from 1923 to 1988. Additional supplements were published covering 1989–1990, 1991-1992 and 1993–1994.In 1999 Cowie published The Variety Insider with detailed information on the year in entertainment as well as historical information. A second edition followed in 2000.\\n\\nVariety Studio: Actors on Actors\\nIn November 2014 Variety premiered Variety Studio: Actors on Actors, a co-production with PBS SoCal that featured two actors discussing their craft and thoughts on Hollywood, which subsequently went on to win three Emmy awards, including a Daytime Creative Arts Award in May 2019.\\nIn January 2017 they launched the Variety Content Studio, creating custom content for brands.\\n\\nVariety Business Intelligence\\nVariety established its data and research division, Variety Insight, in 2011 when it acquired entertainment data company, TVtracker.com. Its film database was announced in December 2011 as FlixTracker, but was later folded into Variety Insight. Variety positioned the subscription service as an alternative to crowd-sourced websites, such as the IMDb. The database uses Variety\\'s existing relationships with the studios to get information. The New York Observer identified the main competitor as Baseline StudioSystems. In 2014, Variety Insight added Vscore, a measure of actors\\' cachet and bankability. In 2015, they partnered with ScriptNoted, a social media website for film scripts.\\n\\nSee also\\nThe Hollywood Reporter\\nDeadline Hollywood, sister competing entertainment trade news publication also under ownership of Penske Media Corporation\\nList of film periodicals\\n\\nReferences\\nCitations\\nGeneral bibliography\\nPeter Besas, Inside Variety (Madrid: Ars Millenii, 2000) The 563-page book gives a detailed history of the newspaper (it was never called a \"magazine\" under the Silvermans) from its birth in 1905 to its sale in 1987.\\nSime\\'s Site http://simesite.net/ (web page run by pre-corporate (Silverman era) employees of Variety)\\n\\nExternal links\\nVariety.com website\\nVariety magazine (1905–1961) from Media History Digital Library at the Internet Archive',\n",
              " 'War of the Worlds (2005 film)': 'War of the Worlds is a 2005 American science fiction action film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Josh Friedman and David Koepp, loosely based on the 1898 similarly-titled novel by H. G. Wells and jointly produced and released by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures. It stars Tom Cruise with Dakota Fanning, Justin Chatwin, Miranda Otto, and Tim Robbins in supporting roles. It also features narration by Morgan Freeman. The film follows an American dock worker who is forced to look after his children, from whom he lives separately, as he struggles to protect them and reunite them with their mother when extraterrestrials invade the Earth and devastate cities with giant war machines. This was Gene Barry\\'s final film before his retirement that year and his death in 2009.\\nThe film was shot in 73 days, using five different sound stages as well as locations in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia. The film was surrounded by a secrecy campaign so few details would be leaked before its release. Tie-in promotions were made with several companies, including Hitachi.\\nWar of the Worlds was released in North America on June 29, 2005 and in United Kingdom on July 1, 2005, by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly those of Cruise and Fanning), Spielberg\\'s direction, screenplay, action sequences and visual effects. It grossed over $603 million worldwide, making it the fourth most successful film of 2005. The film earned three Academy Awards nominations for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing.\\n\\nPlot\\nThe plot begins with an opening narration explaining that Earth was being observed by extraterrestrials with immense intelligence and no compassion. As man dominated the world without doubt, much like microorganisms swarming in a drop of water, these beings plotted to take it all from us.\\nDivorced longshoreman Ray Ferrier works as a crane operator at a dock in Brooklyn, New York, and is estranged from his children: 10-year-old daughter Rachel, and teenage son Robbie. Ray\\'s pregnant former wife, Mary Ann, drops the two off at his house in Bayonne, New Jersey, on her way to visit her parents in Boston.\\nLater, a strange storm occurs during which lightning strikes multiple times into the middle of a local intersection, causing an EMP that disrupts all technology and electricity. Ray joins the crowd at the scene of the impacts, where a massive \"tripod\" war machine emerges from the ground and uses powerful energy weapons to destroy the area, disintegrating most of the witnesses into a grey dust. Ray collects his children, steals a van that had just been repaired, and drives to Mary Ann\\'s empty home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge. That night, they take shelter in the basement, but they soon hear a strange roaring noise followed by an explosion, which destroys the house. The next morning, Ray discovers a Boeing 747 had crashed into the neighborhood wherein he meets a wandering news team surveying the wreckage and scavenging meals from it. The team explains to him there are multiple tripods that have attacked major cities around the world, adding that the tripods have force shields to protect them from human weapons, and the tripods\\' pilots traveled to Earth within the lightning storms as a way to enter their machines, which are assumed to have been buried underground for millions of years.\\nRay decides to drive the kids to Boston to be with their mother, but a desperate mob swarms their vehicle, forcing them to abandon it. They eventually get to a Hudson River ferry only to be surrounded by tripods, which either massacre or abduct many of the refugees, but Ray\\'s family manages to escape. They then witness U.S. Marines engaging in a futile battle with some tripods; Ray tries to stop Robbie from joining the fight, but is reluctantly forced to release him so he can take Rachel to safety. Ray and Rachel flee as the machines annihilate the marines, and are offered shelter in a farmhouse basement by a deranged man named Harlan Ogilvy.\\nThe three remain undetected for several days, even as a probe and a group of the tripods\\' alien pilots explore the basement. They soon discover the aliens have started cultivating a red-colored vegetation across the landscape that is quickly spreading; the group deduces the aliens are modifying Earth to make it more like their home planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown upon witnessing the tripods harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Fearing Ogilvy\\'s mad shouting will alert the aliens, Ray reluctantly kills him. A second tripod probe catches the Ferriers sleeping; Rachel flees and is abducted by a nearby tripod, and Ray joins her after picking up a belt of grenades. With help from other abductees, Ray uses the grenades to destroy the tripod from within, freeing them all.\\nRay and Rachel arrive in Boston, where they find the alien vegetation withering and the tripods inexplicably collapsing. When an active tripod appears, Ray notices birds landing on it, indicating that its shields are now offline. Ray successfully alerts the soldiers escorting the fleeing crowd, who shoot it down using anti-tank missiles. As the soldiers advance on the downed tripod, a hatch opens and a sickly alien struggles halfway out before dying. Ray and Rachel finally reach Mary Ann\\'s parents\\' house, where they are reunited with Mary Ann and Robbie (who somehow managed to survive).\\nA closing narration explains the aliens\\' deaths was due to their immune systems being unable to handle the countless billions of microbes that inhabit the Earth, and that humanity has \"earned\" the right to the planet by virtue of naturally coexisting with the rest of its biosphere.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nAfter collaborating in 2002\\'s Minority Report, Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise were interested in working together again. Spielberg stated about Cruise, \"He\\'s such an intelligent, creative partner, and brings such great ideas to the set that we just spark each other. I love working with Tom Cruise.\" Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg\\'s Catch Me If You Can (2002) and gave three options of films to create together, one of them being an adaptation of The War of the Worlds. Spielberg chose The War of the Worlds and stated, \"We looked at each other and the lights went on. As soon as I heard it, I said \\'Oh my God! War of the Worlds – absolutely.\\'  That was it.\"The film is Spielberg\\'s third on the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and longtime collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. \"When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. Now, he\\'s telling that story.\" Spielberg stated that he just thought it would be fun to make a \"really scary film with really scary aliens\", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.\\nJ. J. Abrams was asked by Spielberg and Cruise to write the script but had to turn down the film as he was working on the plot for his television series Lost. Josh Friedman delivered a screenplay, which was then rewritten by David Koepp. After re-reading the novel, Koepp decided to do the script following a single narrator, \"a very limited point of view, from someone on the very periphery of events rather than someone involved in events\", and created a list of elements he would not use due to being \"cliché\", such as the destruction of landmark buildings. Some aspects of the book were heavily adapted and condensed: Tim Robbins\\' character was an amalgam of two characters in the book, with the name borrowed from a third. While changing the setting from 19th century to present day, Koepp also tried to \"take the modern world back to the 1800s\", with the characters being devoid of electricity and modern techniques of communication.Spielberg accepted the script after finding it had several similarities to his personal life, including the divorce of his parents (Ray and Mary Ann\\'s divorce), and because the plight of the fictional survivors reflects his own uncertainty after the devastation of the September 11 attacks. For Spielberg, the characters\\' stories of survival needed to be the main focus, as they featured the American mindset of never giving up. Spielberg described War of the Worlds as \"a polar opposite\" to Close Encounters, with that movie featuring a man leaving family to travel with aliens, while War of the Worlds focused on keeping the family together. At the same time, the aliens and their motivations would not be much explored, as \"we just experience the results of these nefarious plans to replace us with themselves\".Although accepting the script, Spielberg asked for several changes. Spielberg had been against the idea of the aliens arriving in spaceships, since every alien invasion movie used such a vehicle. The original Martian cylinders were discarded, where Spielberg replaced the origins of the Tripods with stating they were buried underground in the Earth long ago.Spielberg had Miranda Otto in mind for the part of Mary Ann, but at the time he called her she was pregnant and thought the opportunity would be missed. Spielberg then decided to incorporate Otto\\'s pregnancy into the film, changing the part for her.\\nLawrence Brown wrote: \"Spielberg\\'s decision to present the invaders\\' fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which did not exist in the original Wells book. In Spielberg\\'s version, these invaders had been here before, long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself – a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers – and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us – all humans over the whole of history – have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be \\'harvested\\'\".\\n\\nFilming\\nFilming took place in Virginia, Connecticut, New Jersey, California, and New York. The film shooting lasted an estimated 72 days. Spielberg originally intended to shoot War of the Worlds after Munich, but Tom Cruise liked David Koepp\\'s script so much that he suggested Spielberg postpone the former while he would do the same with Mission: Impossible III. Most of Munich\\'s crew was brought in to work on War of the Worlds as well. In 2004, the production crews quickly were set up on both coasts to prepare for the start date, scouting locations up and down the Eastern Seaboard and preparing stages and sets which would be used when the company returned to Los Angeles after the winter holiday. Pre-production took place in only three months, essentially half the amount of time normally allotted for a film of similar size and scope. Spielberg notes, however, \"This wasn\\'t a cram course for War of the Worlds. This was my longest schedule in about 12 years. We took our time.\" Spielberg collaborated with crews at the beginning of pre-production with the use of previsualization, considering the tight schedule.The scene depicting the first appearance of the Tripods was filmed at the intersection of Ferry Street, Merchant Street, and Wilson Avenue, in Newark, New Jersey. Later, Spielberg filmed several scenes in Virginia. The continuous scene was filmed in California.The ferry scene was filmed in the New York town of Athens, and Mary Ann\\'s parents\\' house was located in Brooklyn (but was featured in the film in Boston). For the neighborhood plane crash scene, the production crew bought a retired Boeing 747 formerly operated by All Nippon Airways as JA8147, with transportation costs of $2 million, dismantled it into several pieces, and built houses around them. The destroyed plane was kept for the Universal Studios back-lot tour. Ray\\'s house was filmed in Bayonne, New Jersey (with a soundstage doubling the interior); meanwhile, the valley war sequence was filmed in Lexington, Virginia and Mystery Mesa in California. The scene where the tripod is shot down and crashes through a factory was filmed in Naugatuck, Connecticut at an abandoned chemical plant. The scene of the bodies floating down the river was filmed on the Farmington River in Windsor, Connecticut by a second unit using a stand in for Dakota Fanning shot from behind with the portion showing the faces of the credited actors cut in later. Some filming was shot on the Korean War Veterans Parkway in Staten Island, NY. The film used six sound stages, spread over three studio lots.Principal photography began on November 8, 2004 and wrapped on March 7, 2005.\\n\\nDesign and visual effects\\nIndustrial Light & Magic was the main special effects company for the movie. While Spielberg had used computers to help visualize sequences in pre-production before, Spielberg said, \"This is the first film I really tackled using the computer to animate all the storyboards.\" He decided to employ the technique extensively after a visit to his friend George Lucas. In order to keep the realism, the usage of computer-generated imagery shots and bluescreen was limited, with most of the digital effects being blended with miniature and live-action footage.The design of the Tripods was described by Spielberg as \"graceful,\" with artist Doug Chiang replicating aquatic life forms. At the same time, the director wanted a design that would be iconic while still providing a tribute to the original Tripods, as well as intimidating so the audience would not be more interested about the aliens inside than on the vehicle itself. The visual effects crew tried to blend organic and mechanical elements in the Tripods depiction, and made extensive studies for the movements of the vehicle to be believable, considering the \"contradiction\" of having a large tank-like head being carried by thin and flexible legs. Animator Randal M. Dutra considered the movements themselves to have a \"terrestrial buoyance\", in that they were walking on land but had an aquatic flow, and Spielberg described the Tripods as moving like \"scary ballet dancers\". Most of the alien elements revolved around the number three – the Tripod had three eyes, and both the vehicle and the aliens had three main limbs with three fingers each.Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman considered depicting the scale of the Tripod as challenging, considering \"Steven wanted to make sure that these creatures were 150 feet tall\", as it was the height described by Wells in the novel. The aliens themselves had designs based on jellyfish, with movements inspired by red-eyed tree frogs, and an amphibian quality particularly on the wet skin. A styrofoam alien was used as a stand-in to guide the actors in the basement scene. Spielberg did not want any blood or gore during the Heat-Ray deaths; in the words of Helman, \"this was going to be a horror movie for kids\". So the effects crew came up with the vaporization of the bodies, and considering it could not be fully digital due to both the complexity of the effect and the schedule, live-action dust was used alongside the CGI ray assimilation and particles. Digital birds followed the Tripods in most scenes to symbolize the presence of death, which Chiang compared to vultures and added that \"you don\\'t know if these birds are going to the danger or away from it, if you should follow them or run away.\"During the scene where Ray\\'s stolen minivan is attacked by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, flashlights and Maglights. The IL&M crew admitted that the destruction of the Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer. The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards the minivan and the minivan\\'s escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.Costume designer Joanna Johnston created 60 different versions of Ray\\'s leather jacket, to illustrate the degrees to which he is weathered from the beginning of the journey to the end. \"He begins with the jacket, a hoodie, and two t-shirts,\" explains Johnston. One piece of Dakota Fanning\\'s costume that takes on a special importance is her lavender horse purse: \"I wanted her to have something that made her feel safe, some little thing that she could sleep with and put over her face,\" Johnston notes. \"That was the lavender horse purse. We tied it up on a ribbon and Dakota hung it on her body, so it was with her at all times.\" Johnston dressed Robbie for an unconscious emulation of his father, \"They\\'re more alike than they realize, with great tension on the surface,\" Johnston says.\\n\\nMusic\\nLongtime Spielberg collaborator John Williams composed the music score of War of the Worlds. It was the first time Williams had to compose with an incomplete Spielberg film, as only the first six reels, totalling sixty minutes, were ready for him to use as reference. He considered the score \"a very serious piece,\" which had to combine \"necessary frightening atmosphere\" with \"propulsively rhythmic drive for the action scenes\" – the music would be symbolically \"pulling forward\" vehicles in chase scenes such as Ray driving out of Bayonne or the Tripod attacking the Hudson ferry. Williams added small nods to classic monster movie scores by having orchestras doing a \"grand gesture\" in scenes overlooking Tripods. To increase the scariness, Williams added a female chorus with a crescendo resembling a shriek – which would \"humanize\" the track representing \"victims that go out without saying an \\'ouch\\' – they\\'re gone before they can say that\" – for the Tripod attacks, and a nearly inaudible male choir – which Williams compared to \"Tibetan monks, the lowest known pitch our bodies can make\" – for the aliens exploring the basement. The only deviation from orchestras were electronic sounds for the opening and closing narrations.A soundtrack album was released by Decca Records, that featured the film\\'s music and Morgan Freeman\\'s opening and closing narration. The songs \"Little Deuce Coupe\" and \"Hushabye Mountain\" are also featured in the movie, the former sung by Tom Cruise, and the latter by Dakota Fanning.\\n\\nThemes\\nThe film was described as an anti-war film, as civilians run and only try to save themselves and their family instead of fighting back against the alien Tripods. Debra J. Saunders of San Francisco Chronicle described the film as \"If aliens invade, fight.\" Saunders compared the film to Independence Day, where the civilians do run, but they support the military efforts. Many reviewers considered the film tried to recreate the atmosphere of the September 11 attacks, with bystanders struggling to survive and the usage of missing-persons displays. Spielberg declared to Reader\\'s Digest that beside the work being a fantasy, the threat represented was real: \"They are a wake-up call to face our fears as we confront a force intent on destroying our way of life.\" Screenwriter David Koepp stated that he tried not to put explicit references to September 11 or the Iraq War, but said that the inspiration for the scene where Robbie joins the Marines was teenagers fighting in the Gaza Strip – \"I was thinking of teenagers in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks at tanks, and I think that when you\\'re that age you don\\'t fully consider the ramifications of what you\\'re doing and you\\'re very much caught up in the moment and passion, whether that\\'s a good idea or not.\"  Retained from the novel is the aliens being defeated, not by men\\'s weapons, but the planet\\'s smallest creatures, bacteria, which Koepp described as \"nature, in a way, knowing a whole lot more than we do\".\\n\\nRelease\\nWar of the Worlds premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre on June 23, 2005. There, Tom Cruise revealed his relationship with Katie Holmes. Six days later, on June 29, the film was released in approximately 3,908 theaters across America. The home video was subsequently released on November 22, 2005.\\n\\nSecrecy\\nSpielberg kept most of the parts secret in the filmmaking, as the cast and crew were left confused about how the aliens looked. When asked about the secrecy of the screenplay, David Koepp answered, \"[Spielberg] wouldn\\'t give [the screenplay] to anybody\". Koepp explained he would e-mail it to him, and he would give a section of the script that was relating to whatever somebody was doing. Miranda Otto thought of not even discussing the story with her family and friends. Otto said, \"I know some people who always say, \\'Oh, everything\\'s so secret.\\' I think it\\'s good. In the old days people didn\\'t get to know much about movies before they came out and nowadays there\\'s just so much information. I think a bit of mystery is always really good. You don\\'t want to blow all of your cards beforehand.\"Spielberg admitted after keeping things secret for so long, there is in the end the temptation to reveal too much to the detriment of the story at the press conference of War of the Worlds. So, Spielberg only revealed the hill scene, where Ray tries to stop his son from leaving, stating \"to say more would reveal too much.\" The actual budget of the film was $132 million.According to Vanity Fair, Spielberg\\'s relations with Cruise were \"poor\" during the film\\'s release because Spielberg believed Cruise\\'s \"antics\" at the time (such as an erratic appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show) had \"hurt\" the film and after a doctor whose name Spielberg had given to Cruise was picketed by Scientologists.\\n\\nMarketing and home media releases\\nParamount Pictures Interactive Marketing debuted a human survival online game on its official website, on April 14 to promote the film. Hitachi collaborated with Paramount Pictures for a worldwide promotional campaign, under the title of \"The Ultimate Visual Experience\". The agreement was announced by Kazuhiro Tachibana, general manager of Hitachi\\'s Consumer Business Group. Kazuhiro stated, \"Our \\'The Ultimate Visual Experience\\' campaign is a perfect match between Spielberg and Cruise\\'s pursuit of the world\\'s best in film entertainment and Hitachi\\'s commitment to the highest picture quality through its digital consumer electronic products.\"The film was released on VHS and DVD on November 22, 2005, with both a single-disc edition and a two-disc special edition which included production featurettes, documentaries and various trailers. The film grossed $113,000,000 in DVD sales, bringing its total film gross to $704,745,540, ranking tenth place in the 2005 DVD sales chart. Paramount released the film on Blu-ray Disc on June 1, 2010.\\n\\nReception\\nBox office\\nOn June 29, 2005 (2005-06-29), the film grossed approximately US$81 million worldwide, and earned the thirty-eighth biggest opening week by grossing $98,826,764 in 3,908 theatres, averaging out to $25,288 in each theater. Meanwhile, on Independence Day weekend, War of the Worlds grossed $64,878,725 in 3908 theatres also, giving an average of $16,601. This is the third-biggest film opening on Independence Day weekend.  The film earned $200 million in 24 days, ranking thirty-seventh place in the list of fastest films to gross $200 million. The film has grossed $704,745,540 including DVD sales, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 2005, and the 66th highest-grossing film worldwide.\\n\\nCritical reaction\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, War of the Worlds holds a 75% approval rating based on 264 reviews and an average rating of 7.00/10. The critical consensus states: \"Steven Spielberg\\'s adaptation of War of the Worlds delivers on the thrill and paranoia of H.G. Wells\\' classic novel while impressively updating the action and effects for modern audiences.\" Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the film an average score of 73 out of 100 based on 40 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". On IMDb, the film has a rating of 6.6/10 stars based on reviews from Top 1000 voters.\\nJames Berardinelli praised the acting and considered that focusing the narrative on the struggle of one character made the film more effective, but described the ending as weak, even though Spielberg \"does the best he can to make it cinematically dramatic\". Total Film\\'s review gave War of the Worlds four out of five stars, considering that \"Spielberg finds fresh juice in a tale already adapted for film, TV, stage, radio and record\", and describing the film as having many \"startling images\", comparing the first Tripod attack to the Omaha Beach landing from Saving Private Ryan.Los Angeles Times\\' Kenneth Turan, who commended the film\\'s special effects, stated that Spielberg may actually have done his job in War of the Worlds \"better than he realizes\". Turan claimed that, by \"showing us how fragile our world is\", Spielberg raises a provocative question: \"Is the ultimate fantasy an invasion from outer space, or is it the survival of the human race?\" However, Broomfield Enterprise\\'s Dan Marcucci and Nancy Serougi did not share Berardinelli and Turan\\'s opinion. They felt that Morgan Freeman\\'s narration was unnecessary, and that the first half was \"great\" but the second half \"became filled with clichés, riddled with holes, and tainted by Tim Robbins\".Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing \"War of the Worlds definitely wins its battle, but not the war.\" Wilmington stated that the film \"takes [viewers] on a wild journey through two sides of [Spielberg]: the dark and the light.\" He also said the film contained a core sentiment similar to that of Spielberg\\'s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. About.com\\'s Rebecca Murray gave a positive review, stating, \"Spielberg almost succeeds in creating the perfect alien movie\", with criticism only for the ending. Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader praised the special effects and Cruise\\'s performance. Roger Ebert criticized the \"retro design\" and considered that despite the big budget, the alien invasion was \"rudimentary\" and \"not very interesting\", regarding the best scenes as Ray walking among the airliner wreckage and a train running in flames, declaring that \"such scenes seem to come from a kind of reality different from that of the tripods.\"The French film magazine Cahiers du cinéma ranked the film as 8th place in its list of best films of the 2000s. Japanese film director Kiyoshi Kurosawa listed the film as the best film of 2000–2009.\\n\\nAccolades\\nWar of the Worlds was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Visual Effects (Pablo Helman), Sound Mixing (Andy Nelson, Anna Behlmer and Ron Judkins), and Sound Editing, losing all to King Kong. The film was nominated for six Saturn Awards, and won Best Performance by a Younger Actor (Dakota Fanning). The film won a Golden Reel Award for Sound Effects & Foley, a World Soundtrack Award for Best Original Soundtrack, and three VES Awards for its special effects,  and was nominated for three Empire Awards, three Satellite Awards, and an MTV Movie Award.\\n\\nSee also\\nThe War of the Worlds, 1953 film\\nBook:War of the Worlds\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial Dreamworks website\\nWar of the Worlds at IMDb\\nWar of the Worlds at AllMovie\\nWar of the Worlds at Facebook\\nWar of the Worlds at the TCM Movie Database\\nWar of the Worlds at the American Film Institute Catalog\\nWar of the Worlds at Rotten Tomatoes\\nWar of the Worlds at Box Office Mojo\\nWar of the Worlds at Metacritic',\n",
              " 'Without Limits': 'Without Limits is a 1998 American biographical sports film. It is  written and directed by Robert Towne and follows the relationship between record-breaking distance runner Steve Prefontaine and his coach Bill Bowerman, who later co-founded Nike, Inc. Billy Crudup plays Prefontaine and Donald Sutherland plays Bowerman. It also stars Monica Potter, Jeremy Sisto, Judith Ivey, Matthew Lillard and William Mapother.\\nThe film was produced by Tom Cruise (Cruise and Mapother are cousins) and Paula Wagner, and released and distributed by Warner Bros. Due to a very low-key promotional campaign, the $25 million film grossed only $777,000 at the box office, although it received good reviews from many major critics. Sutherland received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the film.\\n\\nCast\\nBilly Crudup as Steve Prefontaine\\nDonald Sutherland as Bill Bowerman\\nMonica Potter as Mary Marckx\\nJeremy Sisto as Frank Shorter\\nJudith Ivey as Barbara Bowerman\\nDean Norris as Bill Dellinger\\nBilly Burke as Kenny Moore\\nFrank Shorter as Fred Long\\nMatthew Lillard as Roscoe Devine\\nWilliam Mapother as Bob Peters\\n\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\n20 years prior the film\\'s release, Kenny Moore, a friend of late Steve Prefontaine, approached Robert Towne with the intention of making a film about Prefontaine but Towne was unavailable at the time. Three years later,  the two worked together on the film Personal Best and they again explored the idea. In 1994, the two met and Moore began writing a script for Towne to direct. Mary Marckx, Prefontaine\\'s former girlfriend and friend of Moore, gave Towne over 200 personal letters written by Prefontaine, which provided an insight into his thoughts and she also shared information on the relationship he had with his mother. Explaining how Tom Cruise got involved in the project, Moore said: Robert and I happened to be working on a project with Tom Cruise, who is also a runner and was training for a triathlon at that time. Robert showed him seven minutes of Fire on the Track, a documentary about Steve Prefontaine. Tom immediately loved the story and wanted to see it made as a dramatic feature.\\n\\nCasting\\nTowne originally envisioned Cruise in the role of Prefontaine, but it was decided he was too old. For the role, Billy Crudup who had been a college athlete trained for four months with Patrice Donnelly (she starred in Personal Best) to run short distances as he was expected to run 110 to 200 yards for a 5,000 meter race sequence. He also watched actual footage of Prefontaine to imitate his moves. Tommy Lee Jones, Harrison Ford and Clint Eastwood were considered for the part of Bowerman but they all turned it down and Donald Sutherland eventually landed the role. Monica Potter played the role of Prefontaine\\'s girlfriend and spent a lot of time with Mary Marckx to prepare for the part.\\n\\nFilming\\nThe film was shot on location in Oregon using the University of Oregon\\'s Hayward Field. Scenes were also filmed at Heceta Beach, Oregon. Bill Bowerman\\'s house served as a shooting location. After two months of filming in Oregon, the production moved to Los Angeles to film the Munich sequences at Citrus College. Some visuals of the Munich Olympics came from the documentary Visions of Eight: Because Disney wouldn\\'t let us use ABC\\'s coverage, we were stuck for footage of the race. But then we found, in the vault at Warner Bros., outtakes from [the 1972 Olympics documentary] Visions of Eight So we were very lucky because we found perfect, unexposed 35mm film of that race that had never been put into any other film. The result is that you have full shots of Munich stadium and shots of Steve waist-high that cut to Billy and back, and you can\\'t tell the difference.\\n\\nReception\\nWithout Limits met with positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 79% \"fresh\" approval rating with an average score of 6.6/10, based on 38 reviews. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"This drama about American track star and hero Steve Prefontaine intelligently looks at the character of this oft mythologized athlete and features a fantastic performance by Donald Sutherland as Prefontaine\\'s trainer.\"\\n\\nSee also\\nPrefontaine (film)\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nWithout Limits at IMDb'}"
